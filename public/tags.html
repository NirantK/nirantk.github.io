I know that there is a book for the first 90 days as an executive. Is there something similar for programmers?
I don&rsquo;t quite know of a book/essay which covers this yet sticks to the question. So I am writing one for him.
The First 90 Days for a New Engineer I expect each step to take roughly between 10 and 30 days, depending on the pace of your project + size of the team.

This is the guide which I sometimes send to our candidates after they submit the Programming Challenge. If a candidate has relevant open source code sample, specially to other repositories we may choose to waive off the Programming Challenge completely.
I originally wrote this to give a chance to folks coming from non-NLP background to get a sense of the problem space a little better.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Talent Cooling Kills Startup Growth Evaporative Cooling [1] occurs when the most high value contributors to a community realize that the community is no longer serving their needs any more and so therefore, leave.
Then something remarkably interesting happens:
 When that happens, it drops the general quality of the community down such that the next most high value contributors now find the community underwhelming. Each layer of disappearances slowly reduces the average quality of the group until such a point that you reach the people who are so unskilled-and-unaware of it that they’re unable to tell that they’re part of a mediocre group.

        Thinking of Your Career as a Startup

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Broadly speaking, it’s useful to think of your career as a startup.
Your profit+growth percentage should be a minimum 40%
So say, you join a big company like Microsoft and your skills grow at 20% every year, while your pay only grows 10% - that&rsquo;s bad.
You need to grow your skills and outcomes faster.
The other extreme is also fine: You join a small startup which can make great use of entrepreneurial DNA plus specific skills.

    <div class="nested-links f5 lh-copy nested-copy-line-height">
      Why we need to do a reference check on startup teams we work with? Great Startups always ask someone who is joining for a reference check. They speak to your previous managers and colleagues. There is no reason why candidates should not do the same. Many startup employees have more opportunity costs than the founders themselves.
I&rsquo;m surprised by the lack of due diligence which candidates do when interviewing with us.

I am writing from my non-existent but probably relevant experience. I worked in a Machine Learning role at Samsung Research, Bengaluru. It is only 1 of the 4 research enterprises which hire Machine Learning researchers from Indian colleges — the other being Microsoft, Xerox, and IBM Watson.
I am now in a even more Computer Vision focused role for a small enterprise tech company.

      The Silent Rise of PyTorch Ecosystem While Tensorflow has made peace with Keras as it’s high level API and mxNet now support Gluon — PyTorch is the bare matrix love.
PyTorch has seen rapid adoption in academia and all the industrial labs that I have spoken to as well. One of the reasons people (specially engineers doing experiments) like PyTorch is the ease of debugging.
What I don’t like about PyTorch is it’s incessant requirement of debugging because of inconsistent dimensions problems.

      Shreyas Karanth is a Product Manager at Soroco. Soroco is a Medium-sized Enterprise-focussed B2B Automation company. Before Product Management, Shreyas was the fastest growing engineer - going from a fresh grad to a Technical Lead within 3 years of graduation.
This is also when I worked with him, during his engineering days. Here, I asked a bunch of questions why he moved to Product Management, what excites him and what he considers as Product Management work at Soroco.

 Quick Hacks pandas-profiling If you are logging confidence scores, you can begin there. The quickest hack is to visualize with pandas-profiling: https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/
Rolling means Calculate rolling aggregates (e.g. mean, variance) of your confidence scores.

 Net Worth is the Sum Total of the Assets &amp; Liabilities

      Talent Cooling Kills Startup Growth Evaporative Cooling [1] occurs when the most high value contributors to a community realize that the community is no longer serving their needs any more and so therefore, leave.
Then something remarkably interesting happens:
 When that happens, it drops the general quality of the community down such that the next most high value contributors now find the community underwhelming. Each layer of disappearances slowly reduces the average quality of the group until such a point that you reach the people who are so unskilled-and-unaware of it that they’re unable to tell that they’re part of a mediocre group.

I’ve organized my setbacks by year (starting with 2016), and what constitutes a “failure” (or fail) here is based solely on my own judgement. It’s important to not only list the failures, but also learn from them, so I will add reflections to some of them (in progress).

 Quick Hacks pandas-profiling If you are logging confidence scores, you can begin there. The quickest hack is to visualize with pandas-profiling: https://github.com/pandas-profiling/pandas-profiling/
Rolling means Calculate rolling aggregates (e.g. mean, variance) of your confidence scores.
