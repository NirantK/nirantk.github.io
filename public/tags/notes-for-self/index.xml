      <description>On Death   Is usually better the sooner it happens. Just like it’s best to retire from your cricket career at your peak for your own sake, it’s best to die when you are at your peak. You just might become Father of the Nation.
  No one wishes that they’d accomplished less on their death beds. You might hear that no one wishes that they’d worked more. That’s right too.</description>
