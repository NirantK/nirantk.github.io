      <description>This quick entry is partially inspired by a similar entry from Manas Saloi. Ofc, other folks have offered their opinions on Basecamp and earlier Coinbase.
The woke mob is shitting on Jason and DHH, but I strongly agree with Basecamp’s new policies. IMHO a company is supposed to create an environment where people come and do their best work without having to align to one side of the political spectrum.</description>

      <description>Who is this for? Practitioners who are looking to level up their game in Deep Learning
Why Do We Need Instructions on How to Read a Deep Learning Paper? Quantity: There are more papers than we can humanly read even within our own niche. For instance, consider EMNLP - which is arguably the most popular Natural Language Processing conference selects more than 2K papers across a variety of topics. And NLP is just one area!</description>

      <title>Character is Net Worth</title>

      <guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/character-is-net-worth.html</guid>
      <description>A useful metaphor to think about character of a person is their financial “net worth”. Like your net worth, this does not mean that you have that much cash to spend. It is a sum total of something.
 Net Worth is the Sum Total of the Assets &amp;amp; Liabilities
Character is the Sum Total of the Decisions you Own: Good and Bad
 Like your Net Worth can be negative due to a large liability e.</description>

      <guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/first-90-days-engineer-version.html</guid>
      <description>Aditya Ankur, asked me:
I know that there is a book for the first 90 days as an executive. Is there something similar for programmers?
I don&amp;rsquo;t quite know of a book/essay which covers this yet sticks to the question. So I am writing one for him.
The First 90 Days for a New Engineer I expect each step to take roughly between 10 and 30 days, depending on the pace of your project + size of the team.</description>

      <title>Verloop NLP Interview Prep Guide</title>

      <guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/verloop-ml-prep-guide.html</guid>
      <description>Preparation Guide I&amp;rsquo;ve been an early Machine Learning Engineer at Verloop.io for almost 1.5 years, primarily working on NLP problems and now more in an Engineering Manager-ish role.
This is the guide which I sometimes send to our candidates after they submit the Programming Challenge. If a candidate has relevant open source code sample, specially to other repositories we may choose to waive off the Programming Challenge completely.
I originally wrote this to give a chance to folks coming from non-NLP background to get a sense of the problem space a little better.</description>

      <description>Talent Cooling Kills Startup Growth Evaporative Cooling [1] occurs when the most high value contributors to a community realize that the community is no longer serving their needs any more and so therefore, leave.
Then something remarkably interesting happens:
 When that happens, it drops the general quality of the community down such that the next most high value contributors now find the community underwhelming. Each layer of disappearances slowly reduces the average quality of the group until such a point that you reach the people who are so unskilled-and-unaware of it that they’re unable to tell that they’re part of a mediocre group.</description>

      <description>Shreyas Karanth is a Product Manager at Soroco. Soroco is a Medium-sized Enterprise-focussed B2B Automation company. Before Product Management, Shreyas was the fastest growing engineer - going from a fresh grad to a Technical Lead within 3 years of graduation.
This is also when I worked with him, during his engineering days. Here, I asked a bunch of questions why he moved to Product Management, what excites him and what he considers as Product Management work at Soroco.</description>

Here is what they did, organized by 5 themes:
  Unlock Knowledge
  Automate Boring Stuff
  Write Widely
  Solve Open Problems
  Outside-Visible Work
  Unlock Knowledge Expertise and know-how stay trapped in emails, docs and codebases. Unlock this for everyone else.

      <title>Fail Resume</title>

      <guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/failresume.html</guid>
      <description>A fail resume is, as its name suggests, a list of rejections and setbacks.
This concept originated in academia, but can be applied to improve one’s career, resilience, and approach to challenges in any walk of life.
I’ve organized my setbacks by year (starting with 2016), and what constitutes a “failure” (or fail) here is based solely on my own judgement. It’s important to not only list the failures, but also learn from them, so I will add reflections to some of them (in progress).</description>

      <description>I’d written originally this in August 2019 with a bit of foresight of a pending recession.
I wrote this primarily for myself. Multiple reviewers have mentioned that they found it immensely useful, so sharing it with you here!
Unfortunately, I didn’t follow some of the important notes here myself. Hope you do better than me!!!
Hard Assumptions   Recession will happen in the next 6-24 months
  Will hurt technology startup professionals which depend on VC money directly as pay cheques</description>

      <description>Don’t just network with people your own age Beware the whiz kid syndrome. Smart, young people have a habit of forming communities of other smart young people and feeding off each other’s energy. Argghhhh. Are you not just making mistakes made by older people again? Make original mistakes
Youth enclaves can actually be restrictive. In fact their networking should be about meeting useful mentors and career champions who can open doors and fast track careers.</description>

      <title>Thinking of Your Career as a Startup</title>
      <link>https://nirantk.com/writing/ruleof40.html</link>

      <guid>https://nirantk.com/writing/ruleof40.html</guid>
      <description>Broadly speaking, it’s useful to think of your career as a startup.
Your profit+growth percentage should be a minimum 40%
So say, you join a big company like Microsoft and your skills grow at 20% every year, while your pay only grows 10% - that&amp;rsquo;s bad.
You need to grow your skills and outcomes faster.
The other extreme is also fine: You join a small startup which can make great use of entrepreneurial DNA plus specific skills.</description>

  No one wishes that they’d accomplished less on their death beds. You might hear that no one wishes that they’d worked more. That’s right too.</description>

 Some ideas/papers/tools on monitoring models in production. A use case would be say a classification task over large inputs. I want to visualise how are the predicted values or even confidence scores vary over time? (paraphrased)

      <description>The Silent Rise of PyTorch Ecosystem While Tensorflow has made peace with Keras as it’s high level API and mxNet now support Gluon — PyTorch is the bare matrix love.
PyTorch has seen rapid adoption in academia and all the industrial labs that I have spoken to as well. One of the reasons people (specially engineers doing experiments) like PyTorch is the ease of debugging.
What I don’t like about PyTorch is it’s incessant requirement of debugging because of inconsistent dimensions problems.</description>

      <description>Why we need to do a reference check on startup teams we work with? Great Startups always ask someone who is joining for a reference check. They speak to your previous managers and colleagues. There is no reason why candidates should not do the same. Many startup employees have more opportunity costs than the founders themselves.
I&amp;rsquo;m surprised by the lack of due diligence which candidates do when interviewing with us.</description>

 One can have, it turns out, an affection for the war years.
 He was someone chasing something external: fame, glory, money or a version of these. Yet, in his dusk years — once he had achieved some of those, he valued his struggle more than his fame and glory.
For Steve, it was not about achieving these, it was, as I have come to call it: a good fight.</description>

 I guess there is a flavour of cheerful pragmatism that is uniquely BITSian. You can get ice cream and ice cream shakes anywhere - but Sharma’s MNB is uniquely BITSian.</description>
