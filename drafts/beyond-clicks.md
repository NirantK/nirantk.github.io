I should acknowledge that this second use case comes from something that impacts a lot more than logging:

1. We don't have an equivalent of "click" events in text or voice-first interfaces to represent user intent.
2. Text and voice take a lot of user effort -- the law of large numbers [^2] doesn't apply for most agents in production today. That means, I don't have a way to know if I am doing the right thing inside an agent loop.
