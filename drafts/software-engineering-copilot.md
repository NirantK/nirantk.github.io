I assume you've used Copilot. If not, you can read about it [here](https://copilot.github.com/). If you have, you'll know that it's a game changer. It's a game changer for software engineers, and it's a game changer for the software engineering industry.

## What is Github Copilot?

Github calls it's [Copilot](https://github.com/features/copilot) - "An AI Pair Programmer". But in the very next line, tone down your expecations: "suggest code and entire functions".

![Copilot Image goes here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NirantK/nirantk.github.io/9a439f2131dd6fa4e751a02537280e0aea6a8147/content/images/github-home-page-20230210.png)

It's not a pair programmer, it's auto complete for code. The premise being: It suggests code as you type, so you can focus on what you do best: solving problems.

But it's not the only one out there -- and some of them like [Tabnine](https://twitter.com/drorwe/status/1539293063117516801) claim to be as good and more feature-rich than Copilot.

So what's the big deal?

Well, it's Microsoft's distribution: Github Copilot is available to all Github users, works well with VS Code. It's free for open source contributors, and $10/mo for everyone else.

So for the rest of this post, I'll be talking about Copilot, but I think the same arguments apply to other similar products?

1. Github Copilot as a "Senior Intern"
2. Github Copilot as a librarian

## Copilot as a "Senior Intern"

Copilot is somewhere between a great docstring-to-function convertor and syntax auto-complete. If you've written a great docstring, Copilot will suggest a function that matches the docstring. If you've written a great function, Copilot will suggest a docstring that matches the function.

But it's not that hard to break it by simply asking for something Copilot has not seen often enough:

A. History of OpenAI
B. How Codex works

III. Benefits of Github Copilot

The advent of Github Copilot means that software engineers no longer need to spend time writing boilerplate code. Just as the advent of cameras made the painters who specialised in family portraits quite obsolete, Github Copilot takes care of the mundane coding tasks that aren't unique to a particular project or require a lot of creativity.

This frees software engineers to focus more on the creative and challenging aspects of their work.
