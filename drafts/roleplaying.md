This is going to be a long one. And it's a bit long winded, it's interesting - but it's also a bit boring for anyone skim reading. If you're looking for your next dopamine hit from finishing an essay - you're in the wrong place.

We'll talk a lot about the following:

1. Roleplaying
2. Parasocial Relationships
3. Cybernetic Implants
4. Proto Cyborgs

## Roleplaying

When [Baba Ranchoddas](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=flFTiOyrHlQ) had observed that the in any social setting, all you need is a "uniform" to be able to be a part of the group.

A set of rules that everyone must follow, depending on their role in the game.

Many of our experiences are surprisingly professional in that way - I don't employ "Mary" the person, I employ Mary the cook. Similarly, my clients do not hire "Nirant", but rather an high agency "engineer" called Nirant.

It's no surprise that when we hire, we often talk about "What is the role?". We don't ask "What is the job?", we ask "What is the role?".
We are admitting, even confessing, to ourselves and our players that we our work is theatre. We are not just doing the job but playing a role on the stage.

Samo Burja in his [How to Find Frontier's of Knowledge](https://medium.com/@samo.burja/how-to-find-the-frontiers-of-knowledge-ada58d0be155) talks more about how roles are necessar for professionalism:

> When I show up to Dr. Bob’s office, I don’t expect to deal with Bob; I expect to deal with The Doctor. The doctor is not going to behave as Bob, Alice, or Caroline might act, even if that’s who the doctor is. The doctor is going to behave as The Doctor! This is essentially a human user interface. I’m not Samo. I am The Patient. And Alice is The Doctor. Professionalism is a LARP—and an important one. It might seem as natural as gravity that there are doctors and patients, but these are social roles. And we had to be educated to fit those social roles.
