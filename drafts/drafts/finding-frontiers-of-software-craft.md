Like most of my essays, this essay is written for myself from few years ago.

Software Engineering, and it's cousins like Computer Science are unique. Unlike relatively mature domains of say, linear algebra - the field is still growing and not yet coherent. That makes it some what hard to study and _master_.

This also means we have a unique opportunity here. This makes it better to work in a field which is not yet c

But for those interested in pushing forward the frontiers of knowledge, it will sometimes be better to work in a field that has not yet cohered, or in a field on the cusp of crystallizing. 

Often the best intellectual opportunities — if you want to be a breakthrough researcher — and the largest economic opportunities — if you want to build a great company — are going to be precisely in those areas about to crystallize into a new field.

This is technology-career-centric riff on [How to Find Frontier of Knowledge](http://samoburja.com/how-to-find-the-frontier-of-knowledge/) mixed in with more context and examples. If you are into sociology or international politics, I recommend reading that essay by Samo Burja as well.
