Faux checkpoints, they don't give you anything. They're not impactful, but because they look good/easy to explain/convey - we intend to chase them.

When I was much younger, I mostly saw world and most things in binaries: success or failure. Then, I came to see how this always put me in a state of pre-success failure state. Because my brain would almost instantly go from achieving one checkpoint to seeing next level, and realising I'm not there yet. 

I learnt from Pressfield's writing the merits of taking your craft as supreme, what it means to be a _professional_, and the emotional-mental benefits of combining a blue collar work-ethic combined with an indomitable will.

I suspect if you're reading this, you already know what I'm talking about and are on this journey or have already done it.

This piece is about a hidden trap that I fell into, and I hope this warning will help you avoid it. 

The trap is **Inconsequential Success**.

What does this mean?
