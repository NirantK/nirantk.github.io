So I think my journey my journey started with Flipkart. That was a couple of years after I finished my undergrad at IIT. And at Flipkart, I spend close to six, six and a half years trying to build new businesses and figure out new markets for expansion. When I joined - Flipkart was just a bookseller, of course, had built a lot of e commerce technologies and the opportunity was ripe to build more categories. spend about six, six and a half years there building categories. And then when I when I decided to move on, even Mukesh was moving on. Mukesh had been in Flipkart for two and a half years after the Myntra merger, and he realized that there's an opportunity to do something really big in the healthcare space. Healthcare space, you know, is a very fragmented market, multiple categories, but all of them very small, very unbranded in nature and realize that there's a huge opportunity to create a multi-category platform,</p> <p>Ankit Nagori  1:02 that's how we did it.</p> <p>Nirant  1:06 Multi category platform, that's a very interesting way of looking at things, I think, HealthyifyMe and Cult are the only two things doing that right now. So why did you find this very interesting? </p> <p>Nirant  1:23 I think if you look at the overall, you know, health space or from a consumer point of view, to stay healthy. You really need to do multiple things you need to stay, you know, fit, mentally and physically, you need to eat healthy, you need to sleep well, you need to, you know, do your health checkup every year and do follow ups. So it is extremely difficult to stay healthy. And technology can definitely make it easier. And if you want to stay healthy, it has to be multiple categories, otherwise you just end up becoming a gym or health-food parlour or something. So we realize that the real value in long term - of course, it's very, very early days for us. But the real value in the long term will lie if we can own the end to end journey where a customer decides to stay healthy, and then she can really figure out the entire journey in over the few years few quarters across the board. So that's why you know, multi category is important. And while building a multi category platform, trying to make it easy is also very important. So we have tried to create products which are easy to consume, which are for starters for people who are not experts. And that's how we embarked on the journey.</p> <p>Nirant  2:34 And you chose to start with something like cult you could have started with something like care fit as well. </p> <p>Nirant  2:43 Yeah, Why?</p>"},{"location":"writing/ankitnagori/#go-to-market","title":"Go To Market","text":"<p>Started with the most consumerized and \"sticky\" habit: Gyms</p> <p>Ankit Nagori  2:45 I think the reason is very clear. If you look at the most consumerized product in healthcare right now, something which is very consumer focused, which is a very casual product, gyms is that category, because clinics and hospitals are very need based. People will do that when they have an acute need, of course. Healthcare and primary health care and secondary healthcare market is the largest. But fitness centers is something you know, which is the most consumerized product, more lifestyle product. And you know something which is an easy start, if you start doing a few classes every month, you will start the journey. And then of course, food is as important and the real problem in the country is that you don't have a very good supply of health food, you can't figure out what what can qualify as healthy food. And that's fair, I think food becomes extremely important as well. So these are the two categories where you've got massive scale. And of course, on top of that, we are building many, many more verticals which will build around food and fitness.</p> <p>Nirant  3:46 Okay, so now you mentioned cult.fit and eat.fit both cult has been amazing. You've built a community around it's word of mouth is insane, and how do you maintain it?</p>"},{"location":"writing/ankitnagori/#product-philosophy","title":"Product Philosophy","text":"<p>Every cult center is seen as a separate startup which needs to maintain 1000 true fans through out it's existence.</p> <p>Ankit Nagori  4:08 See, I think if you build any product, you need to start building a start, you start by just creating a very small community. And as a company, we follow a very strong philosophy around 1000 true fans, we feel that for any product to become successful, you need to get 1000 true fans, and true fans definitions, people are super duper users who will kill to use that product who would you know, be proponents, etc, etc. So that's exactly what we do. Whenever you open a cult center in a locality or a couple of other centers, we aim to get 1000 true fans in that locality. So when we launch a business, we do HSR, Sarjapur in Bangalore as a market and said that if we get 1000 true fans there, then we'll expand to Indiranagar and then again, and then we'll expand to Koramangala. So how we continue doing it is that because every time you open a new locality, we think of it as a new startup, and we say that 1000 people will not become crazy about the product, then there's no point. And that's a very strong thesis that we follow. And that has helped us reinvent the product. Every few quarters. That has helped us maintain the quality when we launch new cities, new markets. So that is the philosophy that we follow.</p> <p>Nirant  5:20 We have thousand true fans. The thesis, though works at like thousand feet level. When you said you iterate over this every few quarters, how does this each iteration look like? So I remember you had a very early center in Sarjapur for 2016/17. And my batchmate from college was like you should move to Sarjapur so that you can do cult, and that was very early in the cycle itself. So I'm assuming that now that this is probably like iteration 20 or something like that. What have these iterations look like?</p>"},{"location":"writing/ankitnagori/#role-of-technology","title":"Role of Technology","text":"<p>Building a customer journey across multiple touchpoints</p> <p>Ankit Nagaori  5:56 See, I think the first first important step we decided in 2016 was that the biggest problem that lies with the gyms is twofold: One, there is very little technology at the back end to manage the processes. And second, there is zero technology consumer facing. If you would go to even the top gyms in the US know Orangetheory, Barry's boot camp, very good product. But consumer journey is very weak. Consumers don't know how many classes. It's almost like a booking engine. Nothing like that of a journey tracker. So we realize that we need to build a journey product, where customers know how many classes they have done. They feel like doing more classes, they see progression. And they see other ancillary products getting tied up to it. So that's exactly what we have done. We have tried to create a product which is you know, a journey based product and a lot of technology. And if you are on a journey based product, people have done 100 classes in last one year to get them to another hundred classes this year -- You need to upgrade the product. And that's exactly what the philosophy is. You have to launch new formats. You have to launch new reasons for people to get excited. We're looking at hardware integration with the heartbeat, heart rate monitor in every class. We will be integrating a lot of technology through screens on the in the center. So I think the idea is to continuously evolve into a product which consumers are excited about. So we are very core value for us is blowing away customer expectations. But the tough part about customer expectation is that whatever was \"wow\" yesterday becomes table stakes today. So you have to continuously manage that every single day. So I think if you don't launch a new product every few quarters, which also get 1000 true fans really, then you will not continuously evolve. So every version of cult has to have 1000 true fans and not just the fact that at one point in time, every centre had that.</p> <p>Nirant  7:41 So what you're saying is it's not just 1000 true fans it's also novelty and pace, the pace of novelty itself.</p> <p>Ankit Nagori  7:48 Yes.</p> <p>Nirant  7:51 So, you mentioned the second thing which you mentioned was eat/eat.fit's menu has been very Indian/desi with roti, rice and sabji and you have not done any of the fancy Quinoa salads (I don't know how to pronounce).

So the interesting thing about food is food is something which people will not change their habit at all. It is the most intrinsic habit for a particular customer. If you look at how Indian palates work, there is a carb, there's a curry, and there's a protein. These are three things: dal-roti-paneer, dal-roti-chicken, chicken biryani, dosa, all of these are very standard thali format -- you need multiple variants. Indians are not used to, you know, a lot of single bowl salads etc. But if you also look at what our customers end up eating, if our target audiences, urban working people, right? They end up eating a lot of this food through cafeterias through ordering in, through fancy restaurants etc. The problem is that none of these are extremely healthy or extremely hygienic. So we said that if someone's going to collect all they need is a very basic healthy food, which is calorie counted. And the format has to be rice roti sabzi dal, you know, because that's what people eat 80% times. Pizza burger ko healthy banana is not the best idea because anyways, if people eating pizza and burgers once a week, let them cheat. Why do they need a you know, healthy pizza? Why do they need a, you know, brown bread burger or something like that, right? So it's better to just let them cheat, but when they're eating 80% of the meals It should be basic, healthy, hygienic, and calorie counted. Getting millions of people to change their daily habits is extremely tough, but giving them a slightly better version will work. And that's exactly the thesis that worked for us. We see the maximum demand during lunchtime, from corporates, which clearly still shows that people are looking for a healthier option than what they get at cafeterias and, you know, corporate catering. So I think that's the core insight. And about 50% of our customers end up using our eat fit menu very, very aggressively.</p>"},{"location":"writing/ankitnagori/#net-promoter-score","title":"Net Promoter Score","text":"<p>The glue that binds Cure Fit as a Team across Functions</p> <p>Nirant  10:36 Okay. And how does tracking flow back to how your decisions are made? Matlab every class you take an NPS score, how awesome it was or not. I remember early on 2019, I had marked one class was bad because I had an injury in the class. And I got a call back from cult? How are these processes built around NPS tracking?</p> <p>Ankit Nagori  11:06 Right? So if I look at, you know, the entire org, the entire orgs feature, features, sorry, the focus, even if you look at the entire odds focus, it is completely in the direction of making insanely great products and blowing up the customer expectation. Those are our core values. And one very interesting thing you know, because of technology integration at gyms and food is that we have a four point scale, after every interaction, you get a four point scale on rating the product on an experience, and anything which goes below four, which is three two and one, we start, you know, analyzing it. And the interesting thing is it's so real time that if there's a class in Bombay, where the speakers were not working, we'll start getting feedback like within 30 seconds of class getting over and then we'll know that something went wrong. We'll make sure that the speakers are fixed even before the next class starts. So, of course, it's very Uber like, you know, approach where they read their rides, e.g. customers. For us, it's extremely, extremely real time because customers immediately open the app again after the class to book the next class, they open the app to book their next meal, because of the daily transaction, multi multiple times a day, daily transaction nature, we get very many DLT feedback. So that goes back into all our our processes, all the new product development, all the performance management, incentives, etc, is all all tied back to the four point scale. So I think the biggest thing that keeps us together as a company is the four points rating scale. It is the biggest top of the mind metric and ask anyone, any trainer, what metric what the rating was for the last three days, they will know. Ask any chef, what was the rating for the kitchen last 3 days they would know. So I think this is a very, very important thing, which is, you know, created the entire journey around ratings and reviews.</p> <p>Niant  13:00 that is the Northstar metric in a manner of speaking? </p> <p>Ankit Nagori 13:05 Absolutely, absolutely.</p>"},{"location":"writing/ankitnagori/#hiring-and-organisation","title":"Hiring and Organisation","text":"<p>1 month Training Academy in Bengaluru and NCR for all Operations staff</p> <p>Nirant 13:10 Now that we've spoken about trainers and chefs, how do you hire people?

And second is the teams which are on the ground: running the center, running the kitchens, making the food, doing the classes. So for the first bucket, you know, we we have focus on campus recruitment and also, you know, from technology companies, ecommerce companies. So there we have a very good mix of experiences and very young folks with technology Product Marketing background. It's mostly inbound. We put out openings on LinkedIn, and networks. It's mostly inbound. We have an assimilation process where we meet them - the Candidates a few times. Look at the passion for Fitness, Sports and health, I think it's super important to have that passion to work for cure fit because it is a very difficult space. And if you yourself not a consumer of these products, then it'll be difficult to create these products. </p> <p>On the city teams and the operations team, which I mentioned. There we have, you know, boot camps, campus hiring, walk in drives, where we, you know, we figure out who we need to hire. And the most interesting aspect there is that after we hire these people, there is a one month training program. So we have training academy set up in Bangalore and NCR. It's a full classroom program, and anyone who hits the floor or the centers or anything, they have to go through a three to four weeks dedicated training, they have to clear a test and that helps us maintain quality.</p> <p>Nirant  14:51 So that's on ground ops teams. What do you look for when you hire in those roles? </p> <p>Ankit Nagori  15:00 think I think we look for you know, some basic intrinsics things of course, and these intrinsics are important because we need to know how it how it How well do they know the technology product? How do they How well do they stand their coaching, but how well you understand the food part. So some some understanding of technology, but very deep understanding of food or fitness in respective areas. And then we figure out how well we'll be able to transform their learning to the Cure Fit way of doing things. We have a particular philosophy of food we have a particular philosophy for doing fitness training. So I think openness to learning, overall knowledge base of health and fitness and food.

And how to maintain and retain these for both sides, both teams?</p> <p>Nirant  15:52 I think we realize that you know, the biggest way of retaining people is to continuously show them success. Showing success means really everyone making impact. So we are a very heavy, OKR driven company like most of the work gets done to objectives and key results framework. And we try and make sure that most people are seeing tangible progress in their journey. So I think that is one biggest engagement area. Second is we actually have a very strong culture of sports and fitness. And most of our engagement activities are actually built around that. I think that has helped us build a massive health and fitness culture and the camaraderie around it. So I think, overall, we feel that the whole health and fitness culture, which all the engagement activity is all there, all the traditions of the company have been around that. And lastly, the continuous success metric, which is success under the belt, OKRs are, I think, a very good way of making sure that people understand that they're making progress. If they look back six months in time, they know exactly what they've achieved and what could they have done better for the next six months.</p> <p>Nirant  17:00 Yeah, that's, that's interesting.

And there's been a lot of chatter about whether he's a good finisher or not, but if someone takes you so far, and still India does not and there have been many, many occasions in 90s &amp; 2000s where this happened, where you know, he would if he would take he would take the team to like last 10 runs and still not finish.

Yeah. So of course, both the Sapiens and Homo Deus. I think Sapiens and Dues have an interesting, you know, take at how things are.

My Experiments with Truth by Mothma Gandhi, I think it is a guide to most things in life. </p> <p>And from business point of view, I think I don't get heavily inspired by the book. I lead a lot of books, but I don't get extremely inspired by one book or the other either. I think Blitzscaling was the last book which I really liked.

I also argued that talent is the only form or advantage which I thought I could build to get material wealth in life.</p> <p>To me, the idea that Genius can be translated to material wealth is an axiomatic belief. So we\u2019ll not dwell on whether Genius is useful or not.</p> <p>In the late 2000s, a young man would show up every week with the same idea for approval from the management of this rapidly growing Internet startup. He had previously quit his job at an prestigious consulting company and closed those doors behind him by going to a smaller startup in a completely different role.</p> <p>For the idea which he had a lot of faith in, he was willing to bet this career and if not, at least his future prospects at that company. His bet? A new Internet explorer toolbar, which would ensure that users could find Google Search more easily and quickly. The man was Sundar Pichai.</p> <p>To many, that is and was a move of genius. This was a genius of not just invention, but also business, technology and user psychology. There is more than one flavour of genius for sure.</p> <p>Let\u2019s begin by understanding what we mean by genius first.</p> <p>Our cultural understanding of intellectual excellence, or more popularly, genius is extremely limited \u2013 and dare I say, harmful. We limit these to inventors, mathematical prodigies and their ilk.</p> <p>Alexey Guzey talks about this cultural misunderstanding here: https://guzey.com/intelligence-killed-genius/</p> <p>I know a few people who I believe to be geniuses. What happens when I tell them that I believe they\u2019re a genius? They all tell me that there are people smarter than them and that they\u2019re \u201conly pretty good at one or two things\u201d</p> <p>bitch this is exactly what genius is.</p> <p>Genius isn\u2019t limited to the ability to solve puzzles, or do rapid arithmetic, or Sheldon\u2019s eccentric quirks.</p> <p>Genius is having the ability, no \u2013 the advantage, to see things which others can\u2019t see.</p> <p>To me, as someone of not-superhuman intelligence, the question is this then:</p> <p>\u201cHow do I make the leap from Talent to Genius?\u201d</p> <p>The answer is in the Alexey Guzey essay itself: genius is having a vision.</p> <p>In sports, the line between talent and genius is often blurred. Is Michael Jordan a really talented player, or a genius for exploiting the blind spots of referees to his advantage?</p> <p>It\u2019s being able to make bets and act on them with unparalleled insight. It\u2019s executing. It\u2019s doing something which escapes the imagination of most people in the know. It\u2019s a taste for what could work, without being bound by tradition.</p> <p>As Arthur Schopenhauer summarized: Talent hits a target no one else can hit; Genius hits a target no one else can see.</p>"},{"location":"writing/belief_arbitrage/#part-3-courage","title":"Part 3: Courage","text":"<p>We touched upon a question of interest to us:</p> <p>\u201cHow do I make the leap from Talent to Genius?\u201d</p> <p>I don\u2019t have a complete answer yet. So let me offer the part of the puzzle which I am very confident about: Courage.</p> <p>It\u2019s a key ingredient, a necessary catalyst for one to make the leap from one to another.</p> <p>A natural question follows, what do we mean by courage? How do you recognize courage?</p> <p>Of course, there is the Die Hard version of running into a gun nest. That is a subset of courage.</p> <p>Courage also has some other flavors. Many of us recognize them almost instantly in the form of honor and duty.</p> <p>The other smell for spotting courage is the acting on something despite fear and/or knowledge of harsh consequences. Many outsized entrepreneurial and military ventures are built with this courage.</p> <p>There is also a lot of courage which stems from not caring about what people have to say. To neither be bound by shackles of history or tradition, but also respect Chesterton\u2019s Fence.</p> <p>It frees you to learn about reality from other people, but not be bound to the reality of today. An ability to envision a future state which others don\u2019t imagine. </p> <p>Pressfield\u2019s Resistance is the most dangerous element to one's life and dreams since its sole mission is to sabotage aspirations. The first step to fighting Resistance is knowing that you can, and you can win a battle here and another there. </p> <p>That is empowering you to action. That is a form of courage. </p> <p>It frees you to make bets that\u2019d make others shiver in fear of uncertainty. It frees you to act in ways congruent to your values and aspirations. To seek truth, beauty and craft above all else.</p> <p>For a craftsman mindset, to do their best work, the ideal state is where they can act freely. For that specific form of high agency, courage is a key ingredient, a catalyst. Without courage, no talent can truly do their best work. The leap is impossible from Talent to Genius. </p> <p>Courage in any flavor: pride, duty, honor, self-confidence is a foundational belief. </p> <p>This is a belief that not only is something achievable - but there might be a means and methods to do so. It is a specific form of Arbitrage against Reality. An advantage which you, my dear talented friend, now have over others that don\u2019t have the conviction, or the courage.</p>"},{"location":"writing/beyond-basic-rag/","title":"Beyond Basic RAG: What You Need to Know","text":"<p>The Real World of RAG Systems</p> <p>\ud83d\udcd2 Picture this: You're a developer who just deployed your first RAG system.

I've taken the liberty to remove our internal slang and some boring stuff.</p> <p>I want to build a community around me on NLP. How can I get discovered by others?</p> <p>Broadly speaking, the aim in forming connections can be split into Long Term and Short term. A short term aim would be where you can receive something immediate out of the connections or a particular connection itself. This could be a collaboration, correspondence, recommendation/advice or anything else.</p> <p>A more long-term, strategic aim would be a well defined long term goal that requires multiple steps to achieve. A strategic aim could involve multiple tactical steps. This is also, what we like to call friendship in some polite-speak areas of the world. </p> <p>I have no immediate goals or projects, just need some basic ideas on how to be a part of the ML community.</p> <p>Find interests of people and do something for them. Many people simply ask questions on Twitter, or you can infer what they are interested in looking at their Linkedin/work and their personal blogs. </p> <p>What would be a good starting point for this?</p> <p>A very easy thing to start with is literature review. Specially, for new topics being researched by influential people in the field. A good literature review shows your interest and willingness to help. Opens door to communication.</p> <p>A good place to find what topics are missing a decent literature review:  Go through NLP reddit r/LanguageTechnology or subreddits for Deep Learning, Machine Learning and so on. </p> <p>Or go through twitter. And help people out there. Answer their question with depth. Do not rush to be the first, but the best. When it comes to technology, almost all platforms behave a bit like StackOverflow, the right answer might not get accepted: but it'll get noticed. Btw, lot of the Huggingface contributors happen to be active on Github and Twitter both. Hanging around on their Slack can't hurt either. </p> <p>But important thing, try and stick to one medium. The place where you are most at home and gels with your personality. This could actually even be Youtube if you're an English-fluent, attractive looking person. </p> <p>The other reason you need to stick to one medium is that audience will spend most of their time on 1 or 2 social media channels. </p> <p>If they see that your content is not that popular on the other channel - They will do the cross posting for you. For instance, we've both seen Twitter content even within ML such as the Gary Marcus debate and attack on Yann LeCun spill over on reddit. And of course, people are still posting Tweets on TikTok!</p> <p>Word of mouth will be your biggest friend.</p> <p>Find problems that many people face. Usually a simple problem faced by many is a great problem statement. The python <code>requests</code> library comes to my mind as an excellent example of such a challenge. The work by <code>gensim</code> around shallow vectorization methods like word2vec and Glove was also quite similar in vein for quite a lot of time. Of course, with the rise of Deep Learning and better tooling makes their work less important - but they stuck in my mind, didn't they?</p> <p>Why is that a great problem statement?</p> <p>It's maximising the area under the curve. Solve a trivial problem faced by many or a huge problem faced by some. It has the same impact.</p> <p>What's something that has worked for you in finding interesting problems?</p> <p>Find intersections with domains that have little to do with each other. For us, there are domains that have little to do with tech/code and can see great benefits from our involvement.</p> <p>Marketing yourself has nothing to do with marketing but everything to do with the problems you solve and the solutions you come up with. Make sure the solution is accessible to the wider audience. It should not be that only a certain section of the population can use it. If you plan to market yourself, spend 95% of the time on a quality problem and a quality solution and 5% of time talking about it. This is usually enough if the first 95% is done well.</p> <p>What medium to talk about these in?</p> <p>The usual are the blog posts or social media posts etc. But there is an open secret within the community. Writing papers is probably the best way to talk about stuff you\u2019ve done.</p> <p>Why so?</p> <p>Papers have the halo effect. It improves your reputation and makes it sticky. People might forget a blog post quickly but you can get recognition/perks for around 2 years or so after writing a paper. There are other secondary gains too from doing this. Once you write a paper, you start reading papers differently. You have a better intuition of reading between the lines to understand the author\u2019s intent/pov. Another obvious benefit is you get better at writing papers. Your thought process will start coming across much more clearly.</p>"},{"location":"writing/building-a-data-science-team/","title":"Building a Data Science Team at a Startup","text":"<p>Hello! </p> <p>If we are meeting for the first time, a short version of my story so far: After doing research engineering for almost 4 years across startups and a BigCo, I joined as an early machine learning engineer at Verloop.io - a B2B startup that makes customer support automation SaaS in 2019.

It\u2019s not competing with OTel \u2014 it\u2019s extending it into a new domain.</p> <p>So when I read the recent Signoz essay arguing that \"OTel is enough for LLM observability\" I disagreed \u2014 not because OTel is wrong, but because the framing misses what's fundamentally new about GenAI workloads.</p> <p>OpenInference is an enriched version of OTel built specifically for LLMs. It offers more specific span types for LLMs, including LLM, tool, and agent. It is first and foremost built for developers to use in their own LLM-powered applications, where they want to log LLM choices and actions. OpenInference was designed to be complementary to OpenTelemetry GenAI <sup>4</sup>, not an alternative. It already provides OTel-friendly instrumentations and semantic conventions.</p> <p>As an example, the metrics which OpenInference takes seriously are: Token usage, cost per request, time to first token, tool call rates. And the original OTel cares about the RED metrics <sup>3</sup> e.g. latency, error rates, and throughput.</p> <p>Signoz is not alone in making a case for OTel against OpenInference.

Embedded within Business &amp; Product Teams","text":"<p>By far the most popular org design in Indian startups, is a Data Scientist is embedded into an engineering team along with an analyst which is then assigned to a business or product team. From the top of my head, this is how some of the best Data Science teams like AirBnb, Flipkart, and Facebook organize their ML teams. </p> <p>I strongly considered this org design, but ultimately opted against this because it would not play to my strengths at all. </p> <p>I expected these challenges:</p> <ol> <li>Hard to maintain uniform data and engineering standards across the org</li> </ol> <p>In this org structure, the primary, and sometimes only stakeholder for each Data person is their Product manager. There is a lot of work which is repeated e.g. data pipelines, cleaning, pre-processing. The larger organisations enforce some degree of uniformity via their Data Platforms or equivalent. In the early stages, this effort is not worth the decoupling speed.</p> <ol> <li>Management Complexity, in terms of the ever increasing breadth of problems across different features</li> </ol> <p>In the embedded space, each team could itself be working on a wide variety of \u201csmall\u201d ML problems e.g. demand forecasting, text embedding, and sentiment analysis could be all worked on by a single Data Scientist. </p> <p>Since the Product Manager doesn\u2019t have the technical skill to evaluate whether the solution approach was apt or not, it falls on the Data Science Manager to have a lot of breadth and assist several IC Data Scientists across multiple problems at the same time.</p>"},{"location":"writing/data-science-org-design/#3-data-science-consultant","title":"3.

[Near Future] Productized Data Science Team","text":"<p>When I studied more modern teams, especially in B2B SaaS or eCommerce from outside, I felt they made a small but important change in this model: Instead of a matrix where the Data Scientist was ultimately responsible to their own product/pod and nothing else, they had a central Data Science function to which all Data Scientists reported.</p> <p>Some teams created a new, \"Chief Data Scientist\" or \"VP, Machine Learning\" designations to reflect this increased autonomy and status within the org. Notice that this is quite similar to how some Design teams are organized.</p> <p>While I had not worked under this org design, I had interned at a place which was small (10-50 employees) and I could understand the limitations of this org design when I was told the same.</p> <p>The most common warning was the amount of context which any lead/manager Data Science had to keep beyond a certain project count within the company. I expect that the Verloop.io ML Team will evolve into this over the next 12-24 months. I'm estimating this on the basis of the problem complexity and the headcount needed for engineering and data science teams both. If we can have ICs reporting to both the Product Manager and a Data Science org, the added management complexity would be worth it in the faster shipping speed via shared tooling and context. </p>"},{"location":"writing/data-science-org-design/#5-verloop-today-full-stack-data-science","title":"5.

Rather, the goal is to learn and develop new business capabilities. \u2026 There are no blueprints; these are new capabilities with inherent uncertainty. \u2026 All the elements you\u2019ll need must be learned through experimentation, trial and error, and iteration. \u2013 Eric Colson</p> <p>As Eric calls out, Data Science, unlike say Platform Engineering functions - is not a pure \"execution\" function.

If you\u2019ve seen them in the past, now we both have a shared vocabulary to talk about it. </p> <p>As a case study, let me share some of the operational things we had at Verloop.io. This was mostly as part of our 0 to 1 journey as a B2B SaaS product. </p> <p>These are not recommendations, but just how things shaped up in the early days. I hope this gives you a case study to concretely think about what we just discussed. </p> <ol> <li>ML function reported directly to the CEO for the longest time. The CEO directly brings the business context and drives quick wins. The ML Lead needs to negotiate continuously on organisational goals, constantly query for added context, and make long term bets.</li> </ol> <p>Part of the ML Product Manager role also got absorbed into what I'd been doing as a Machine Learning Lead/Manager because we did not have a full time Product Manager in the company for more than 6 months.</p> <ol> <li>Attracting young talent was easier by giving them quite high autonomy. The team also owns model performance and deployment.</li> </ol> <p>The deployment ownership is made possible by a ML System Design decision as well. The strong adherence to multi-tenant models instead of client specific models.</p> <ol> <li>Talent pool is smaller + retention is hard</li> </ol> <p>We had a smaller talent pool for at least 2 reasons: A few data science candidates refused to join the team because they were not interested in engineering, and wanted to focus on modeling tasks exclusively. </p> <p>In some other cases, the conversation broke down because we couldn\u2019t match their pay expectations. </p> <p>We managed to make our retention hard because of good intentions, but with bad outcomes: </p> <p>The engineering org in our early stages did a lot of ad hoc development in smaller, demo-driven sprint cycles. We assumed that separating ML from the rest of the engineering org would allow us to ship faster. It would also allow us to focus longer on one project, without being distracted by ad hoc tasks. This did work to a certain extent.</p> <p>In hindsight, this was a mistake. It definitely empowered us to ship faster, but teammates felt isolated, and it was hard to complete the feedback loop with our end users via the Product Manager alone. Additionally, if we needed engineering\u2019s help to ship something, they\u2019d pick \u201ctheir\u201d work over integrating our shipped work. This slowed down our shipping pace itself over a longer duration. This in turn, hurt the morale of the team, and made retention much harder. </p> <p>I\u2019d do this differently the next time around.</p> <p>There are 3 things I\u2019d do differently:</p> <ol> <li>Remove the middleman (i.e me): PM and the Data Scientist should work directly with each other. Instead of the information flowing/gathered with me as the nodal person.</li> <li>Better Retrospectives: We did a few reviews i.e. what went well or wrong, but not enough of \u201cHow does this inform our future?\u201d</li> <li>Add Front End, DevOps Skills: Lot of our releases would reach the end user because the interface was designed, but not implemented. Engineering teams would quite obviously pick their own OKRs above ours. The short term fix is to add Front End and DevOps skills.</li> </ol> <p>Even something as simple as being able to build+deploy Gradio or Streamlit demos would go a long way in convincing the org to prioritise the shipped work.</p>"},{"location":"writing/data-science-org-design/#ending-note","title":"Ending Note","text":"<p>The terms are borrowed from the amazing blog by Pardis Noorzad: Models for integrating data science teams within companies | by Pardis Noorzad | Medium</p> <p>Thanks to Eugene Yan and Maneesh Mishra for taking the time to review this piece.

artificial intelligence \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948?\nOkay, the user is asking me to explain what artificial intelligence is. Let's start by breaking down the term. \"Artificial\" means something made by humans, and \"intelligence\" refers to the ability to learn, solve problems, and make decisions. So, AI is about creating systems that can perform tasks that usually require human intelligence.\n\nI should mention that AI isn't just about robots; it's more about software and algorithms. Maybe give some examples they might be familiar with, like Siri or Alexa. Those are examples of AI applications. Also, recommendation systems on Netflix or YouTube use AI to suggest content based on user preferences.\n\nI need to explain the different types of AI. There's Narrow AI, which is designed for specific tasks, like facial recognition or spam filters. Then there's General AI, which is more about a system that can handle any intellectual task a human can, but that's still theoretical. Maybe clarify that most AI today is Narrow AI.\n\nMachine learning is a subset of AI, right? So, I should mention that. ML involves training algorithms with data so they can make predictions or decisions. Deep learning is a part of ML using neural networks. Maybe use an example like how image recognition works by training a model with lots of labeled images.\n\nApplications are important to make it concrete. Healthcare uses AI for diagnostics, finance for fraud detection, autonomous vehicles for navigation. Also, mention chatbots, since they interact with them.\n\nEthical considerations are crucial too. Issues like bias in AI systems if the training data is biased. Privacy concerns with data collection. Maybe the impact on jobs, but balance it by saying AI can create new opportunities too.\n\nFinally, summarize the key points: AI is human-made intelligence, uses algorithms and data, has various types and applications, and comes with challenges. Keep the explanation simple and relatable without too much jargon.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"writing/deepseek-for-india/#do-llms-speak-bollywood","title":"Do LLMs speak Bollywood?","text":"<p>Next, I tried asking a question in pure Hindi which refers a pre-Internet Bollywood movie: </p> <p>Question: </p> <p>\u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u092c\u0902\u0917\u0932\u093e \u0939\u0948, \u0917\u093e\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0939\u0948, \u0926\u094c\u0932\u0924 \u0939\u0948\u0964  \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948? </p> <p>Answer: </p> <p>ChatGPT has a perfect answer: </p> <p></p> <p>DeepSeek R1 has no clue: </p> <p></p> <p>But the thinking process is very interesting: </p> <pre><code>Okay, let's look at the user's query. They wrote in Hindi: \"\u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u092c\u0902\u0917\u0932\u093e \u0939\u0948, \u0917\u093e\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0939\u0948, \u0926\u094c\u0932\u0924 \u0939\u0948\u0964 \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u0915\u094d\u092f\u093e \u0939\u0948?\" which translates to \"I have a bungalow, a car, wealth. What do you have?\"\n\nFirst, I need to understand the context here. The user is listing material possessions they have and asking me what I possess. Since I'm an AI, I don't own physical things. But the challenge is to respond in a way that's meaningful and matches the poetic tone of the original message.\n\nThe original lines have a rhythmic structure. The response should ideally mirror that structure. The user's lines end with \"\u0939\u0948\" (hai - have) each time, so the response should follow a similar pattern but with different verbs that reflect non-material qualities.\n\nI need to convey that while I don't have physical items, I possess knowledge, support, and readiness to help. Using verbs like \"\u0939\u0948\" won't fit here. Instead, verbs like \"\u0938\u093e\u0925\" (sath - with) or \"\u092e\u0926\u0926\" (madad - help) might work better. Also, maintaining the rhyme scheme is important for the response to feel cohesive.\n\nLooking at the example response provided by the assistant earlier: \"\u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948, \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0939\u0948, \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0926\u0926 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0930\u093e\u0939\u0924 \u0939\u0948\u0964\" It uses \"\u0939\u0948\" again, which keeps the structure similar. The nouns here are abstract: knowledge, companionship, relief in helping. That's a good approach.\n\nI should check if the verbs and nouns are correctly conjugated. \"\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0924 \u0939\u0948\" (relief is) might not be the most accurate. Maybe \"\u0924\u0924\u094d\u092a\u0930\u0924\u093e\" (readiness) instead of \"\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0924\" could be better. So, \"\u092e\u0926\u0926 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0924\u094d\u092a\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\" (readiness to help). That flows well.\n\nAlso, considering the meter, each line should have a similar number of syllables. Let's count:\n\nOriginal: \"\u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u092c\u0902\u0917\u0932\u093e \u0939\u0948, \u0917\u093e\u0921\u093c\u0940 \u0939\u0948, \u0926\u094c\u0932\u0924 \u0939\u0948\u0964\" Each part is 4-2, 3-2, 3-2 syllables. The response should match that. \"\u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948, \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0939\u0948, \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0926\u0926 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0924\u094d\u092a\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964\" Breaking it down: \"\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948\" (2-2), \"\u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0939\u0948\" (2-2), \"\u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0926\u0926 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0924\u094d\u092a\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\" (tumhaari madad karne ki tatpartaa hai) which is 9-2. That's longer.

Better.\n\nSo the revised response would be: \"\u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948, \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0939\u0948, \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0926\u0926 \u0915\u0940 \u0924\u0924\u094d\u092a\u0930\u0924\u093e \u0939\u0948\u0964\" This keeps the structure closer to the original while conveying the intended meaning.\n\nAlternatively, using \"\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0924\" as before: \"\u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0926\u0926 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0930\u093e\u0939\u0924 \u0939\u0948\" might be more poetic, even if \"\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0924\" (relief) is a bit less precise. The key is to maintain the rhythm and rhyme.\n\nAnother angle: The user is focusing on material things, so the response could highlight intangible but valuable qualities. Words like \"\u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928\" (knowledge), \"\u0938\u093e\u0925\" (companionship), and \"\u0938\u092e\u0930\u094d\u092a\u0923\" (dedication) could work. For example: \"\u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948, \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0939\u0948, \u0938\u0947\u0935\u093e \u0915\u093e \u0938\u092e\u0930\u094d\u092a\u0923 \u0939\u0948\u0964\" (I have knowledge, companionship, dedication to serve.)\n\nBut the original example used \"\u0930\u093e\u0939\u0924 \u0939\u0948\", which is more about the relief in helping. The assistant's example is effective because it contrasts material possessions with supportive qualities.\n\nI think sticking close to the example provided is best, as it already maintains the poetic structure and effectively contrasts materialism with supportive intangibles. So the final response would be as given: \"\u092e\u0947\u0930\u0947 \u092a\u093e\u0938 \u091c\u094d\u091e\u093e\u0928 \u0939\u0948, \u0938\u093e\u0925 \u0939\u0948, \u0924\u0941\u092e\u094d\u0939\u093e\u0930\u0940 \u092e\u0926\u0926 \u0915\u0930\u0928\u0947 \u0915\u0940 \u0930\u093e\u0939\u0924 \u0939\u0948\u0964\"\n</code></pre> <p>Here is the broad chain-of-thought: </p> <ol> <li>English Translation</li> <li>Hindi Translation</li> <li>Poetic Structure</li> <li>Verbs and Nouns</li> <li>Rhyme Scheme</li> <li>Final Response</li> </ol> <p>This is quite interesting and would indicate that the model has \"learnt\" to notice poetry and do translation when spoken to in languages other than English and Chinese. </p> <p>I am not sure if this is a good thing or a bad thing.

Here are the 3 most significant technological implications:</p> <ol> <li> <p>Open Source Innovation in Reasoning: The R1 model stands as the first open source system to show reasoning chains.  The reasoning chains being open source means that almost everyone can make their own reasoning model now without being blocked on OpenAI or Anthropic to expose those. This mirrors Claude and Llama 3's impact from a year ago, which showed the possibility of building competitive models, but R1 takes this further by achieving state of the art performance without requiring original training data. </p> </li> <li> <p>Synthetic Data Revolution: The model's training approach relies on self-generated data, requiring minimal human input and eliminating the need for manual data tagging. While DeepSeek V3 used human-tagged data as a foundation, R1's reinforcement learning phase operates entirely on synthetic data. This represents the first publicly documented instance of achieving state-of-the-art performance using primarily synthetic data, breaking through the traditional bottleneck of human data labeling. This basically means that LLMs are now truly unblocked on human intelligence to get smarter. This is the opening of Pandora's box, which people have been talking about since 2012. </p> </li> <li> <p>Better Reinforcement Learning: The reinforcement learning methodology is a shift from conventional approaches. While the major American AI labs, including OpenAI, use complex, potentially unstable methods requiring extensive experimentation, DeepSeek's approach employs a more straightforward ranking-based methodology. This simplification, while still maintaining high performance, challenges existing assumptions about necessary complexity in AI development.</p> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"writing/r1-for-non-technical-audience/#example-grpo-with-multiple-chains-of-thought","title":"Example: GRPO with Multiple Chains of Thought","text":"<p>GRPO stands for Group Reward Policy Optimization.

Here\u2019s how you start:</p> </li> <li> <p>Read the title and abstract.\u00a0This might seem obvious, but authors do put in the effort to compress their key ideas, findings or contributions in these places. This effect is even more amplified since these are the most important fields on arXiv. If you spend a minute of full attention, you should get a feel for the intent and scope of the work. This will not only prime you for what you might be reading next, but also mentally map this work to ideas which you might be already familiar with.</p> </li> <li> <p>Skim the Section Headings, which will give you a feel for organization of the paper. Is the paper emphasizing datasets? A new architecture? Or an empirical work which is basically throwing compute and sharing that \"See, It works!\". I am always a little annoyed when I am discussing a paper when it turns out that the reader has not even got the intent of why the paper sections are organized in a specific way. Obviously, many conferences have specific templates which make it even easier to discover the structure which the authors actually wanted you to pay attention to.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Get a sense of the context\u00a0This means skimming the Related Work section. The intent isn't to read every paper or idea mentioned in this section, but only the topics mentioned here. This will help you get a sense of the jargon used, the variety of topics and what the authors consider adjacent problems/areas. </p> </li> <li> <p>Read the Conclusion.\u00a0Authors generally do a good job summarizing their work in the last few pages. This where they sum up what they think is most important about their work. Just jump to this first.</p> </li> </ul> <p>\ud83d\udca1Pro Tip\ud83d\udca1: Check out their interview, podcast, oral presentation, or Twitter thread or poster.\u00a0While this has nothing to do with the actual paper, these can be a great way to get the gist of a paper in 30 minutes or so.

If there is a math formula, concept, or word you don\u2019t know, first look at the context to try to discern its meaning. See if the author explains what happens when or why they used it. Warm up and use your brain to get started. If it\u2019s something you simply can\u2019t get past, or the word is clearly too important for you to glance over, then check the citations.

To be able to answer these questions shows that you have at least some understanding of the paper and what you've read. If you can\u2019t answer them, you probably haven\u2019t quite paid attention well enough. I also find it personally helpful that you should actually write (or type) these answers out. Consider it to be like a book journal. It\u2019ll stay with you and become much more ingrained than if you just answer them in your head. </li> </ul> <p>What is the paper about, as a whole? This is essentially the abstract or conclusion. You could cheat, but that's not going to be very helpful. Instead use your own words and write a the highlights of what you can recall about the paper. See if you can connect it to the wider knowledge base which you've read in the past.</p> <p>What is being said in detail, and how?\u00a0This is where you start to dig a little deeper. Briefly go back and skim through the paper, jogging your memory of the key points, formulae, section headings, graphs and tables with results. With most papers, outlining is pretty straightforward since the section headings do bulk of the job for you. For short papers, this could be as short as 5-10 lines. Pay special attention to what datasets, experiment configurations and ablation results if they're mentioned.</p> <p>Is the paper true - in whole or in part? If you're reading within your own comfort zone, you'll begin to see by now the scenarios/tasks/areas where the paper falls short. For instance, if you're reading up on Long Range Transformers -- based on your knowledge of pre-trained Transformer models like BERT, RoBERTa or T5, you should expect them do better at summarization and Q&amp;A tasks than these. If the paper falls short, you can quickly jot that down as a question to ask, ponder upon or experiment yourself. This is true for both peer-reviewed and pre-print papers - they can often have glaring errors and mistakes which you might notice.  </p> <p>So what? What\u2019s the significance? Most papers are incremental in their contribution to the world. This is not necessarily a bad thing. As long as the paper made you see the field or area in a new light, or even a new nugget of knowledge - it was helpful. We should aim for reading papers which at-least give us something valuable in either perspective, knowledge (e.g. empirical facts) or methods. This is by far the most useful question to ask since it helps contextualize the contributions of the author against your own personal context, understanding and knowledge.</p> <p>The core idea here is that reading is not a passive process. You have to actively engage with the text and think about what you read. It's natural to just scan over the text without actually retaining anything. To counteract this, you need to make a conscious effort to stop and think about what the author is saying. A good way of doing this is to write down a list of questions about what the author says. This will force you to stop and think about the content. When answering these questions, you need to write them in your own words. This means that you can't just parrot the authors words back at them. Instead, you need to rephrase the question in your own words. This will help you engage with the ideas in a more meaningful way.</p> <p>\ud83d\udca1Pro Tip\ud83d\udca1: Generate questions about the content of the reading. For example, convert headings and sub-headings into questions, and then look for answers in the content of the text. Other more general questions may also be formulated:    - What is this paper about?    - What question is this section trying to answer?    - How does this information help me?</p> <p>Optional, critique and share your thoughts with others.\u00a0This step is dead last. Only after having read the entire paper, or sets of papers, and thoughtfully answering the 4 Key Questions can you critique or have meaningful discussions about the paper.     - For starters, a reasonable critique asks more questions (\"Did they assume X?\", \"What would happen if I replaced method M1 with M3?\") than it makes verdicts (\"The paper is amazing\", \"This is stupid\").     - The second point is to fight the temptation to write a paper summary instead of a critique. That's the fad these days but isn't quite meaningful enough. You writing a measly, annoying Medium blog might feel like an achievement to yourself (thanks to cheap applause) but doesn't improve your understanding as much as writing a critique will.             - Also, you don't have to take everything that the authors claim as God's Gospel. Having a disagreement is completely fine and valid. But give them the benefit of doubt and ask questions instead of making assumptions. It goes without saying, that you don't have to disagree or agree with every part of the paper. You can freely completely love one part and ignore the rest. There is no need (or advantage) to have an opinion about everything.</p> <p>\ud83d\udca1Pro Tip\ud83d\udca1: You can use the Question Generation idea even during \"Intelligently Skimming\", especially for topics where you're comfortable. This will save you a lot of time and energy during Analytical Reading.</p> <p>Syntopical \u2014 This is mostly used by researchers and professors. It\u2019s where you read multiple papers on a single subject and form a thesis or original thought by comparing and contrasting various other authors\u2019 thoughts.

I am not the author of this post. I'm archiving it here since the original source is no longer available.</p> <p>I've taken the liberty to copy paste the raw text:</p> <p>Given my journey, you can imagine my first reaction to questions of work-life balance is fairly unsympathetic. I want to protest that, by legitimizing such a false dichotomy, you\u2019re pre-empting a much more meaningful conversation. But I suspect that conversation is closer to the heart of this anxiety than most people realize. </p> <p>If you\u2019re worrying about work-life balance at the beginning of your career, and you\u2019re reading this, I\u2019m guessing you\u2019re not lazy. You\u2019re not looking for an easy life (even if this seems like an appealing concept right after midterms). I\u2019m willing to bet that what you\u2019re really worried about is someone else owning your most precious possession: your future. </p> <p>Staring into the abyss of companies that glorify triple-digit hours (never mind the substance of the work), this makes intuitive sense. But having surveyed the landscape of high-tech hiring, I\u2019m convinced you should be just as concerned about jobs that promise high stimulation and total comfort. When you let yourself be sold on easy hours, outrageous perks, and glib assurances about the project you\u2019ll join and the technologies you\u2019ll get to play with, you\u2019ve just agreed to let your future become someone else\u2019s.</p> <p>I hate the construct of work-life balance for the same reason I love engineering: the reality is dynamic and generative, not zero-sum. It\u2019s about transcending the constraints of simplistic calculations. Creating the life and the work you want are by no means easy challenges, but they are absolutely attainable. What\u2019s not realistic is thinking you can own your future and be comfortable at the same time. Grit, not virtuosity, will be the biggest determinant of your success, for reasons I\u2019ll explore in a bit. </p> <p>At the same time, grit and discipline aren\u2019t enough. You need purpose. And I can state categorically that the purpose you discover, with all the sacrifice that entails, will be more motivating and meaningful than the one handed to you in the form of some glamorous project that, realistically, will succeed or fail regardless of your involvement. </p> <p>The catch, of course, is that true purpose doesn\u2019t sit around waiting to be discovered. It requires constant pursuit. Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve learned from a decade and a half of sprinting.</p> <p>There\u2019s no time like now. As learning animals, we\u2019re subject to various ages of cognitive potency. As a young child, your aptitude for acquiring a language or learning an instrument is at its peak. Accordingly, as a professional, your early 20s are the most formative stage. It is absolutely critical to make the most of this time because the pace of learning grows slower and more incremental as you age, whether we care to admit it or not. Of course, you can always learn new things, but most often the wisdom of experience is largely the result of earlier realizations having the time to compound into something richer.</p> <p>The place of maximal learning is often at the point of significant pain. It\u2019s not just about having a more pliable mind - grit, and its close cousin, resilience, are essential for taking your intelligence further than it can get on its own. And while intelligence compounds, grit degrades in the vast majority of cases. Regardless, grit isn\u2019t something you can suddenly develop after a life of leisure. For these reasons, owning your future means choosing grit over the allure of a predictable pace.</p> <p>Of course, you still need to hold a pace. Studies show that marathoners/endurance runners do tons of self-talk to push past the pain. \u201cIt\u2019s a marathon, not a sprint\u201d is a well-worn clich\u00e9, but it\u2019s striking how often it\u2019s invoked to rationalize comfort as opposed to promoting sustained excellence. Don\u2019t think for a second that elite marathoners have trained to the point that a sub-six-minute mile pace is comfortable. It\u2019s incredibly painful. What separates the truly elite is having found a purpose that makes the sacrifice acceptable.</p> <p>At the same time, complete self-motivation is incredibly rare. It\u2019s probably not a realistic goal, and that\u2019s fine. Find the people who will sharpen your resolve as well as your ideas. Again, your first step matters. If you choose a job for work-life balance, chances are, so did everyone who came before. Talent is one thing when evaluating your future teammates, but ask yourself this: when you need models and inspiration to be more than you are, will you be able to find them?  Where will your gamma radiation come from?</p> <p>You can find your zen in stressful, chaotic times. In fact, I\u2019d argue this is the norm, even the ideal, for 20-somethings. Some adrenaline is good for your performance. Not having time to waste requires you to focus on the essentials and develop an innate sense of direction. That way, when you do eventually get to let your mind wander, it will be in rewarding directions. These days, I build in calendar blocks for \u201cbrain space\u201d. That wouldn\u2019t have made sense 10 or even 5 years ago \u2013 not because I have more free time now, but because, early in your career, you learn much more by doing than reflecting. And this can be the difference between creating your future and receiving it in a fancy envelope. </p> <p>At the limit, you probably should care about work-life balance \u2013 it\u2019s not going to remain a static thing your whole life. But at the margin, as a new grad, you should focus on the most important problem. Find the thing that motivates you, work your ass off, learn as much as you can, and trust that today\u2019s gains will compound well into the future \u2013 your future.</p> <p>Working your ass off isn\u2019t bleak \u2013 it\u2019s quite the opposite. Provided there\u2019s a purpose, sprinting at an unsustainable pace is an act of tremendous optimism. A mindset of premature retirement might sound rosy, but in truth it\u2019s deeply cynical and extraordinarily insidious \u2013 much more so than being overpaid or overpraised, and much harder to correct.</p> <p>But back to the concept of caring about work-life balance at the limit, how do you know where the limit is? Isn\u2019t life fundamentally uncertain? Here\u2019s what I\u2019ve come to realize: you can\u2019t pre-emptively retire without doing the work that makes you appreciate the chance to rest. Maybe you can, but assuming you have something to contribute, it\u2019s going to be an empty reward. Sacrificing your potential to comfort isn\u2019t a hedge against an early death \u2013 it IS an early death. As Emerson wrote in Self-Reliance, \"Life only avails, not the having lived. Power ceases in the instant of repose; it resides in the moment of transition from a past to a new state, in the shooting of the gulf, in the darting to an aim.\u201d </p> <p>We\u2019ve been told over and over to choose life over work in order to achieve balance. I\u2019m urging you, especially at the dawn of your career, to  instead choose life over balance, and make the work so meaningful that you wouldn\u2019t want it to exist as a distinct concept. This is how you ensure that your future remains yours.</p>","tags":["tech"]},{"location":"writing/shreyas/","title":"Shreyas Karanth: Moving from SW Engg to Product","text":"<p>Shreyas Karanth is a Product Manager at Soroco.

What has been great is actually putting these things (that I'd read over the course of 2 years) into practice.

I've come to look at it this way: If things break, I'm not going to be the one who is going to dive in and fix it; that'll be the engineers. So, I should stop getting too involved here. (credit to @Pentropy for this advice)</p> </li> <li> <p>Writing in a way that non-technical folks can understand you has been challenging. (However, I think you will have no problem here, based on what I've seen of your writing from when you were in Soroco)</p> </li> <li> <p>The amount of organizational skills required to be a PM is pretty crazy. I thought of myself as a fairly organized person, but I've found myself coming up short after I became a PM. You need to deal with engineering, sales, marketing and also leadership. And you have only so many hours in the day.</p> </li> <li> <p>An addendum to the above point is that you will have to inevitably deprioritize some things owing to lack of bandwidth. Some people are bound to be unhappy with the priorities that you've chosen and you have to handle that well, since you may be asking them to prioritize something you need the very next week.</p> </li> <li> <p>Accountability for things that you can't directly control. You become the scapegoat, in some way, for problems that are hard for you to control. If the tech team runs into an unexpected issue and that delays a release, that's your problem.

If the marketing team has been too busy with other things to prepare collateral for you, that's still your problem.</p> </li> <li> <p>Your responsibilities are very fluid. As a tech guy, on every project/product I worked on, I knew my main set of responsibilities very clearly. I used to help out other people with their responsibilities, but I would make sure that I fulfilled my own first. As a PM, when there's something that needs to be done, and you can't clearly call it the engineering, marketing or sales team's responsibility, it just becomes your responsibility.

I'm sharing what I know in the hopes it's helpful to others.</p>"},{"location":"writing/tax-tips-for-consultants/#1-compliance-gst-lut-and-firc","title":"1. Compliance: GST, LUT and FIRC","text":"<ul> <li> <p>Threshold: Acquiring a GST number becomes almost mandatory once your income surpasses some X=20 lakhs INR in a given financial year. This step legitimizes your income and ensures compliance with Indian taxation laws. The X limits keeps changing and I'd recommend you check the latest one with a CA and NOT rely on Google for this. Some online services like ClearTax offer GST registration services, but I'd recommend you get it done via a CA. It's a one-time process and you don't need to renew it every year.</p> </li> <li> <p>Sole Proprietorship: If you are an individual, you get a GST number as a sole proprietor. This is the simplest way to get a GST number and is recommended for most consultants. You can also get a GST number as a private limited company, but that might be overkill for most consultants. My CA also recommended that I get an Udyog Certificate, so I did get one but I'm not sure if it's necessary.</p> </li> <li> <p>Quarterly Filing: If you are a sole proprietor or operating as an individual consultant, quarterly GST filing can be more manageable than doing it monthly. This approach helps streamline administrative tasks and keeps compliance straightforward.</p> </li> <li> <p>FIRC: Every time that you receive a payment from a foreign entity, you will need to get a Foreign Inward Remittance Certificate (FIRC) from your bank. This document is a proof of payment and is required for filing taxes. It is advisable to get a FIRC for each payment, as it can be difficult to get one later. Salt is a great tool for automating this process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Accounting &amp; Compliance: Using a CA to file for managing both your GST and Letter of Undertaking (LUT) is advisable. It serves as an effective tool for official documentation and ensures a smoother filing process.</p> </li> <li> <p>Current Account: Having a current account separate from your personal finances helps in meticulous financial management. It allows you to distinctly separate your business income and expenses, making accounting more cleaner. E.g. you can use this current to pay for your AWS bills. This can help you save on GST, as you can claim GST input credit on these expenses.</p> </li> <li> <p>Letter of Undertaking (LUT): For consultants involved in international transactions, an LUT is crucial. This legal document clarifies that all relevant taxes will be paid exclusively in India, thereby simplifying compliance requirements for cross-border business. It is advisable to get an LUT even if you are not sure if you will be involved in international transactions. You need to mention the LUT in your invoices to foreign entities.</p> </li> <li> <p>GST on Foreign Transactions: GST is not applicable on foreign transactions. However, you will need to mention the LUT in your invoices to foreign entities. This is to ensure that the GST authorities are aware that you are not liable to pay GST on these transactions.</p> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"writing/tax-tips-for-consultants/#11-gst-filing","title":"1.1 GST Filing","text":"<ul> <li>GST Filing: You can file GST monthly or quarterly.

This helps significantly in reducing your taxable income, which can be advantageous for many consultants. </li> </ul> <p>Example Math:</p> <p>If you make 72 lakhs INR in a year, you can assume 36 lakhs INR (half of 75 lakhs) as your expenses and pay taxes on the remaining 72-36=36 lakhs INR.

Source: ClearTax -- I'm unclear if Section 44ADA applies to this surcharge. </p> <ul> <li>&gt;50% Expenses: If your actual expenses amount to more than half of your income, then Section 44ADA may not offer you the best tax advantage. This is because you can only claim 50% of your income as an expense, even if your actual expenses are higher. You will have to get audited by a CA and file your taxes later (usually in September) if you want to claim more than 50% of your income as expenses.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"writing/tax-tips-for-consultants/#22-foreign-llc-or-c-corp","title":"2.2 Foreign LLC or C-Corp","text":"<ul> <li>LLC Abroad: If you are working with a foreign entity, it is sometimes useful to have a Limited Liability Company (LLC) in the country of the entity. E.g. you can open a Delaware LLC via Stripe Atlas and use that to invoice your clients. You will then pay taxes via this entity in the source country. It's only for the amount that you move to India, that you will pay taxes in India. </li> </ul> <p>If I remember correctly, you will be paying 8.7% corporate tax in Delaware, and similarly 8-9% in Dubai. With all of these, you pay additional 30% personal income tax in India. So if you make 100 lakhs INR in a year, you will pay 8.7 lakhs INR in the US. And then you pay personal income tax in India on your living expenses: So say, you move 18 lakhs INR to India, you will pay 0.3*18 = 5.4 lakhs INR in taxes in India. Effectively, you'd be paying 14.1% of your income in taxes. If you are making more than 100 lakhs INR in a year, this might be a good option for you.</p> <p>This can help simplify the process of receiving payments. However, it is important to note that this option is not always the most tax-efficient. It is advisable to consult a CA to understand the implications of this option for your specific amount, transaction frequency and expected personal expenses.</p> <p>RemoteIndian has a similar Tax Guide that you might find useful. </p>"},{"location":"writing/tax-tips-for-consultants/#3-invoicing","title":"3.
