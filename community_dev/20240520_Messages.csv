2023-05-17 12:26:00|Anubhav Mishra AI|https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/solo-vc-elad-gil-the-ai-whisperer/id1498270180?i=1000612864264
2023-05-17 12:26:08|Anubhav Mishra AI|A good one!
2023-05-18 12:25:16|Aditya Agrawal|What is the biggest GPU size you guys have used for training/fine tuning model? We are using 64GB and still running out of memory. Would highly appreciate any help in the regard .
2023-05-18 13:14:43|Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni|What’s the size of the model?
2023-05-18 13:26:19|Aditya Agrawal|DM'd you :)
2023-05-24 10:40:32|Aditya Agrawal|Welcome [PHONE] , Pratik is building KisaanGPT
2023-05-24 10:45:39|Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright|Could be a memory leak as well during the forward/backward pass? Might have to tune the parameters
2023-05-24 10:49:16|Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright|I had the same issue while training using LoRA, no matter how big the gpu it used to give OOM
2023-05-24 10:52:13|Aditya Agrawal|when we tried with reduced batch size it worked.
2023-05-24 10:52:49|Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright|It is still a suboptimal fix if it can hold bigger batches
2023-05-24 10:54:49|Aditya Agrawal|True..
2023-05-24 13:09:18|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Thanks Aditya
2023-05-25 03:31:38|Dev Aggarwal AI|Congratulations on the 50k users [PHONE] !
2023-05-25 03:40:27|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Thanks 🙏. 0.01% of people that we can affect, but small small victories are motivating.
2023-05-25 04:48:34|Shashwatv1 Consumableai|Congratulations indeed. 50k users on kisaangpt shud be celebrated. But curious why you say 0.01% (total farmers in India ~150Mn)
2023-05-25 04:58:18|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Kissan = Peasant, not just actual farmers
2023-05-25 05:11:26|Shashwatv1 Consumableai|education not so sure bcz a lot of these farmers have generational knowledge of know-how. But I feel finances is something that might attract em and hook for real. Saying this in the light of mgnrega and other finance schemes at that level
2023-05-25 05:14:08|Aditya Agrawal|👏👏👏
2023-05-25 05:15:08|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|What If I help them to find them suitable loan or scheme, best rates, give them steps and help through the entire process with backend banking API integration, without annoying man in the middle.
2023-05-25 05:16:58|Aditya Agrawal|Kisaan have high dependency on the traders who provide them loan and also have power to exploit them. There is definitely lot of information gap that exists. Pricing of paddy changes every hour. Payment terms are super variant as well..
2023-05-25 05:17:41|Aditya Agrawal|True
2023-05-25 05:20:18|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|They (Gov, Farmers, Banks) want to bypass the traders/middleman and also the daily/weekly/payday loan culture (exported from US) is exploiting them a lot. It will take time, looking at the size of our country, but if AI can't solve it, who will?
2023-05-25 05:23:02|Aditya Agrawal|I am from chattisgarh and have strong connects in rice/paddy industry. Willing to find you a connect in rice association. In case that helps?
2023-05-25 05:24:50|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|That would be very helpful. DMing.
2023-05-25 07:37:44|Shashwatv1 Consumableai|Hey ecosystem, as you wud be aware we are building a genAI first business intelligence platform. I think it'd be cool to free up bandwidth by automating repetitive tasks which wasn't possible until the rise of AI. We are focusing on data analytics space and wanted to get diverse feedback from international markets. So am looking for 2-3 warm connects with US based founders or any decision maker in a big or small business. Pls let me know if anyone can connect us with relevant person. Wud be very helpful.
2023-05-25 07:45:42|Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright|[PHONE] can definitely help with this
2023-05-25 07:48:25|Shashwatv1 Consumableai|Very kind of you [PHONE] for nominating [PHONE] will wait to hear from him. Thank you.
2023-05-29 11:36:51|Shouvik Ghosh Roy Mosaic Wellness|Has anyone had any experience leverage ai generated videos to customise app based on user details for offline usage? For example leverage brand ambassador creatives to customise onboarding.
2023-05-29 11:42:34|Sudharshan Ai|Rephrase and Gan AI do this
2023-05-29 11:43:01|Sudharshan Ai|Are you looking for a product or need help implementing something like this?
2023-05-29 12:07:06|Shouvik Ghosh Roy Mosaic Wellness|Ideally would like to implement this in house. Happy to explore products if they help us move faster.
2023-05-29 12:08:45|Dev Aggarwal AI|Please try https://sadtalker.github.io and let us know your experience! For me I couldn’t get it do aspect ratios right

2023-05-29 12:14:36|Shouvik Ghosh Roy Mosaic Wellness|Thanks! Let me explore
2023-05-29 12:16:28|Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai|Would recommend this as well - have heard some encouraging feedback anecdotally
2023-05-29 12:24:59|Dev Aggarwal AI|Is the pricing not as insane as d-id?
2023-05-29 12:26:12|Sudharshan Ai|30 USD for 10 mins
2023-05-29 12:26:42|Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright|justbaat.com - they have partnered with lots of Indian news channel, and are pretty cheap
2023-05-29 12:27:04|Sudharshan Ai|Not too bad - considering what it can do. But yes pricey and from a business POV - juicy margins.
2023-05-29 12:27:58|Dev Aggarwal AI|A100 costs like 1% of this. Sad talker would be a much better bet at any sort of scale
2023-05-29 12:30:16|Hari Sir|I use synthesia.io . I found it pretty easy and fast . Do not know if that is what you are looking for .

2023-06-09 18:37:03|Aditya Agrawal|[PHONE] for average profit margin I believe 20-30% is industry standard
2023-06-09 18:38:19|Aditya Agrawal|Who has distribution keeps 30%
2023-06-09 18:38:37|Sudharshan Ai|Thanks, seems low?
2023-06-09 18:38:44|Sudharshan Ai|Okay, and the rest 70%?
2023-06-09 18:40:12|Aditya Agrawal|So I’ll give an example: we have our AI offering which anyone can embed on their platform or to the existing customer. And we are perpetually happy to give 30% of revenue to them.
2023-06-09 18:41:49|Aditya Agrawal|But in general for a SAAS product margin should be around 80%
2023-06-09 18:42:46|Aditya Agrawal|Anyone from VC ecosystem who would like to take that?

2023-06-10 07:27:34|Aishwarya Goel AI|Could be different for AI companies because of heavy infra cost.. 
2023-06-10 07:29:24|Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni|Today infra is the biggest cost for an AI company
2023-06-10 07:29:49|Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni|So that will definitely hurt their margins in the short term till infra costs get amortised

2023-06-10 08:32:23|Aditya Agrawal|Dm'd you
2023-06-10 08:32:54|Aditya Agrawal|Have been discussing this for long.
2023-06-10 09:12:51|Sumod Mohan Ai|Thanks for this write up Brij and great to see you all put in substantial money as well to help build foundations. Two cents, we have had revolutions even in this Generation of AI, first came CNNs, RNNs and then Transformers. So there is some likelihood that there will new type of models too, that will allow smaller more compact models. This was true earlier too, when ANN flourished they then got replaced by SVMs. US puts lots of money both in academic research of flavours and Industry taking bets in those (DeepMind:RL, OpenAI:CNN/Transformers, AllenAI, Vicarious:Prob models, Ayasdi: Topological models etc) and so on. If we want to be ahead, we as an ecosystems will have to take those calculated risks I feel. We probably should work on what the next models could be, not just trying to reach parity.
2023-06-10 09:15:52|Brij Singh Rebright Partners|Yup absolutely agree .. there is too much fixation on existing Models. For eg, I would like to understand how Multi-modal FMs will evolve in the coming years.

2023-07-03 19:15:49|Ankesh Atlasian AI|I meant the parallels of dynatrace/ moogsoft/ bigpanda
2023-07-03 19:40:20|Hemant Mohapatra Lightspeed Ai|I'm sure there are several investors looking at this category so, for the right team, there should be plenty of interest. I've been looking at MLops startups across India and US since 2017 but frankly it's a tough area with plenty of OSS tools and no big success after a decade of trying. From Michelangelo to fblearner to airflow to various cloud native tools and 100s more, the MLOps category unfortunately got too fragmented based on different tastes of different data science teams. What's interesting about LLMops is that it seems to be much closer and integrated to the enterprise data stack today than ML ever was -- and therefore likely to align to more standardized practices -- so I'm more hopeful for this category. We've made one adjacent investment here at lightspeed and happy to see more.
2023-07-03 19:42:09|Sudharshan Ai|That’s a nice observation
2023-07-03 19:47:16|Dhruv Anand|related: is there an open-source tool that is close to fblearner?
2023-07-03 19:53:04|Ankesh Atlasian AI|Sorry for the confusion, I understand the term AI Ops can be confused with ML Ops which is more popularly known. AI Ops was a term coined by Gartner to categorise the capability of using AI in the IT Ops or Devops realm(like for incident detection, fault localisation, etc) whereas ML Ops is the domain of Operating ML workloads.
2023-07-03 19:55:28|Ankesh Atlasian AI|Some example companies playing in the AI Ops domain are moogsoft, bigpanda, dynatrace, datadog, servicenow
2023-07-03 21:19:56|Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright|Fblearner is nothing but a feature store and facebook scale. Every company has a feature store nowadays.
2023-07-03 21:21:30|Dhruv Anand|I meant the whole model lifecycle management (particularly cloning flows, click to start training job, model lineage, data selection). I know mlflow does some of this but it seems very barebones.

2023-07-03 21:47:12|Sumod Mohan Ai|2c: We had used DVC and datalad at different times. Datalad is great if you use git-annex, it is great for data provence, model tracking etc but no flows, atleast that is my memory. One click etc were mostly thin layers on top. Automated gsheets sheets (basically touch a particular cell and an experiment is automatically run on cloud). Over time we figured out Excel sheets were best for our usecase, this is about about 20+ projects + upto few 1000 experiments per project. Excel sheet was great because we could pivot on important characteristics etc. We sort of had the feel of what Quora described about their CI/CD deployment, people doing all sorts of experiments now that it was super easy to do. DVC also supports basic flows etc. Don't know enough about details FBlearner's  flows to compare.
2023-07-03 21:48:34|Sumod Mohan Ai|Would love to hear what others use.
2023-07-03 21:59:05|Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright|AB testing everything is the reason meta products have no taste (personal opinion)
2023-07-03 22:09:59|Shashwatv1 Consumableai|hmm. But whatsapp, instagram seems fine. Even though they moved Reels button noticeably many times, capability to change the icon in such a short timelines per user, does highlight that. We all know Airbnb is another example of exploiting experimentation.

2023-07-11 10:23:06|Aditya Agrawal|There are like 100 + reasons to have a cofounder..
2023-07-11 10:27:04|Nirant Generative AI|What changed between Jan 2023 and now? xD
2023-07-11 10:29:08|Divya Tak Ai|Yea. Now being the operative word
2023-07-11 10:30:18|Aditya Agrawal|Nothing much I guess. I always wanted/want to add great people to the team. No doubts in that.  We just have more clarity on what we are building and need right set of people to drill down on and take ownership. and having the right person at the right time adds leaps and bounce.
2023-07-11 10:33:57|~ Piyush Makhija|Have you looked at https://defog.ai/
2023-07-11 10:34:50|Nirant Generative AI|I built a lot of the tech for defog.ai during Jan to Apr this year
2023-07-11 10:34:54|Hari Sir|I think a lot of things have changed since Jan 2023 of this year . Funding winter - followed by GAI which in my views has totally disrupted several SAAS and similar businesses . So out of the box thinkers are very important to add to founding teams as cofounders or as key hires - who can now commit to work on a specific problem / domain for the next 7-10 years . So it is a a good time to add fresh blood to founding teams . My 2c 😎
2023-07-11 10:36:49|~ Piyush Makhija|Can you provide some details on what you built for them 😀
2023-07-11 10:36:57|Nirant Generative AI|My controversial take is if I know a deep technical engineer who can be a co-founder, I'll refer him to a friend in SF not BLR. Because better outcomes across all relevant areas. 
2023-07-11 10:37:09|Nirant Generative AI|*refer them
2023-07-11 10:37:38|Aditya Agrawal|What if we were a SF based company?
2023-07-11 10:38:15|Nirant Generative AI|Yes, on-premise and GPT4 powered both. Mostly eval methods and sets because the founders are sharp and can do lot of the prompt work themselves
2023-07-11 10:39:06|Nirant Generative AI|idk what SF based means, but if you're selling and building in SF — that meets the criteria. If you've a single dev in India, that doesn't count.
2023-07-11 10:41:26|Aditya Agrawal|will learn from you deeply about it offline. Will help us with our next step.
2023-07-11 10:46:04|Pallav Nadhani|Adding controversy to your controversial take :) 1/ the “depth” & pool of engineers there in bay area is much higher, so founders there have a lot more / “better” option at hiring foundational / “core” engineering founder 2/ if problem statement to be solved is vertical & has india data/element, Indian founders may be better suited 3/ equal opportunities in terms of fund raising available both sides.
2023-07-11 10:48:10|Aditya Agrawal|"""if problem statement to be solved is vertical & has india data/element, Indian founders may be better suited"" Our problem statement is global."
2023-07-11 10:48:37|Aditya Agrawal|"""equal opportunities in terms of fund raising available both sides."" Havent looked into this side for a while now."
2023-07-11 10:51:46|Neha Nupoor Yc|Interesting. One of their challenges were to know when the model was trained enough
2023-07-11 10:51:53|Neha Nupoor Yc|Was that solved?
2023-07-11 10:54:42|Nirant Generative AI|Not completely, but lot of progress
2023-07-11 10:55:13|Neha Nupoor Yc|How do you even measure something like that? What is the approach?
2023-07-11 10:56:33|Mayank Gupta|Why should it make a difference if there is a single dev in India?
2023-07-11 10:56:49|~ Kaushik Bokka|+1
2023-07-11 11:09:49|Nirant Generative AI|Time zone, culture and friction between rev-maxxing and cost-saving kicks in too soon. My (hypothetical) friend is less likely to get a US VISA/salary if the company has desi devs in team
2023-07-11 11:10:09|Nirant Generative AI|Mind you, this is for an engineering co-founder/leaders, not IC product engineers or similar
2023-07-11 11:22:34|Aditya Agrawal|Having a cofounder in US costs company 50-60k whereas having a developer costs 150-200k. Its easy as a founder to live in US and manage yourself at low cost but there is nearly 0% chance that you can hire anyone below 100k.
2023-07-11 11:24:16|Aditya Agrawal|A cofounder goes to any level to work on any Time zone, manage conflict and culture and works together on every step. Whereas otherwise most people look for what is best for themselves. and quit in tough times.
2023-07-11 11:40:25|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|Have been talking to a lot of friends from SF. I think I disagree now. For FAANG yes, but for early engineers or founders I think building for US market Is better but having engineers anywhere in the world is better.
2023-07-11 11:42:41|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|"""Finding"" a cofounder is also different from ""starting with someone"". The latter is when ppl will compromise. Much harder to ""find"" people who will compromise."
2023-07-11 11:42:44|Nirant Generative AI|Yeah, it's better for the founder, not for the engineer 🤣
2023-07-11 11:43:19|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|In US, even further since absolute need of money is different in orders.
2023-07-11 11:43:44|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|Also, its far uncommon to get 1% of a seed stage company in US than in India.
2023-07-11 11:44:09|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|Best arbitrage I feel is build for and raise in US, work from anywhere.
2023-07-11 11:44:19|Nirant Generative AI|And early engineers is a scam in India, zero trust — I've done that for 5 years of my career, and I'd rather jump from a bridge than do that again or send a friend down that path
2023-07-11 11:44:36|Pallav Nadhani|Elaborate more pls?
2023-07-11 11:44:37|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|Well, you joined a bad place :P
2023-07-11 11:45:30|Nirant Generative AI|Well, you joined exceptional places :P
2023-07-11 11:45:32|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|Recently heard early engineer stories from fk, zomato and likes of tier 1 Indian startups. They have done really well and the companies have backed them a lot better.
2023-07-11 11:45:36|Neha Nupoor Yc|Interested in knowing more
2023-07-11 11:46:04|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|I didnt. I did join a bad place once too. You think no such scammy startups in SF?
2023-07-11 11:46:17|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|They are more there.
2023-07-11 11:46:28|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|Capital availability increases scams not reduces.
2023-07-11 11:46:55|Pallav Nadhani|I think it’s more about the need “to show growth” (even if forcefully), to raise additional rounds.
2023-07-11 11:47:07|Nirant Generative AI|There are, but they pay more for the same scam. And rule of law still exists.
2023-07-11 11:47:22|Nirant Generative AI|Like at least the written word will have some value e.g. ESOP/shares
2023-07-11 11:47:50|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|depends what we call value I think.
2023-07-11 11:47:50|Pallav Nadhani|Assuming most ESOPs aren’t underwater, already
2023-07-11 11:48:10|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|"Are you saying US founders dont need to ""show growth""?"
2023-07-11 11:48:35|Pallav Nadhani|Everyone does. But the force fit is where it gets into muddled waters, either side of world
2023-07-11 11:49:04|~ Kaushik Bokka|Sigh. I am so glad people are calling out the Dukaan founder for his tweet. 
2023-07-11 11:49:24|Nirant Generative AI|I've also not mentioned the learning curve, but why would I refer folks to founders in India unless I know the founder to be great. 
2023-07-11 11:49:42|Pallav Nadhani|Could be a well executed marketing bait too, which in case, then has done the job well #devilsAdvocate
2023-07-11 11:49:45|Shalabh Singh AI ASPIRO|Any relevant experiences you can share Nirant?
2023-07-11 11:49:46|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|Thats true for SF too no? Would you refer me to a stranger in US? 🥺
2023-07-11 11:50:04|Nirant Generative AI|That must've been intentional. Suumit ran digital marketing for housing and tinyowl for years, and they both used negative marketing to great effect.
2023-07-11 11:50:21|Nirant Generative AI|Go look at my Linkedin 🤣
2023-07-11 11:50:36|Nirant Generative AI|Hmm, I know more exceptional founders in SF than BLR if that makes it clearer
2023-07-11 11:51:42|~ ashish|He could have definitively phrased it much better.
2023-07-11 11:52:30|Nirant Generative AI|Lololo no
2023-07-11 11:52:55|Nirant Generative AI|It was intentional and I'm sure it must've worked amazingly well.
2023-07-11 11:53:09|~ Kaushik Bokka|Well. Still insensitive to the laid off employees :)
2023-07-11 11:53:28|Nirant Generative AI|I've deleted those tweets but I used that thought process of attractive negative attention to raise for the hackathon too. 
2023-07-11 11:53:40|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|To be honest I doubt anyone really got laid off :P
2023-07-11 11:53:44|Nirant Generative AI|Well, ironically friends are trying to persuade me that it's okay to refer folks here
2023-07-11 11:54:07|Nirant Generative AI|Not because of AI anyone
2023-07-11 11:54:18|Nirant Generative AI|*anyway
2023-07-11 11:55:09|Nirant Generative AI|Prolly more because of market conditions and change in how much India2 is spending — which you can see from Amrutanjan, Relaxo sales and margins too. If people aren't buying balm (literal painkiller!) —  I doubt other categories are expanding fast. 
2023-07-11 11:57:23|Nishant SiteRecon AI|I think in US a lot many people are using Carta or other tools for ESOP management from very early on (since the inception of company). This provides some level of paperwork for the employees, and security 
2023-07-11 11:58:01|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|VCs enforce these things in India too. Non VC funded companies sure have a risk attached.

2023-07-11 11:58:32|"~ Pratiksha | Graphia.AI"|I believe, a lot of these conversations are tangential to the theme of this group & can be done over DMs.
2023-07-11 11:59:08|‪+1 (217) 904‑6011‬|I think most Indian founders don't realize the value of relationships before its too late. Early engineers should be the leaders of what they are doing, and not just executers. 
2023-07-11 12:03:47|Nishant SiteRecon AI|Yup.
2023-07-11 12:04:07|Aditya Agrawal|There are good and apples everywhere. We all have our learnings and experiences. I hired 2 folks very early on in their career . Trained them on leadership and gave enough time to fail and learn themes elves on technical skills. One of them has moved to a Director role in the startup, other is moving to US for higher education but continuing to work with us. First one is great long term value driver and other one is bit more risky but great value to the team. I think only thing I’m not ready to do is - to put tags and make conclusions.
2023-07-11 12:05:09|Bhavya e/acc|"""bit more risky"" - how?"
2023-07-11 12:05:31|Aditya Agrawal|He might decide to join a US company in future and not work with us

2023-07-11 12:10:22|‪+91 77990 81425‬|This is very loosely enforced if at all, even in vc funded startups. Have heard plenty of stories from early engineers where they got cheated on their esops/bonuses/perks, built complete products meanwhile and had to move because of not getting what they earned.
2023-07-11 12:18:07|Aditya Agrawal|Indian law is not very clear on ESOP and options which make it challenging for everyone in the ecosystem to act on it.
2023-07-11 13:37:00|Sumod Mohan Ai|"Lack of experience probably. When you have too many people to please and you focus on wrong group at the wrong time. Many engineers and others now must be thinking ""when us"". Probably not the culture you want to create, esp if you are in deep shit."

2023-07-12 10:42:13|"~ Avikalp | Vibinex.com"|I actually did. I've have both experiences. I left the bad place in 3 months of joining. And I stayed in the good place for 3.5 years, was rewarded well for it - and now that the company is also profitable (after my departure though), they called us back for a party to celebrate that our ESOPs will not go to zero value.
2023-07-12 10:42:57|"~ Avikalp | Vibinex.com"|And now, in my own startup also, I have hired an early engineer. She is amazing - really takes ownership and sees her own success in the success of the company. And I plan to reward her handsomely as well.
2023-07-12 10:44:22|"~ Avikalp | Vibinex.com"|I think it is just a matter of luck. All three cases involved strong references. Although, in both the good experiences, there is also a pre-existing social connection between the founders and the early employees.

2023-07-17 08:22:23|Anubhav Mishra AI|Speaks focus is well positioned, it's not a language learning platform. It is for improving fluency in English so that any immigrant(s) gains fluency so that they are able to navigate the language barrier, otherwise which is very difficult

2023-07-23 11:00:48|‪+91 95913 74691‬|Yeah, SiteGPT did the same.
2023-07-23 11:00:59|Rahul Bhatnagar Ai|Will check them out. The indie devs have an advantage here. With very quick time to market + rapid experimentation.
2023-07-23 11:01:52|‪+91 95913 74691‬|but it was undoubtedly because of the hype. If you build something like that today you won't be able to get that growth which is what I'm saying. Indie devs do not get that kind of growth.
2023-07-23 11:03:36|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Or you can go for a specific domain with kb curation service in b2b instead of generic talk to data tool.
2023-07-23 11:04:12|Rahul Bhatnagar Ai|I think it more about launching the product at the right cycle than building a chatbase right now. And increasing your shots at finding the hype cycle by launching products quickly.
2023-07-23 11:08:00|Rahul Bhatnagar Ai|Yeah. This is the famous SaaS debate - high touchpoint with longer sales cycles + high revenue/user vs low touch self serve products that are basically like consumer products.
2023-07-23 11:09:23|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Do we have any consumer startup making profits since start of the ZIRP cycle without burning VC money? ‎<This message was edited>
2023-07-23 11:11:16|Rahul Bhatnagar Ai|Haha yeah. Bad choice of words. I meant products that don’t need sales teams etc. but rely on PLG (similiar to consumer products.)
2023-07-23 11:11:39|~ Siddharth Bulia|Nykaa?
2023-07-23 11:12:56|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|They are not a tech company
2023-07-23 11:13:13|Aditya Agrawal|We burnt our hands doing sales/enterprise last couple of months and now starting PLG approach
2023-07-23 11:15:43|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|IMO AI consumer or product led growth is a very long game and due to reproducibility and novelty, consumers are going to keep trying new things. No loyalty.
2023-07-23 11:17:39|~ Prashant Singh|can you expand upon this ? your observation is global or India specific
2023-07-23 11:19:44|Shashwatv1 Consumableai|Probably bcz consumer attention is finite. Loyalty is hard to build.
2023-07-23 11:20:36|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Indian consumer is more stingy, so they will go for cheaper and freer option first. But Indian consumer is not worried about privacy and other things. Global, is opposite so consumer adaption will be through incumbent trust.
2023-07-23 11:22:02|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|So for good product, only option can be acquisition game
2023-07-23 11:22:31|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Again, this is my “opinion”
2023-07-23 11:22:58|~ Chinmay Shah|IDP would put restrictions on companies using consumer data. but the worry would only be personal data, should be good otherwise.
2023-07-23 11:24:34|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|IDP is for big corps. We don’t have  workforce or competency in government to enforce at startup level ‎<This message was edited>
2023-07-23 11:33:23|Anubhav Mishra AI|At least IMO the New 'new moat'  in consumer products will be the extent of personalization. So companies building there should and must also focus on understanding personalization typically killing it at models like the Hooked model by nir eyal. 
2023-07-23 11:35:37|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Yeah, heard Nat Frieman saying the same thing in one of the meetup. ‘AI gf’ is no-no topic for many incumbent, and that consumer domain is widely open to capture. ‎<This message was edited>
2023-07-23 11:39:07|Anubhav Mishra AI|Inflection AI is a classic example of creating moat  In the Foundation model space + consumer use cases. Have a look at the extent at which pi is personalized it is just insanely better than bard and others even than c.ai which apparently I thought can be a good consumer product but they have been lagging there as well.
2023-07-23 11:40:20|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Pi is bad though. The hype died in a week. Not good for consumer product. Character.ai is probably a better example.
2023-07-23 11:41:10|Mayank Gupta|Interesting that you both have the exact opposite take on Inflection vs C.ai!
2023-07-23 11:42:22|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|That’s healthy actually. We have runway to calibrate opinions.
2023-07-23 11:42:51|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|[PHONE] check out buzz that Hermes model is creating.
2023-07-23 11:42:57|Mayank Gupta|Totally agree. Love it and waiting to hear more. Agree with the base premise so very interested!
2023-07-23 11:43:36|Anubhav Mishra AI|I don't think so, their moat is going to clear when they start building use cases on top of just the Pi chatbot. 
2023-07-23 11:44:02|Anubhav Mishra AI|Thanks! I'll check it out :)
2023-07-23 11:44:06|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Hermes, I see that as a good start in personalized AI companion running locally, away from data privacy and less RLHF corp crap ‎<This message was edited>
2023-07-23 11:45:11|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|If I want a companion to whom I talk about everything, I want local and away from large corps data minefield. The reason we don’t like or talk to Alexa much.
2023-07-23 11:46:01|~ Prashant Singh|why you like Character .ai . i tried it. it get basic things wrong
2023-07-23 11:47:09|Anubhav Mishra AI|Spotify
2023-07-23 11:47:20|Anubhav Mishra AI|Again personalization
2023-07-23 11:47:22|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|I don’t like it either. I was talking about how people may like personalized content. Ultimate personalized companion, in my opinion should be in my premise, who may even store my ssn and bank account to book an appointment.
2023-07-23 11:49:52|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Personalized use cases that will be product that real people will use are not talking to Mark, but someone booking my appointment, and have personal information. Something that has own persona.
2023-07-23 11:50:28|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Talking to zuck and Elon are gimmicks. Not a real use case.
2023-07-23 11:55:28|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|I guess we are talking a lot further in future, so I’ll stop my chain of thoughts.
2023-07-23 11:59:49|Anubhav Mishra AI|+1
2023-07-23 12:00:37|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Having names that you can count by fingers after billions of dollars of investment is not a good look though. Most of the consumer one that got acquired, took down incumbent with them. ‎<This message was edited>
2023-07-23 12:01:05|Mayank Gupta|My small thought here is that the other capability which will come in here is Planning / Coordination. So that along with Personalisation will be the true differentiator
2023-07-23 12:02:06|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Completely agree. My personalization definition has more to do with planning then having a soft spoken bot.
2023-07-23 12:02:51|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Someone I can feel safe to share my ssn and Adhar.
2023-07-23 12:04:01|Mayank Gupta|Yeah. I separate it into Decision Making and Execution. Decision making is the personalisation part (along with expandable memory - for eg that coupon that's about to expire too) and the latter is the Planning Coordination part ‎<This message was edited>
2023-07-23 12:04:28|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Plan and book the whole trip to Iceland, give me a packing list and brief me about the itinerary on flight.
2023-07-23 12:07:43|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|That’s why smart folks at OpenAI came up with plugins. They are eating next abstraction layers lunch money, before founders realize.
2023-07-23 12:08:38|Mayank Gupta|Though I personally think we've miles to go before the right UX emerges!
2023-07-23 12:09:27|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|But not everyone will like OpenAI, but OpenAI is successfully Abel to convince these companies to have plugin.json file on their website. Now, that other should be able exploit too. 😜 ‎<This message was edited>
2023-07-23 12:11:17|Mayank Gupta|This is the other part I think is critical which was getting discussed sometime back. I believe in an open communication layer - more natural language I/O akin to the Internet. If you support it as an app / plugin, you can allow any Personal AI to make use of it
2023-07-23 12:11:51|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|If ChatGPT can query Expedia, Hermes at my home should be Abel to do it, too. (Of course in future)

2023-07-24 00:08:29|‪+91 88980 20185‬|No. Just no. If that's a startup selling 1000s of SKUs they will get into the world of vectorDBs and then it will be a longgg grind. Cosine similarity is nobodies frnd. It will take way longer than 2 months to be something customers will pay for. Not to forget infosec and compliance. Wait till it suggests the competitor as sota. These things take longer than 2 months to be custom and accurate
2023-07-24 00:14:48|‪+91 96321 47475‬|IMHO those are really short term.

2023-07-24 19:48:36|‪+91 96321 47475‬|Don't think MSFT has much market share in sales/sales CRMs. I doubt if it will really affect anything.

The idea is to contextualize the information and try to extract the most relevant parts as well as insights for you.  The value we want to provide is in how we use ai to actually make your life easier without a necessary input from you. The product should not add any cognitive load to you but still help you work better by pushing right things to you at the right time. A sort of a right hand man who you don't have to instruct or teach how to do things.

2023-08-01 10:08:41|Nirant Generative AI|How many DGX 100 can we buy in $500K [PHONE] on today's rates?
2023-08-01 10:15:23|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|2 & keep the remaining for your electricity bill
2023-08-01 10:16:05|Nirant Generative AI|Okay, how many can we rent for a year? About 7-10?
2023-08-01 10:16:15|Nirant Generative AI|The 40G one ofc
2023-08-01 10:17:12|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|With the new funding from Nvidia you could totally strike a great deal with Lamda Labs or CoreWeave. Nvidia cloud is also doubling down as an alternative to public clouds
2023-08-01 10:17:25|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|10 easy!
2023-08-01 10:21:58|Dev Aggarwal AI|About 40 in gcp spot instances
2023-08-01 10:22:42|Dev Aggarwal AI|80 probably if you talk to them cause at half a mil they’ll give you bulk discount
2023-08-01 10:23:08|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|Discounts are for recurring usage.
2023-08-01 10:23:50|Dev Aggarwal AI|They told me if I give them a ramp plan for like 200k they’ll give me upto 50% discount
2023-08-01 10:24:04|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|Yea coz they are assuming you’ll continue.
2023-08-01 10:24:20|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|Coz once you ramp up, likely case you can’t disappear.
2023-08-01 10:24:36|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|[PHONE] on the other hand is thinking differently here iiuc
2023-08-01 10:24:59|Nirant Generative AI|Stop spilling my plans like this Soumyadeep
2023-08-01 10:25:36|Kishore (Workbrow) Ai|In how many years?
2023-08-01 10:25:44|Dev Aggarwal AI|1
2023-08-01 10:25:58|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|Also personal opinion around clouds is that mental overhead of running opex often hampers experiments.
2023-08-01 10:26:33|Nirant Generative AI|That is why I asked if I can buy first
2023-08-01 10:27:13|Nirant Generative AI|(Puts on my buzzfeed hat) Investors wouldn't encourage cloud so strongly if they knew this one trick!
2023-08-01 10:27:38|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|But recently learnt having compute isn’t enough, storage on capex is needed too. 
2023-08-01 10:28:00|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|So soon you’ll be managing a mini cloud
2023-08-01 10:28:46|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|Hahaha I think it’s not that trivial a trick
2023-08-01 10:28:57|Nirant Generative AI|"I love how you call a $200K cloud ""mini"""
2023-08-01 10:29:26|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|Micro is Moro accurate I think
2023-08-01 10:29:31|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|*more
2023-08-01 10:29:34|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|True only for scale. Zoox went from AWS to having their own cluster of 1500 GPUs & a team to maintain it to back to AWS. For smaller workloads, setting up your own cluster is the best idea
2023-08-01 10:30:08|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|I’ll argue zoox couldn’t hire well 😋
2023-08-01 10:30:33|Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons|Also it depends a lot on just pure conviction of the person incharge
2023-08-01 10:31:11|Nirant Generative AI|Does someone know engineers and folks at Zoox? Maybe a great cloud/infra case for GPUs in particular?

2023-08-01 10:35:37|Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni|Maybe they are training critical models in house and other models on AWS? IMO, the moment the model becomes big enough that you need to do tensor parallel and pipeline parallel methods, you will need to hire more people who understand it better. These are not so intuitive but NVDIA has tried to make it as easy as possible on cuda but still it needs some handholding. Which is why they charge the additional $100k in support when they price a DGX-H100(SXM)
2023-08-01 10:36:55|Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni|Cluster management for in house cluster is not that trivial. Even in the Bloomberg GPT paper and the earlier GPT papers, they talk about how many times they had to restart training due to HW downtimes etc
2023-08-01 10:37:30|Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni|That said every org does make a choice between doing this in house vs paying that extra money to any CSP
2023-08-01 10:37:35|Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni|It’s a trade off
2023-08-01 10:38:18|Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni|Not sure if this has been shared here: https://gpus.llm-utils.org/nvidia-h100-gpus-supply-and-demand/ - This is an interesting article

2023-08-07 14:38:36|~ Rajiv Poddar|No, I meant developer API access. They have a rate limits on the API. You have to apply for production API key to get it removed.
2023-08-07 14:42:16|~ Chinmay Shah|you have to request dec access on their website
2023-08-07 14:42:18|‪+91 87870 63672‬|As I see it on their website, they are accepting applications for access, not giving it just by login
2023-08-07 14:43:20|~ Chinmay Shah|this is for developer access. Once you are ready for production access, we have to apply for access. that entails answering some trust and safety answers.
2023-08-07 14:44:03|‪+91 87870 63672‬|yes exactly, any idea how much time does it take for the basic dev access?

2023-08-11 09:26:49|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|The reason I’m asking, the Atoms looks like a much better deal

2023-08-11 09:28:00|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|The challenge with Indian VCs is deal flow is too high, capital is too low

2023-08-11 09:29:23|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Man, I have a little reservations about some of these cultiest looking things in SF. Most of the time it is insiders who gets in, just like YC.

2023-08-11 09:43:05|Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai|One thing YC does well is that people start using your products & give you feedback
2023-08-11 09:43:33|Aditya Agrawal|I get 3 inbound reach outs every week because our name is similar to a YC backed startup.  and they want to be associated with that.
2023-08-11 09:43:50|Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai|Good idea and thought for sure - not all products can be built out this way though
2023-08-11 09:45:02|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Don’t get me wrong, YC is great and they have build the valley indirectly. It’s like a huge invite only club where your dog food is get eaten by the club to get you the initial boost in revenue and clout. ‎<This message was edited>

2023-08-15 18:01:22|Anubhav Mishra AI|Don't think  Anthropic  will just build Claude as an end product, they will purely be after all the large/ medium size companies. Might be a leader in genAI KMS and tools.
2023-08-15 18:04:57|Anubhav Mishra AI|It would be really cool if someone might explain why post 450 mil raise they are raising 100 mil ( what deal structure) and also is it really so costly in terms of capital required?

2023-08-15 18:17:29|‪+91 99629 64599‬|Or could be a strategic investment + some data sharing agreements 😅
2023-08-15 18:17:32|‪+91 90130 07300‬|It is a strategic deal aimed to built custom LLMs for telcos.
2023-08-15 18:19:12|Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai|Is that a big enough incentive for a company that's chasing AGI? 
2023-08-15 18:23:22|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|IMO these hw purchases are going to backfire big time as smaller customized models will start getting bigger chunks of the pie. Every enterprise customers I have talked to want to have their llama.
2023-08-15 18:24:21|Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai|which is precisely why I do not think they're targeting enterprise use-cases at all
2023-08-15 18:24:59|‪+91 90130 07300‬|It is definitely a large market with custom telco applications across customer service, sales, other interactive apps. The road to AGI is not clear and likely many steps
2023-08-15 18:26:46|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Billions of funding, to get small chunk of customer acquisition cost for each verticals doesn’t make sense. B2C is where Apple, Google, MS and Amazon have better business established.
2023-08-15 18:27:56|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|It’s AGI or bust for these 3-4 companies
2023-08-15 19:07:08|Anubhav Mishra AI|I think Pi ( inflection) will also look to provide it's Inflection models which is purely a personalized AI experience ( that's the claim) will attract a lot of b2b deals , from Mustafas podcasts and interviews I sense some ambitious statement that they want anyone who's looking to build a conversational OS will look to use I1 model. 
2023-08-15 19:07:58|Anubhav Mishra AI|Precedent is that they have too opened access for the waitlist of their Inflection 1 API.
2023-08-15 19:17:26|Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai|Yeah, so here's why I think what I think - 
2023-08-15 19:27:00|Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai|"Also I have been ""thinking out loud"" on this: providing API access to others could mean quite a few things - "

2023-08-15 19:39:38|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Llama2 and all the hacking going around it have completely change these both, and that’s why they are all talking like that.
2023-08-15 19:42:02|Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai|We should have another discussion on this some time :) 
2023-08-15 19:42:58|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Agreed
2023-08-15 19:43:24|‪+91 77954 00389‬|I agree with Pratyush,  economics of adapting these in present are not feasible.
2023-08-15 19:43:28|Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai|Let's not forget 30th Nov '23 was when ChatGPT launched - most serious F500 companies will have procurement cycles longer than ChatGPT's existence
2023-08-15 19:44:34|Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai|Serious F500 is another way of saying big banks, telcos, oil companies, physical retail stores etc - all of them who move the world's GDP today

2023-08-16 11:39:02|Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai|Do we think that IT services can evolve themselves and adapt to what's happening here?
2023-08-16 11:53:44|Anubhav Mishra AI|https://mck.co/3YmZEq0
2023-08-16 11:53:47|Anubhav Mishra AI|Pretty cool stuff
2023-08-16 11:54:46|‪+91 77022 55597‬|Yes, I do. I also don't think the need for IT services will go away soon.
2023-08-16 11:59:48|Anshul Bhide Replit|Thanks for this article; super interesting. I think in the short term, on the supply side we'll see that some of the cost benefits flow to IT providers margins (e.g. a script that previously look 5 engineers now will take 3 engineers with Gen AI). But I agree with this article that eventually IT customers will try and renegotiate contracts (especially T&M ones) with IT providers and that cost benefit will move to customers. So you'll likely see more outcome based projects than T&M projects.
2023-08-16 12:10:53|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|"Clickbait. From the title, it sounds GenAI helped to set the world record. ""Fans of all ages were able to ask questions and engage in conversation with the record-breaking car via the generative AI-powered interface, which told them everything they wanted to know about the race and the performance of the cars shooting past them.”"
2023-08-16 12:12:21|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Why anyone will use GenAI with real-time data analysis, I'm sure some Fortune 500 executives will spend 250-500K to explore.

2023-08-16 12:14:36|Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai|IT services will still be required, I guess both of us are saying the same thing?

2023-08-21 10:17:17|Anubhav Mishra AI|Also once you use sales navigator, it's so cool that for any conversation or interest you're receiving, you can then use it to set the persona on LinkedIn ads.

2023-08-23 06:05:18|Kartik Springworks|their value add is not money but the visa/immigration which for many immigrants is the most important thing. This is not something YC etc will do
2023-08-23 06:07:24|Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai|Again a lot of investors in India help founders in getting visas
2023-08-23 06:08:16|Neha Nupoor Yc|YC helps with O1, 3 basic criterias are met with the YC funding and Letter of recommendation.
2023-08-23 06:10:12|Kartik Springworks|Got it. I'm not an expert but from my personal experience 10 years ago - O1s are harder than h1b. Indian investors do help but from what I know Unshackled takes you on their payroll
2023-08-23 06:11:12|Neha Nupoor Yc|o1 is harder yes. thats where the selection works out well for founders. If unshackled takes you on their payroll, i am not sure how you will own the shares and the company on h1b
2023-08-23 06:11:31|Neha Nupoor Yc|founders on h1b in YC had to quit and figure out a visa situation.
2023-08-23 06:12:08|Neha Nupoor Yc|math is not math-ing for me 🤔
2023-08-23 06:18:27|Nitin Mahajan 88 Vc|O1 is also getting over subscribed and backlogged now. In the last 1 year I know people who have figured out how to get O1done.
2023-08-23 06:26:18|Kartik Springworks|Yes that’s possible. You can do that
2023-08-23 06:33:22|Enkrypt.ai Prashant AI|I am not associated with the program, so I might be wrong. From my understanding, this is meant to pre-pre-seed stage (zygote 😁 couldn't help containing the joke) and idea exploration/experimentation. If one is thinking of a bigger investment/team formation then others have mentioned more suitable alternatives.
2023-08-23 06:38:11|Aditya Agrawal|US Visa is bad and no matter which new program will get bad over time. They have tried it with H1, EB5, O1, L1 etc etc .. the problem is the world wants to be in US and US is reluctant to have leaders in the country. So this is there throttle to that.
2023-08-23 06:38:26|Aditya Agrawal|they bring in*
2023-08-23 06:49:56|Ankesh Atlasian AI|It doesn't matter if there are a lot of investors already, the founder / investor dynamic is still highly skewed in favour of investors, so it is a good thing for founders to have more options.
2023-08-23 06:52:29|‪+91 99020 88930‬|Another axis to think of is whether you would want to give away 10% at zygote stage
2023-08-23 07:04:40|Aditya Agrawal|The best way to decide on an accelerator is to talk to some portfolio companies of theirs. Pick some from recent cohorts and some from at least 3 years before . Talk to them candidly. No one other than them can give specifics.
2023-08-23 07:19:46|~ Rajiv Poddar|Hack your way through it. On B1/B2 you can stay for 6 months at a time. Spend a month or so in SFO every quarter. Build in India and visit frequently.
2023-08-23 07:21:11|Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai|This is the best approach.
2023-08-23 07:54:31|Bhavya e/acc|Have a school friend who's a founder (https://www.obviously.ai/) and has secured the O1 if anyone wishes to chat.
2023-08-23 08:58:51|~ Prashant Singh|Here is what works most of the time : (1) Incorporate a Delaware C Corp (2) establish a fully owned indian sub (3) Show your self an employee of Indian Sub (2) get invite to any of big event (Google IO/ Apple WWDC /Salesforce Dreamforce or get a visa invite from your friend in FAANG on their letterhead (3) Apply for B1 you will get it smoothly (4) make 2-3 trips of one month each  in the first  year that would be sufficient (5) the moment you have 1 Year complete on the payroll of Indian Sub you are eligible for O1 -Inter company transfer (6) Hire a good lawyer it will cost a bit of money but you will get O1 .
2023-08-23 09:01:59|Bhavya e/acc|Interesting. But wouldn't they suspect one is doing this for being eligible for the O1. US has a bed rep with people trying to cut corners (open to be proven wrong.)
2023-08-23 09:04:10|~ Prashant Singh|Law enforcement everywhere is mostly about compliance to the letter of the law not spirit of the law .. that's for court .
2023-08-23 09:06:48|Bhavya e/acc|Who'd risk deportation after spending so much? 
2023-08-23 09:07:02|Bhavya e/acc|Visa*
2023-08-23 09:08:13|"~ Pratiksha | Graphia.AI"|why not just be employee of delware c corp & show 1 year payroll?
2023-08-23 09:09:20|~ Prashant Singh|some accounting and payroll thing .
2023-08-23 09:15:38|Aditya Agrawal|quick question: Is anyone looking to apply and move at this point? or are we just sharing these for the sake of sharing?
2023-08-23 09:22:58|Mayank Gupta|Also the additional question if anyone has any experience to share - Is it worth it? Are there significant differences in any of the aspects of company building (hiring, raising etc) and which ones apart from there being a larger access of businesses to sell to? ‎<This message was edited>

2023-08-23 09:30:22|~ Prashant Singh|I am not sure if i understand . Are you asking is there any benefit of a presence in US other than sales close fast
2023-08-23 09:31:11|Mayank Gupta|Sorry corrected it to make it more explanatory - but yeah that's what I was trying to ask
2023-08-23 09:34:19|~ Prashant Singh|YMMV but I think almost everything gets better there other than living conditions ( crime /rent ) and Runway (cost burn ). you think differently ..don't reinvent a lot of stuff. in general, dealing with smart-driven ppl is good . Plust face time helps in closing the round .
2023-08-23 09:40:42|Bhavya e/acc|I am curious now - do Indian founders create enterprises as a means to shift to US? 🤔
2023-08-23 09:42:10|Aditya Agrawal|This is valuable I’ll try this
2023-08-23 09:42:59|Aditya Agrawal|But probably with H1
2023-08-23 09:45:48|Bhavya e/acc|This might be such a turn down for people funding them. How does one identify such ventures and founders? Any VC/seasoned angel would like to weigh in?
2023-08-23 09:48:05|~ Prashant Singh|this is not what it is about : Founders want to make global business . one thing which help is to have a presence in US .
2023-08-23 09:48:44|Aditya Agrawal|[PHONE] are these random questions or you building something?
2023-08-23 09:50:22|~ Prashant Singh|Please dont worry about VCs.  They often reco to  have company in Delaware /martitus /singapore / Dubai . Incorporation / Stock issuance / Closing down , liquidation everything is more smooth that way .

2023-08-23 18:53:21|Neha Nupoor Yc|Ours was the cheapest btw. Since the regulations have changed it's become trickier if you dont want to go the LLp route

2023-08-23 18:57:37|Neha Nupoor Yc|At Uber, voice from India was quite high. Indians cant use english keyboards and cheaper phone dont make it easy to type. Voice is preferred
2023-08-23 18:57:59|Neha Nupoor Yc|Even for children voice is the bigger mode of interaction since they cant type

2023-08-25 12:30:34|Sahir AI|hi , you mean for training images , you wanted AI generated images of diseased animals?
2023-08-25 12:36:36|Anubhav Mishra AI|Hey, you can try with specific prompts I guess, it's a very specific use case.
2023-08-25 12:39:26|‪+91 85609 53375‬|We have faced the same issue with plants earlier. This was before Midjourney happened. Tried GAN but the classification results were bad with the artifically generated images against the real images. We actually went on to work on a different classification model architecture that worked with uneven dataset.
2023-08-25 13:47:01|~ Kshitij Agrawal|You can possibly generate 10-20% of data, maybe if you are able to identify a good prompt / inpainting or img2img strategy. The additional risk is going to be the domain difference b/w generated images vs real. 
2023-08-25 14:13:48|Anubhav Mishra AI|[PHONE] here is an idea, not sure if it work, if the disease is something that make changes in the appearance physically ( identified by symptoms) you can specially mentions those in the prompt.

2023-08-26 17:57:16|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|I am asking for benchmarks from other folks, that's not promotion. Sharing a webinar link for a single company is 😊 
2023-08-26 17:59:41|Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright|As fine tuning becomes more popular, it would be easier to have a shared base model and decoupled additive models. Hopefully that leads to a reduced cold start problem
2023-08-26 18:00:41|Dev Aggarwal AI|One hacky solution is to swap models between ram and gpu, that way you can pack many models into a machine with limited gpu memory and still get nice cold starts since moving between gpu and ram is fast.

2023-08-26 18:04:43|Dev Aggarwal AI|> Our solution is Parameter Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) [1], which freezes most weights during finetuning, only updating small subsets of weights, called adapters, using backpropagation. The adapters only need 10-30MB storage instead of tens of GBs for the entire model ‎<This message was edited>

2023-08-27 10:42:39|Divya Tak Ai|One of the challenges here, might be that it is hard to capture intended usecase and behaviour so the ai would struggle to translate the design to code effectively

2023-08-28 09:24:30|Ankur Pandey Longshot|[PHONE] (recently raised 3m seed)
2023-08-28 09:25:36|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|Seed rounds shouldn't be less than $4.4M
2023-08-28 09:26:00|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|But depends on a lot of factors

2023-08-28 10:14:10|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Question: Are these seed numbers coming from Indian VCs and US VCs different?
2023-08-28 10:15:42|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|I just want to honestly know as It helps me to plan mine. I am completely unware of Indian VC space.
2023-08-28 10:16:26|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|Take an example
2023-08-28 10:16:35|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|Since seed announcement 😂
2023-08-28 10:17:21|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|I'm also assuming that Indian GenAI startups are being placed to compete with the US ones, as GenAI has no border limitations.
2023-08-28 10:17:45|Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai|Let me elaborate a little bit here - 
2023-08-28 10:19:23|Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai|I think people forget the power of the $1-3M rounds ... Flipkart ($800K), Freshworks ($1M), Zetwerk ($1M), Chargebee ($1M), Swiggy ($2M) ... the high seed round game is a broad generic statement ... it depends on the company and their market.
2023-08-28 10:19:49|Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai|Now folks will argue that to win US market people need minimum $10M
2023-08-28 10:20:05|Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai|And I agree, but to get to PMF you dont need $17M
2023-08-28 10:20:20|Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai|Langchain got $10M after the product was frikking popular.
2023-08-28 10:21:26|Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai|And I don't think $1M (or thereabouts) ARR will get them to their next round of funding
2023-08-28 10:21:36|Anshul Bhide Replit|Llamaindex too - 8.5M
2023-08-28 10:21:42|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|I am no VC but which years were these seed rounds raised?
2023-08-28 10:22:04|Anshul Bhide Replit|And that’s only after they had some idea of PMF
2023-08-28 10:25:51|‪+91 99629 64599‬|You should definitely give this a try. Customers have been able to get production grade output with minimal effort from figma files. Also working closely with figma 
2023-08-28 10:26:08|Aakrit Vaish Haptik AI|For true PMF I don't think any software product needs more than 3-5m no matter what market

2023-08-28 10:28:04|‪+91 99629 64599‬|Interesting passed on to the founder
2023-08-28 10:28:27|Nitin Mahajan 88 Vc|2 cents worth in this debate where there are no answers - raising before having a prototype and some sense of PMF leads to lower capital ask, burn, and number of pivots. SaaS (or micros saas in my case) should be following this approach of get a PMF before asking >2M$. For 100-200k you can frugally run for 6-9 months and get a validation. 
2023-08-28 10:29:40|Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai|I'm inclined to agree but $3-5M is still stretching it - in the last 2 years, have seen companies in B2B get there w/ much less 
2023-08-28 10:30:09|Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai|Raising capital should not depend on which year you raise, but on what the business needs. This is the biggest problem I see today. Companies raise huge rounds $10M for 10% dilution - since some VCs are desperate to put money. Now, next round needs to happen at $200M at least ? Then if you get valued at 10X revenue - you need $20M revenue. I have never seen any SaaS company that has gotten to $20M revenue in $10M raise from seed. 
2023-08-28 10:31:07|Aakrit Vaish Haptik AI|Haan I meant maxxxxx 🙂

2023-08-28 10:33:53|Nitin Mahajan 88 Vc|Fully agree [PHONE]. SaaS isn't a winner take all and PMF doesnt need expensive account managers to be hired in US. Prove karo phir decide karo the GTM scale-up model and capital requirements.
2023-08-28 10:44:44|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|PMF is good in theory, and as founders, no one cares more about PMF than us. But I'm sure many of your current seed investments don't have a PMF. And I'm only talking about GenAI, not Generic SaaS tools, because you can count GenAi companies on your finger that has PMF. So how does the valuation difference work in GenAI.
2023-08-28 10:45:53|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|These Indian founders are asked to come to SF to find customers and be align with what is going on, in that case 200-300K someone mentions won't work.
2023-08-28 11:15:44|Hemant Mohapatra Lightspeed Ai|Interesting discussion :) As a VC who's deployed capital into the US (a16z) and now in India+SEA (Lightspeed), here are my learnings:
2023-08-28 11:21:30|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|Accel & Supabase are different businesses but what stage/raise were they at when they crossed $1M in ARR?
2023-08-28 11:26:00|Hemant Mohapatra Lightspeed Ai|Are you asking the question because you think every company in the world at that scale of ARR should get the same amount of funding correlated to the respective market averages? If yes, fundamentally misaligned with you on principle. If not the, question isn't going to help the group converge to an answer on what's the correct raise size for a company relative to the stage they're at.
2023-08-28 11:26:56|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|Neither. But you didn't answer my question 😊
2023-08-28 11:29:23|Hemant Mohapatra Lightspeed Ai|Accurate observation; because it wasn't going to drive convergence on the topic at hand :)
2023-08-28 11:32:03|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|Off topic: Grateful for the GenAI wave. 5 years ago VC wouldn't share their contacts & would ask you to send an email with the deck
2023-08-28 11:37:27|Aditya Agrawal|[PHONE] : I think SAAS is also a big/good ecosystem in India. And we have seen founder + VC come together to solve for it.
2023-08-28 11:37:47|Aditya Agrawal|the whole point of community is different set come together to solve for it.
2023-08-28 11:44:16|Swadeep Pillarisetti Wipro|Lovin' this! Brilliant insights. Actually strongly echo with almost every single one of them 
2023-08-28 11:51:33|Swadeep Pillarisetti Wipro|I think the core qs is: how much $ does an early stage Gen AI startup need to attain PMF? $1M-$1.5M, $3-$5M, or higher? On average, US vs India
2023-08-28 12:08:53|Aditya Agrawal|Sir by that time we will already be seeing M&A phase of AI ‎<This message was edited>
2023-08-28 12:10:19|Aditya Agrawal|In India, we have 1000+ AI Founders and there are only top 3-4 VC firms from which everyone wants to raise for all the good and known reasons in the community.

2023-08-28 12:21:18|Swadeep Pillarisetti Wipro|Most of which will be less than 2 years old, maybe even 12 months old. 
2023-08-28 12:22:07|Aditya Agrawal|How long you think it takes for Startups to find a PMF?
2023-08-28 12:37:33|Swadeep Pillarisetti Wipro|Less than a year but many times longer
2023-08-28 12:38:39|Swadeep Pillarisetti Wipro|Again, you didn't answer my qs here. Leading to my qs: do we have enough data to reach a reasonable conclusion

2023-08-29 07:33:26|‪+91 99458 85649‬|On point 1, let me tell a story. Back in 2003, I was building a product that was going to cut hardware design capture from 8 months to 4 weeks or less. Everything was going amazing, smashing demos, paid pilots with large players like IBM, Apple, etc, even got a couple of awards for best product in the domain. Went to the market, and suddenly, there were no takers. Took a long time to figure it out, which we eventually did. The point is that PMF is hard to gauge. Is 1st 10 paid customers PMF, or 1st 1M dollars, or a survey of 100 potential customers giving thumbs up. Recently, I worked with a startup doing $20 million ARR, but everyone internally agrees that PMF is yet to be achieved.
2023-08-29 08:10:04|~ Rajiv Poddar|1/ PMF would be high mom growth on OpenAI bill. 
2023-08-29 08:14:15|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Only Nvidia is the GenAI company, everyone else is a wrapper.
2023-08-29 08:29:43|Dev Aggarwal AI|1/ If you’re in b2c you’ll just know from your stripe graph & happy emails from people. In b2b its I think the repeat renewal is a good sign, but its much more complex and you have to really talk to the individuals at the other company to figure out what’s going on.

2023-09-01 00:36:33|Dev Khare Lightspeed|Thx Anshuman. Doing this fundamental work to get past the hype and figure where actual dollars are coming from. I suspect it is microsoft itself (perhaps reciprocal on cloud), tech/saas companies, full stack services wrapped around AI (eg marketing, legal) and some consumer use cases (media, entertainment). Direct enterprise spend is mostly POCs still, I'm  hearing.  Any leads from you all to figure this out, we are happy to follow up on. We will publish our findings once we get there.
2023-09-01 00:39:57|Dev Khare Lightspeed|(And this work we are doing applies not just to OpenAI and text oriented FMs but also other companies as well as video and audio uses from OpenAI, Midjourney, Cohere  Stability, etc)

2023-09-01 08:26:08|‪+91 99458 85649‬|Isnt the $1Bn projection future looking with a 12 month horizon. In Dec 2022, OpenAI projected $1Bn by end 2024. The projection that came out a few days back is also 12 months in future and pretty much on similar time lines (maybe 1 quarter accelerated). I would assume a lot of this would be enterprise sales projections as thats where lot of action is happening. From what I hear, its a lot around automating conversations (chatbots) and enterprise search still as most enterprises chased that in 2017-18 but couldnt get much out of it then. Enterprises want to see that succeed first.

2023-09-01 09:38:06|Shashwatv1 Consumableai|Nice. So enterprise offerings will be expensive for startups and small-caps. Creating a lot of room for new incumbents at 15-30$/m/u
2023-09-01 09:41:08|Shashwatv1 Consumableai|The other thing that sabotages this is : platform's (AWS/ GCP/ Azure/ Apple/ X's) own LLM offerings. Yet to see anything as predicatable and reliable for biz workflows as chatgpt4.5.

2023-09-23 12:28:17|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|Why AI?
2023-09-23 13:10:52|‪+91 98201 07378‬|I can respond as a professional investor, or I can respond as myself: somebody who loves to learn and build. The answer is the same in both cases. AI is going to be an important propeller of human progress.

2023-09-27 18:21:59|Deepanshu Valley AI|Can anyone share some general insights on revenue % share range you would likely give to your 1st founding engineer for a seed stage startup?
2023-09-27 18:22:54|Anubhav Mishra AI|Go with ESOPs bro why revenue share
2023-09-27 18:27:08|‪+91 99000 64551‬|Depends on a lot of params, but I think 1-5%, if you have a prototype and some business already. 
2023-09-27 18:28:01|‪+91 99000 64551‬|Rest, I think some VCs or investors might be able to guide you better with market comps.
2023-09-27 18:28:37|‪+91 99000 64551‬|Oops. This is for ESOP, not rev share.
2023-09-27 18:34:17|Deepanshu Valley AI|What about revenue share number estimates?
2023-09-27 18:45:18|‪+91 99000 64551‬|I don't know. But if I had to do something like rev share, I would do quarterly/annual bonus, payout of bonus would be basis revenue milestones (Instead of direct rev share).  And then defining that becomes easy, because you are doing salary+bonus w.r.t to his market comp.
2023-09-27 18:46:01|‪+91 99000 64551‬|%rev share for a founding engineer would not be sustainable in long term.

2023-09-28 05:36:46|Shashwatv1 Consumableai|That's what I mean by platform risk. So unless a new tool is not integrating with multiple clouds, dbs, chat msgs etc. It becomes hard for a new incumbents to compete with the platforms on the similar AI features. This wasn't necessarily the case with non-AI features. AI is priority everywhere hence conflict of interest ‎<This message was edited>
2023-09-28 05:38:07|Nitin Mahajan 88 Vc|Yup. Either be super niche, cross-platform, or so boring that no one cares about you (and you keep quiet haha)

2023-10-19 12:05:50|Sai Sharan Tangeda Hyderabad Ai|Is openai still giving out credits? Is there a standard protocol for this or do we need go via some partner?
2023-10-19 15:26:44|‪+91 85609 53375‬|Try from Microsoft for Startup
2023-10-19 15:30:17|‪+91 6380 021 838‬|We recently got a grant. Would be happy to help you on this.
2023-10-19 15:32:10|Aryaman (Repello AI)|Yeah pretty simple, can easily get $2500 worth of OpenAI API creds, and more if you're a registered startup
2023-10-19 15:38:57|~ Bharath|Registered = incorporated as a PLC or LLP?

2023-10-19 16:13:50|Aryaman (Repello AI)|Not sure about YC startup program, I got using Microsoft for Startups
2023-10-19 16:53:41|Shanoop Krishnan Microsoft Sales|I believe you can go upto 30k on Azure OpenAI credits, provided you graduate to the highest tier of MFS program.

2023-10-21 16:48:21|‪+91 85609 53375‬|You will be using Azure's OpenAI service in one case and OpenAI's service in the other case.
2023-10-21 16:50:06|‪+91 85609 53375‬|I don't know if someone else has experienced it but felt that Azure's OpenAI call for GPT-3.5 is much faster than OpenAI. Though they have some content filtering up which will abruptly block few calls and requires further approval.

2023-10-21 19:06:56|Ankur Pandey Longshot|I wouldn't be the best judge. It was like the animated YT you see. But it was designed as a support bot for energy management application
2023-10-21 19:09:40|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Got it. Still Amazing if it works for real-time interactions considering the language part. I asked as I thought some real-time leap sync model was at play for the animation.

2023-10-23 08:18:00|‪+91 98201 07378‬|it’s not a science - it’s basically dictated by the amount of demand there is to fund that particular startup. pedigree of founders (experience, quality) is the most important consideration at that stage
2023-10-23 08:20:09|‪+91 98201 07378‬|you also don’t want to dilute too much at that stage - investors will question founder motivation if they only own a small chunk of the startup by the time it’s at a Series A or B stage
2023-10-23 08:20:59|‪+91 98201 07378‬|10-15% dilution is good. TLDR; no formula for valuing pre seed companies, only vibes
2023-10-23 08:21:08|Jibin Sabu E2E|but its really hard not to dilute <15%  as well. Pre Product, Pre revenue esp in AI involves higher risk as well ‎<This message was edited>

2023-10-23 17:23:04|~ Aakash Kambuj|I’d question why you’d want to raise at pre-seed, vs bootstrapping or raising a seed directly once you have a prototype with 2-3 design partners?

2023-10-23 17:37:44|Aryaman (Repello AI)|Surely valid for the majority SaaS kind of companies, but in spaces like FinTech, where getting the regulatory license becomes existential for the company, it does make sense to raise a SAFE note and reach the seed stage.
2023-10-23 17:41:12|~ Aakash Kambuj|Why not do the regulatory license work after raising the seed? Is it a pre-requisite?
2023-10-23 17:42:28|~ Aakash Kambuj|There’s nothing particularly special about a pre-seed other than a new milestone made up by investors who did not have check sizes that could stand up to increasing seed-stage check sizes from deeper-pocketed investors

2023-10-30 11:59:10|Shikhil Kumar Gupta Ai|But is the virtual address reliable? I have seen that ROC can visit anytime at your registered office, if they dont find Books of accounts ...then will charge you with penalty for non compliance of company act.
2023-10-30 12:00:58|~ Saurabh Karn|Very unlikely.. there are around 14 lakh registered companies in India. To ensure that address is legit, ROC time to time asks you to submit strange things. For example, stand in front of the office holding the a printout of your company name and CIN and submit with lat lng that kind of things.
2023-10-30 12:01:03|~ Saurabh Karn|We work works actually

2023-10-30 12:02:54|~ Jackie|My strong suggestion. Don't do a virtual address thing. It's kind of illegal from what I last heard and yes I know a few startups who've gotten into problems because of the visits that have happened.
2023-10-30 12:02:59|~ Jackie|Better to do a 1 seater office space

2023-10-30 13:22:33|‪+91 99000 64551‬|I doubt investors perceive better brand value if you have a virtual address that they recognize. It just means you are burning a little more money.

2023-10-31 13:02:44|~ Kishore M R|We can apply ourseIves IMHO. Not so complex. StartupIndia seed fund SISF has a central web portal that one can choose an incubator and apply to them. Remember LLP or private ltd not more than 2 yrs of regn  is a base criteria..Grants upto 20L and convertible equity for upto 50 L are given through those incubators. AFAIK only software products are not considered in most govt schemes. Some physical product or part of the product be physical is expected. Not sure of such a restriction with SISF. NASSCOM has an incubator and they may probably help. Based on my experiences with these schemes, if there is a physical product or a part atleast these schemes are useful to collect a lot of grants. If there is a team member exclusively looking into it, then atleast 1-2Crs can be taken as grants. All such schemes are time consuming, not very transparent not to rely it on for any immediate investment or working capital. A sizeable number of people who know how this system works just propose ideas or PoCs  one after another and get the money as their revenue stream and never go to market. The schemes are good but there are loopholes and challenges for someone who is betting against time. ‎<This message was edited>

2023-11-09 11:08:19|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|The thing is that their current efforts are for photo ops. 2-3 months and things will fall apart as usual.

They did not pay anyone nor did they have any relatives in the committee or team . Yes - it does take time to complete the process , but the newer schemes have set SLAs.and track it well .
2023-11-09 11:22:12|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|You’re right as I don’t have enough experience to generalize, however the field is moving fast and as a startup, time is very precious these days. This may work for traditional startups, but a GenAI startup betting on Gov funds with their timeline, one can end up losing edge in that waiting period.
2023-11-09 11:23:21|Hari Sir|Do not over estimate Angels/ VCs and PEs for quick turnaround. There are only a few exceptions.
2023-11-09 11:24:26|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Unfortunately, that is true too.
2023-11-09 11:26:27|Hari Sir|I would only say that the startup eco system now has several government schemes to back them - they were non existent a few years ago . ‎<This message was edited>
2023-11-09 11:28:33|Hari Sir|Uniphore , Dehaat , Phool , Noccarc and many such companies have benefited from government schemes at some point of time in their startup journey .
2023-11-09 11:29:30|Hari Sir|If you look at the Biotech space , most startups look up to BIRAC since no angels typicall invest in the sector .
2023-11-09 11:30:19|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|All of these startups have longer product cycle and slow moving tech.
2023-11-09 11:31:01|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|GenAI, which we focus in this group, I would say is totally unprecedented.

2023-11-23 18:35:41|‪+91 99000 64551‬|AFAIK, they will need to register a company OR be in some incubator/accelerator somehow which grants credits. (Not sure if that also requires registered company).

2023-11-23 18:38:27|Enkrypt.ai Prashant AI|Depends on how compute intensive the needs are.

2023-11-24 14:59:31|‪+91 99458 85649‬|Setting a PLC is about Rs 20-30k for authorized capital upto 10lacs.

2023-12-24 07:41:42|Ankesh Atlasian AI|I used to work in voice conversational AI for several years and had flirted with this idea for inbound and outbound call centers to have human-like conversations with customers. This was before chatgpt era. Do you think this prospect may be ripe now?

2023-12-25 08:17:16|Deepak Ai|Have spent some time exploring this space. My take: call centres will consolidate further, small call centres will be disrupted by large ones. Large call centres won't be disrupted by tech companies. Thought process: 1) Call centres already have distribution, they'll be able to build tech(which is very much democratized rn) sooner than tech companies build distribution 2) Mostly processes are outsourced, not just calls. And to complete the process you'll always need humans to fill up for edge cases and escalation, which these call centres already have.
2023-12-25 08:23:01|~ Kshitij Agrawal|Is it a small space though? As call center automation increases it could start creating new categories.. 
2023-12-25 08:23:36|Priyank Agrawal|Intersting take. Are you an investor or a builder??
2023-12-25 08:24:18|Deepak Ai|Builder sir 🙏
2023-12-25 08:26:11|~ Chinmay Shah|How about automation of the whole sales process itself (as in the first call) [can see tech being good enough in a few years]? 
2023-12-25 08:26:26|Deepak Ai|Maybe, but these could also become extensions for CRMs.
2023-12-25 08:30:07|Deepak Ai|Despite the perception, I think sales, positioning and marketing has been the differentiator for most companies. Saw somewhere even publicly listed saas companies spend 50-60% on s&m, with tech becoming more and more standard, I feel sales and positioning as differentiator is going to grow stronger. Many parts will be automated no doubt, but with automations that'll become new standard and people will build on top of it to differentiate. So don't see end to end sales automation at all. Could be horrendously wrong 😂

Democratisation/open source models just gives you a good starter point, it isn't the best model out there, still misses out on clumsy things relative to other closed source one's, which won't work for large enterprises. ‎<This message was edited>

2024-01-03 17:08:26|Priyank Agrawal|Very sad honestly. Surely they could have done decently well with a hosted api service (I was a subscriber and they shut it down 2-3 months ago). It's pretty obvious OAI launching at 1/10th the price of their hosted api effected that strategy. But they recently pivoted to do 365 usd commerical license for just the model (no GPU cost for them). Idk why they dint continue that it would have been decent I think.
2024-01-03 17:39:07|Nitin Mahajan 88 Vc|Very much curious to know what happened here. They had a huge head start in what’s arguable a tech play.

2024-02-26 07:34:59|Nitin Mahajan 88 Vc|paddle and lemonsquuezy are good options.

2024-03-04 06:16:37|Aditya Agrawal|All, We have access to some of the top folks at Meity in case you ever face a problem on any regulation or deployment. Please connect. 
2024-03-04 06:17:31|Aditya Agrawal|This is in regards to recent developments in the policy space.
2024-03-04 06:24:57|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|Before worrying about approval or regulations, first step should be creating a structure or a think tank or whatever name they call it these days.
2024-03-04 06:26:27|Kartik Springworks|can we get clarity on who it applies for? What does it mean?
2024-03-04 06:31:03|Shashank B AI|Nasscom and other industry bodies are meant to interface (lobby) with government
2024-03-04 06:38:52|Yash Wadgave Ai Tisac|Is it beneficial or detrimental to startup’s pace or innovation??
2024-03-04 07:02:55|Aditya Agrawal|I think its too early to comment
2024-03-04 07:03:05|Ankesh Atlasian AI|Where do startups log a ticket for review?
2024-03-04 07:04:53|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|How many startup founders have a voice in it? Should I focus on customer acquisition and product or lobbying?
2024-03-04 07:05:19|Aditya Agrawal|[PHONE] 😀
2024-03-04 07:05:54|~ Sandesh|+1. Need a pressure group. Fintech does a decent job (with all its faults). Not sure how to go about building it though. Should it be a subset of NASSCOM? Something from scratch? Are there other options?
2024-03-04 07:06:04|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|My voice is heard by Elon Musk’s platform.
2024-03-04 07:06:49|~ Sandesh|It's too early to know if they are serious about it, but if they are, such regulation always helps the incumbents and large companies. The cost of compliance will be too high for startups
2024-03-04 07:09:06|‪+91 96773 42267‬|The whole reason this began is because Gemma called Modi a fascist. And that goes against the IT act’s Rule 3 (1) (b), about misinformation.
2024-03-04 07:09:35|‪+91 96773 42267‬|Which is why they introduced this ruling so urgently.
2024-03-04 07:10:45|‪+91 96773 42267‬|I don’t think it’s a legal requirement as of yet, though. To register your model or whatever.

2024-03-04 07:58:08|Sai Sharan Tangeda Hyderabad Ai|Way too early to see this as positive or negative
2024-03-04 08:01:36|~ Kishore M R|"It is  hurried  just giving a plain statement like ""take permission"" . It could be an announcement telling we work on regulations and bring in stakeholders. It's a knee jerk reaction"
2024-03-04 08:02:20|Sai Sharan Tangeda Hyderabad Ai|Yup 😂. That’s the error they’ve made. Causing unnecessary panic cross country
2024-03-04 08:02:38|~ Kishore M R|The voices should be as early as possible. No point in waiting. Even if they are testing waters, our stand matters
2024-03-04 08:05:04|Kiran Ai Group Koppula Un|From a layman point of view, trying to see how regulation can help the outcome. Is it technologically possible to regulate the outcomes.

2024-03-04 17:20:03|~ Rajesh Parikh|Essentially, it's saying implicitly before you become too big, you better test it out, define terms of usage, call out statutory risks, before putting it out in the wild. ‎<This message was edited>
2024-03-04 17:22:07|~ Rajesh Parikh|Controversial nature of the event that brought this particular regulatory overreach on an ecosystem which is yet in its seed. There are red flags here otherwise.
2024-03-04 17:23:27|~ Rajesh Parikh|Model Startups may have to trade off speed for testing, if putting it out in public or other strategies like private beta testing. ‎<This message was edited>
2024-03-04 17:24:33|~ Rajesh Parikh|But I expect this to be not an isolated event and may be good to factor in.
2024-03-04 17:33:37|~ Rajesh Parikh|Pratik's point on testing resources is critical. There's much needed collaboration both commerical and open source particularly in domain/task specific evaluations. Evaluation test suites, bench marks and  accessibility of eval datasets (domain/task specific) will become critical for ecosystem to reduce cost of testing and evaluation. ‎<This message was edited>

2024-03-07 23:37:39|Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group|I agree, I think more folks from Academia in India should consider starting up
2024-03-09 06:27:58|Aditya Agrawal|I think more startups should find a way to partner with academia.. and more academia should realize value in working with startups than large enterprise. ‎<This message was edited>
2024-03-09 06:36:26|Lalit Vijay|We have tried to work out with some leading academia, academic institutions are looking at these opportunities as just side projects with little attention. The primary objective is making some money for individuals + unrealistic gain sharing in case of +ve outcome with little emphasis on how   research work can be aligned with industry. ‎<This message was edited>

2024-03-14 07:28:45|Enkrypt.ai Prashant AI|In my opinion for the rows: AI maturity and model selection will depend on whether the startup is deeptech, b2b and b2c. It might be their model that is the moat at the beginning stages for a deeptech company.
2024-03-14 07:31:00|Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai|From India typically hard for companies to raise a lot of capital to pre-train models. So I think better to establish that customers are willing to pay for what you want to sell, then once you raise more capital get to custom pre-train models.

2024-03-14 08:03:58|Enkrypt.ai Prashant AI|Exactly. Finding customer need is above all. For a deeptech startup - in our case, our clients want better than open-source solutions. Exactly to your point, we had very different conversations and focus areas when we were working on sabu.ai and now when we are building enkryptai - common is focusing on customer needs.
2024-03-14 08:49:49|Dr. Pratik Desai Ai|A lot of cost is also associated with the data curation task. While the pre-training cost for customer-specific or vertical models will keep getting lower compared to SoTA models, the curation can be more than 50%* of the total cost

2024-04-02 07:00:45|Priyank Agrawal|Amazon's ecommerce is exempted thus they usually get away with it.

2024-04-02 07:04:21|Pramod Ai Hyd|Not aware of the exemption but I guess it’s based on the message you convey in the app, AFAIK it’s prohibited to have a button/CTA to redirect to mobile web for purchase, but having an explicit message instead of a CTA works

2024-04-25 13:46:29|~ Vamshi|The downside of course is that Inventus fees are way more expensive and will only be worth it if you are close to raising funds or some other event which absolutely requires incorporation.
2024-04-25 13:53:29|~ Harsh Gupta|Also firstbase and doola both are for setting an LLC, if you plan to raise money at some point, you need to have a C-Corp.

2024-04-25 13:57:03|~ Rajiv Poddar|What's the exactly issue with FEMA compliance though?
2024-04-25 13:58:14|~ Vamshi|There used to be a way until a year or so ago, when it was possible to issue shares from the U.S. entity to the India founders directly, while still being compliant.
2024-04-25 13:59:08|~ Vamshi|There was a change to FEMA regulations around that time which made that approach non compliant (I think gifted shares or some equivalent).
2024-04-25 14:00:53|~ Vamshi|Now you have to use an indirect approach by setting up an LP here that invests into the U.S. entity, something like that.
