2023-03-03 08:27:13,"Was thinking more data localisation and compliance needs, not cost"
2023-03-03 12:15:01,"+ control…If you need to train specialized models, can’t yet do it with chatGPT. Also once LLMs start to call APIs which access sensitive data, we might need different, transparent and configurable/ finetunable base models."

2023-03-03 15:11:49,Ummm have they released some code?
2023-03-03 15:12:18,I am very skeptical on this. Data from brain to be used for useful things is still in very very early research.
2023-03-03 15:12:27,"Nahi, it's not peer reviewed. Just submitted to some conf I think."

2023-03-03 15:12:58,You're bringing facts to an emo excited conversation. Why you be like this?
2023-03-03 15:13:12,Coz I have spent a lot of money and time on this 😂
2023-03-03 15:13:23,My rant is my emo :P
2023-03-03 15:13:28,Please elaborate further
2023-03-03 15:13:51,😂😂😂 
2023-03-03 15:13:55,I have bought some 4 such devices over 4 years
2023-03-03 15:14:01,Each costing 25k to 1L :P
2023-03-03 15:14:11,And I was a subject in one such experiment too
2023-03-03 15:14:27,And the data is so noisy and hard to use.
2023-03-03 15:14:42,Like the ones used in hospitals was benchmark for off the shel devices
2023-03-03 15:14:49,"those have 200 probes, you have to be bald"
2023-03-03 15:14:56,and then also it is noisy.
2023-03-03 15:15:08,It works on voltage of neurons. So probes need to be very ver sensitive
2023-03-03 15:15:13,Which is a hard hardware problem
2023-03-03 15:16:29,"They are using fMRI data which has a much stronger signal profile. I participated in a couple of frontal lobe activation expts here, and the data was apparently clean enough to run some pretty interesting analyses."
2023-03-03 15:18:05,Can't we get such data without having a hardware device ?
2023-03-03 15:18:34,That's a near-certain no.
2023-03-03 15:19:39,"What does clean enough and analyses mean here? If it's alright with you, share a couple of examples?"
2023-03-03 15:20:03,I will try and find the paper.
2023-03-03 15:24:57,Non-invasive devices are already pretty noisy compared to brain probes. Without hardware matlab kya?
2023-03-03 15:25:27,"In the meanwhile, the expt was as follows: two sessions of 45 min- 1hr wherein a volunteer (me and 10 others) will lie in an fMRI machine, and solve some logic and language puzzles (they will be projected on a screen and I have to verbalize my answer). They showed me the processed data stream sometime later, and explained that they were going to try and localize activations and their strengths to understand which subsection of the frontal lobe is responsible for the thought. After that, they had planned to run some time-series analyses to see how the activation shifts as the answer is obtained and verbalised (not sure if they ever published this one)."
2023-03-03 17:06:41,"Folks, what are the best videos/resources on using SD for designers (product, UX) and artists? "
2023-03-03 17:07:01,"(Yes, I've already included the anime which plays rock, paper)"
2023-03-03 17:15:00,Automatic1111 is the easiest way to use SD and all of its plugins but requires a GPU to run on local. Plus the setup can be a bit technical. If no GPU then it has to run on Colab which is also technical.

2023-03-06 15:57:01,"really interesting points. @919742807278 you guys used pinecone and langchain in the hasura bot for the embedding purpose only, right?"
2023-03-06 15:59:11,Embedding and prompt templating
2023-03-06 15:59:17,But embedding was the biggest reason
2023-03-06 16:00:40,Any specific reason for not using the openai's embedding endpoint other than cost and latency?
2023-03-06 16:00:54,It uses openAI embedding
2023-03-06 16:01:02,Pinecone is used as vector store
2023-03-06 16:01:06,oh ok
2023-03-06 16:01:11,Yeah that's what I would assume
2023-03-06 16:01:15,Langchain gives a good abstraction
2023-03-06 16:02:09,"Cool cool, haven't used it yet. I thought it might be some kind of local store creator (if that makes sense 😅)"

2023-03-14 12:36:55,"This is left to jury's discretion. I'm not aware of it either, nor will I be till the day of hackathon. The jury may choose to share it, after the demos or make it quantitative."

2023-03-14 12:38:25,"At least devs competing will know what they are going to be judged on, right?"
2023-03-14 12:38:57,And will be helpful for the jury as well on what to look for

2023-03-14 22:53:58,Yeah this is crazy. The train just does not stop
2023-03-14 22:55:29,Seems enterprise grade security/Scalability costs premium😅
2023-03-14 22:56:04,12 cents per 1K token completions is quite expensive — this is going to encourage Llama-Alpaca experiments even more
2023-03-14 22:56:12,GPT4 capabilities have a FOSS counterpart from Amazon: github.com/amazon-science/mm-cot
2023-03-14 22:57:05,The be my eyes demo is hilarious 😂

2023-03-15 02:03:22,After seeing the OpenAI demo
2023-03-15 02:04:21,the paper wireframe to working code was just 🤯
2023-03-15 02:05:42,"But wouldn't this get used more than anything else? who doesn't have to check email, write docs / make slides"
2023-03-15 02:09:09,I agree. It doesn’t open up loads of possibilities for others to build upon- but enough productivity & note apps are irrelevant after this.
2023-03-15 02:13:35,Loved the wireframe to code demo by OpenAI today
2023-03-15 02:14:05,Really good demos
2023-03-15 09:41:36,Hello! 
2023-03-15 09:42:25,Will also request other experts hiding in the weeds to lend their expertise around StableDiffusion: @917407651462 @919619491715
2023-03-15 09:59:33,Last paper I read on Deep Learning/NLP was Attention Is All You Need.
2023-03-15 10:07:04,I would highly recommend watching Karpathy's nonogpt video. 2 hours of golden content. He basically reproduces the same paper you read from scratch.
2023-03-15 10:07:16,[Beginner Researcher Answer]
2023-03-15 10:08:31,The other way is to work backwards from what is out there and we can study e.g. everything from Llama to Flan-T5 and see what blocks they've been built on
2023-03-15 10:10:16,Do you think Xavi Amatriain's catalog is a good read for starters?
2023-03-15 10:12:01,"That can be a bit overwhelming for someone who was last reading BERT-era papers. I mean, even Contrastive Learning is a new concept there in a way. "
2023-03-15 10:12:21,"But if you do this for a living, you should most def use that as a starting point"
2023-03-15 10:17:12,Re-iterating: Non-technical Qs most welcome. They also are good prompt for someone to elaborate and spark and idea :)
2023-03-15 10:28:49,transformers have taken over the field which was dominated primarily by RNN variants. Are we seeing signals of any new architecture doing the same with transformers?
2023-03-15 10:32:45,On a slightly different tangent 
2023-03-15 10:41:40,"With my limited understanding, I think fine-tuning any LLM is quite tricky."

2023-03-15 10:42:29,What do you think about trlx re: PPO? 
2023-03-15 10:51:42,"My very spicy, uninformed take is that we'll see model sizes, personalities, flavours spread across the spectrum of use cases like we did for DBs."
2023-03-15 10:53:20,"Do we think finetuning is needed for most of the usecases? Or just clever prompt engineering is the way to go? The way I am thinking about this is finetuned model is someone who has learned and internalised the concepts vs prompt optimisation with relevant context is someone intelligent reading interesting information and inferring outputs based on it? And for most cases I feel someone smart reading correct information and responding based on that would be sufficient. Do we think that for applications, prefix / prompt tuning is the way to go than finetuning base models (for applications; for open source LLMs, we will need instruction tuning) ?"
2023-03-15 10:53:20,"For artists (non-tech) looking for _prompt to art_ experiments, what is the next step after playing with basic prompts on Midjourney & Dall-e? Do you recommend just going deep with those two platforms, or is there something else that works better?"
2023-03-15 10:53:21,Alex from Carper AI is presenting this tonight at W&B conference. So I'll wait till then and discuss tomorrow.
2023-03-15 10:54:41,Playgroundai
2023-03-15 10:55:28,Prompt optimisation looks more lucrative as the possible size of prompt is now much bigger. Would we train smaller models which will generate better prompts for the underlying LLMs ?
2023-03-15 10:56:34,"Stable Diffusion gives you a lot more control, power and flexibility. See civitai.com (NSFW!) for all the styles and themes you can create around. You might also want to checkout a couple of Youtube artists using this really well for prompt to art: youtube.com/@sebastiankamph is my fav at the moment"

2023-03-15 11:05:51,"Prompt engineering also changes with each new release, the system gets better at understanding what the user is looking for"

2023-03-15 13:14:52,"Most research shows that bigger the model, more the number of emergent properties. Are there any works that show when these arise during training? Do they arise gradually one by one as we train or do they all come up early and become better as we train?"

2023-03-17 00:31:53,"Haven't done any performance tests yet, so don't have much idea about that. The integration is still missing some indexing steps, but from what I've seen, specific vector database like pinecone will have better results in case of large scale applications."

2023-03-17 10:40:02,Training involves curating a dataset which is a lot of effort. The dataset they used to train on was curated till 2021.
2023-03-17 10:40:34,"Cleaning the data, wrangling it etc take a LOT of time"
2023-03-17 10:57:47,Does each llm build their own dataset from scratch 
2023-03-17 11:37:52,Afaik gpt4 cut off is aug 22
2023-03-17 11:43:33,there are some open source datasets

2023-03-18 18:49:24,They're not good enough
2023-03-18 18:49:28,Openjourney is pretty bad
2023-03-18 18:49:32,Protogen has many versions.
2023-03-18 18:49:40,Each with some good and some bad.
2023-03-18 18:49:44,None of them lol
2023-03-18 18:49:51,I've tried all

2023-03-20 17:40:16,What is a static? Image? Text?
2023-03-20 17:44:20,Hey Kishore!
2023-03-20 17:44:34,Excited to see what you have so far.
2023-03-20 17:51:49,Hi Kishore! Welcome to the group. Curious about the images you posted. Are they examples of what a static image is or output from your product's pipeline?
2023-03-20 17:53:38,Hi @919619491715 . This is the output from my product pipeline.
2023-03-20 17:54:36,Pretty cool! So stable diffusion with some fine tuning magic I would guess?
2023-03-20 17:55:03,"hey, nice to see you here @919500192175, amazing progress from last time we caught up 👍"
2023-03-20 18:00:27,You can do this without finetuning. There are many methods out there which you can implement to get similar results. But it does require a lot of trial and error and breaking apart the typical model. You can change the encoders. and other things in the HF pipeline for it to work.

2023-03-21 09:05:32,Hi @918860117496 the main product here doesn’t vary. The main product isn’t the candle. It is the matchstick box with the person holding it.
2023-03-21 09:08:41,This image should be a better representation @918860117496
2023-03-21 09:13:27,Is that how tools like flair / booth.ai work?
2023-03-21 10:01:59,How do they retain the text? Lora screws it up usually right
2023-03-21 10:29:59,Didn't try it. Will give it a shot
2023-03-21 10:42:14,I think there's some smart img2img + masking going on apart from dreamboothing
2023-03-21 11:05:12,https://bit.ly/hf-nvidia-meetup
2023-03-21 11:08:01,"Flair isn't using dreambooth. They are using their own custom trained models, which to my understanding was some sort of mask based, with outpainting. The issues with dreambooth are not only text but also product fidelity. You cannot get the original product fidelity preserved with dreambooth. Also dreambooth required people to custom train models which was very inefficient. better methods have popped up after that. ControlNet, Adapters, Composer(pending release).  finetuning models to my understanding is not needed as of now. You can control, style, image composition, colour scheme without finetuning a model for usecases similar to flair."
2023-03-21 11:32:38,@917737887058 I missed this. Primarily speaking training a model on an object and trying to recreate it during the generation process fails when the product fidelity cannot be compromised. The only method which exists as of today is to start the init image of the pipelines and then create the rest of the image. Even when you do that you can see that the product will get changed because all the SD algorithms work in latent space and not in pixels space. This compression and reconstruction of the image makes it impossible to get the original product image which is present in init image. however the solution is very straightforward . All you need to do is copy paste the pixels on the final image where the product exists. No need for LORA or anything of that sort. 
2023-03-21 11:32:51,Is anywhere working on apps like these : https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35236275
2023-03-21 11:35:07,Worked on document search.
2023-03-21 11:39:43,"Thanks for explaining! I was thinking about this problem statement the other day. What if we take a pic of the product photo in the exact orientation we want, remove the background and inpaint a new one around the product? Haven't tried out Booth ai myself though"
2023-03-21 11:40:09,They are using LLM + embedding approach. Guess they use LangChain as well under the hood.
2023-03-21 11:44:53,Yes this is exactly what I was talking about
2023-03-21 11:46:46,And that's why you will have these differences. This will work for e-commerce folks at all. Especially for high value items like furniture
2023-03-21 11:47:37,it will or won't? My understanding is that it won't work.
2023-03-21 11:48:11,"It definitely WON'T work! Sorry, did a typo in the worst possible place 😅"
2023-03-21 11:52:49,But here's a method that I am reasonably confident WILL work - Users can use a Nerf capture app like Luma to generate a 3D model from any novel viewpoint. It's as easy as walking around a product while taking a video and takes like 30s. Perhaps extract a mesh from the capture because that's easier to render in a browser than Nerf. Then in your product let the user rotate and orient the accurately captured product however they want. Take a snapshot of it without background. Then mask and inpaint like you did.
2023-03-21 11:56:11,This will remove all limitations. Highly accurate and infinite product photo generation from any angle in every aspect ratio for all your visualization needs.
2023-03-21 11:56:24,@919619491715 isnt simple bg subtraction and some bg improvement good enough for ecommerce? :thi
2023-03-21 11:56:50,@919500192175 s images also seemed mostly really smart bg replacement only.
2023-03-21 11:56:58,"@919030126441 you can read up on this as well. https://www.deepset.ai/blog/build-a-search-engine-with-gpt-3 This is by deepset and they have a framework called Haystack. I was looking into it in June of last year, and it's pretty good. Suggest you check it out as well."
2023-03-21 11:57:03,There is a slight halo that is visible if you stare at it long enough 😅
2023-03-21 11:57:20,"Yes, because that is what it is. It is BG replacement."
2023-03-21 11:57:47,I was using similar method too for characters in a scene but this halo hurt the continuity. I am moving to using controlnet for this.
2023-03-21 11:57:56,A lot frankly. But that was mainly cause the original lighting of the image had it and I didn't wan't to spend time to remove it.
2023-03-21 11:58:15,I am using controlnet
2023-03-21 11:58:21,The images are from using controlnet
2023-03-21 11:58:24,Yea. Lighting causes it. Magic brushing with smudge over it removes it usually.
2023-03-21 11:58:33,Ah really. 🤔
2023-03-21 11:58:54,Maybe mine have a halo too. lemme check 😅
2023-03-21 11:59:21,Yes that's the ideal case if you already have the product photo in the exact orientation you want. Real world situation is that product photography is a whole other expensive initiative usually done by a different team. Marketing which creates the final images comes in much later and they have to make do with what they already have. Like there's a whole workflow for this thing.
2023-03-21 11:59:47,^Yea. I was asked to once build a 3D rotating platform to take ecommerce photos :P
2023-03-21 11:59:59,"For constant lighting, bg etc."
2023-03-21 12:00:24,So if you have a 3D capture that the marketing team can put into ANY orientation to generate images that's a big advantage.
2023-03-21 12:00:50,"3D is hard for a lot of use-cases like clothes, grocery no?"
2023-03-21 12:01:15,Your eyes will fall out if I show you Nerf captures of clothes and grocery
2023-03-21 12:02:26,"Hahaha. I have not done nerf but in my freelancing days, number of folks who reached out to me for 3d capture of clothes expecting realistic results was 🙏"
2023-03-21 12:03:01,"And then folks also wanted these clothes to go over humans and look ""natural"""
2023-03-21 12:03:49,"I might even have a long mail explaining ""Cloth Simulation is not a solve problem"". Definitely not in freelancing monies :P"

2023-03-22 10:14:45,Infinite customization is actually a pain. Firefly imo is a great example of limiting functionality and making it more useful than the competitors.
2023-03-22 10:26:21,Pre Firefly Adobe was doing all its ML inference on user's local system? Can anyone confirm?

2023-03-23 13:50:16,Hoping to get a contract with the gates foundation to build a Whatsapp chatbot to guide rural nurses in India. 
2023-03-23 13:58:11,Rural india would need Hindi
2023-03-23 13:58:33,"Hindi is supported by both GPT4 and Whisper, so quite doable"
2023-03-23 13:58:52,Most popular Indian vernacular languages are in fact
2023-03-23 13:59:16,We’re also using bhashini - an indian government funded research project that has a fine tuned whisper model for hindi
2023-03-23 13:59:23,The hindi results of gpt are not as great as english
2023-03-23 13:59:40,Slightly confused then by Bill Gates writing about an Indian startup working on LLMs for Indian languages
2023-03-23 13:59:50,This is probably why
2023-03-23 14:00:29,"Yes, same findings. Plus the source documents are all in English too. Using google translate so that gpt only ever sees english"
2023-03-23 14:01:21,Hmm. Doesn't look like it with GPT4 — original ChatGPT was worse. Using Google Translate would invariably add error. Propose a test set on this — why discuss opinions when we can run experiments!

2023-03-25 18:57:02,What was your workflow? Like what tools did u use?
2023-03-25 19:14:49,Completely using Stable Diffusion. Workflow was first using text2img with controlnet depth map of this image. I got the depth map from Clipdrop's API because it's really good. Thanks to Sudharshan's tweet for this tip! Fixed the red background using this. 
2023-03-25 19:15:30,Do you use automatic1111 for all this? Or just code
2023-03-25 19:16:15,Automatic1111. You would go mad doing this with code 😅
2023-03-25 19:19:00,Makes sense. Have you played around with langchain agents / chatgpt plugins? 
2023-03-25 19:28:45,I think certain things are easier and more fun with a UI - when you need more control and direction a UI would do
2023-03-25 19:29:03,Neat! The depth maps have more control
2023-03-25 19:29:22,"The only problem with this is that you need to run iteration loops in every step until you are satisfied with the output before moving to the next step. Doing 1, 2, 3 successively would not work."
2023-03-25 19:30:14,And this is nothing new for artists: retakes are common
2023-03-25 19:35:58,"Personally what fascinates me more about AI generating art than generating code is how a deterministic input (auto encoder, model weights, controlnet algorithms etc) can give infinite non deterministic output."
2023-03-25 19:37:11,"I believe the non deterministic output still stems from a classical random number generator :) if you keep the seed constant, its very much deterministic."
2023-03-25 19:38:06,Yep
2023-03-25 19:38:28,"Simple but quite useful, the entire concept of seeds"
2023-03-25 19:38:45,To someone who has control over enough constraints the entire universe becomes deterministic

2023-03-27 17:55:29,As per the paper they can't do well. See Aravind's post about contamination: https://aisnakeoil.substack.com/p/gpt-4-and-professional-benchmarks

2023-03-27 18:17:10,"Yeah, not 100% sure of this. There are just so many questions out there, that these newly created questions could just rewording without change in core idea. See Aravind's blog. In my experience with ChatGPT, when I give problems that are easy to medium and then I change the problem ever so slightly in its core idea and it will get it wrong. Or there are tell tale signs it has mugged up. Like I will give a problem that is a coin change in disguise with coins that are multiples of each other.  Thus allows greedy solution, it will provide a DP Solution (I am not even testing for corner cases etc or even if it will run). Just whether the core structure is right, which it did not. So in my experience small perturbations to core idea causes drastic change in correctness."
2023-03-27 18:18:17,Hard questions usually are what differentiates for top ranks (and much fewer) and could just be what people put more effort in creating.

2023-03-27 21:09:58,"Yeah, obviously he'll be baised for his company. But larger point he makes about how people are underestimating potential of LLM powered coding assistants by seeing a few edge case failures of code generation on chatgpt is quite valid. Finetuning LLMs for user's existing codebases + building search capabilities on codebases will be gamechanger"

2023-03-27 21:23:58,"Thanks for sharing. I absolutely think this is monumental and going to change how we work. And working on something using LLMs. Funny thing is the same time, question I asked it is the exact kind of question I would usually ask a fresher to know if they are faking it (as in just knowing the answers mugging up a lot of leetcode answers) or they conceptually know it. I do think lot of the code today we write, will easily to automated too. That begs the question what won't be. All the glue code, all the templates, all the code that is quickly needed to get a project up and running will all be automated. What will possibly remain? So what skills will become more important?"

2023-03-29 22:53:51,And it was a packed house.
2023-03-29 22:54:20,I use a score in interactive sessions. So penalize when it starts to hallucinate. That seems to help. But not in first time prompting. Similarly score for speed seems to help  🤫

2023-03-29 22:58:03,But we can verify if the source is legit or not ? Or does it cite something that might be obscure ?
2023-03-29 22:58:33,And yeah very good one at that. I had it create references with actual researcher in that area of maths. Just that they didn't write the paper (at least not yet or don't know if it had access to data I don't have access to ;)
2023-03-29 22:59:20,Are you using penalty system like the Dan jailbreak? 
2023-03-29 22:59:26,"Depends on the task — for open domain QA, it'll make up very believable stuff and you'll be tripping acid for a while. For closed domain QA, verification is somewhat easier but harder to use this signal."

Nothing Fancy: start with saying you get +1 for producing the output fast and -1 for slow responses. But ensure that you doing when things are bit slow. Last 3-4 days, it adds a disclaimer that it will be slow irrespective but in my experience it was decently fast compared to otherwise."
2023-03-29 23:06:28,"Because if this works, seems like they might be throttling using prompts!! Which just didn't seem right."
2023-03-29 23:11:38,I was thinking of doing something else. Basically you can make a series of questions answer pairs based on the output it gave and then search using serp or other available tools to validate or invalidate the answer. Haven’t tried this out but will do so when I get the time.
2023-03-29 23:12:12,second one does seem to work. will share here if I find any really good solution. was thinking if a custom agent implementation helps which first figures out if this is made up (does induce recursive problem) and then dodges the reply if yes.

2023-03-31 11:25:04,"Hi all,"
2023-03-31 11:26:02,Hi Pradyumna. You can just use the Whisper API to get the transcript. Don't need GPUs
2023-03-31 11:26:08,"You can upload this to gooey doc search too, might take a while. You can select the asr model in settings"
2023-03-31 11:27:19,You can use Colab 
2023-03-31 11:27:50,"Thanks alot, trying this right now"
2023-03-31 11:28:16,"Oh you just needed the transcript. Sorry, that’s at https://gooey.ai/asr/"
2023-03-31 11:29:05,"Oh, thanks! "
2023-03-31 11:29:21,Sure
2023-03-31 11:31:03,"You could even use - https://www.gladia.io/ - 1-hour audio file transcript will be extracted in 10-20 seconds which uses openai Whisper backend. Currently, the API is free."
2023-03-31 11:54:42,"Maybe check out Assembly.ai, they have a playground to upload files to and try transcription, accuracy is pretty good too."
2023-03-31 11:57:00,Checking. I usually use their python API.
2023-03-31 11:58:02,@919039547315 I tried just now with a 50-minute audio file by uploading. It worked fine.
2023-03-31 11:58:26,"Wierd, I'll try again. Thanks"
2023-03-31 12:46:27,Tried on one of the medium blogs and it’s pretty good. Is there a constraint on time limit on the video generated?
2023-03-31 12:51:23,seems like the default is 1 minute
2023-03-31 13:03:09,yes we are generating videos for around 1 minute. There is a limit on size of blog - upto 20k characters
2023-03-31 13:03:28,Is the 1 minute limit because of computation/cost or technical limitations?
2023-03-31 13:03:33,let me check
2023-03-31 13:04:16,"just a product decision for now, since it's free for now - cost is also a reason"
2023-03-31 13:04:40,What'd it take to make a Tiktok/IG reels version of this?
2023-03-31 13:07:24,Or use whisper.cpp
2023-03-31 13:08:39,You mean in terms of only the resolution or is there any other difference
2023-03-31 13:08:58,"Pitch, editing style, cuts, screen transitions, overlays"
2023-03-31 13:09:17,"yes all of that is what i am working on, that is the plan"
2023-03-31 13:10:15,"i mean there are lower hanging fruits then these , but all of these will come.  Making pitch better will happen sooner"

2023-04-02 20:08:26,"I don't have a brief doc written but based on my experience, LoRA works really well compared to other two especially after being trained on small amount of data relatively, followed by dreambooth which would provide decent results after multiple attempts of fine tuning whereas textual inversion did'nt return any good results for me, i did try making small changes but that didn't help much as well."

2023-04-03 02:00:34,"> But it’s very possible that creativity and what we think of us as human intelligence are just an emergent property of a small number of algorithms operating with a lot of compute power (In fact, many respected neocortex researchers believe there is effectively one algorithm for all intelligence.  I distinctly remember my undergrad advisor saying the reason he was excited about machine intelligence again was that brain research made it seem possible there was only one algorithm computer scientists had to figure out.)"
2023-04-03 02:02:05,"> Human brains don’t look all that different from chimp brains, and yet somehow produce wildly different capabilities.  We decry current machine intelligence as cheap tricks, but perhaps our own intelligence is just the emergent combination of a bunch of cheap tricks."

2023-04-05 00:57:28,"One naive approach is if you have graph structure with sentences as nodes, you can use openai embeddings - ""text-embedding-ada-002"" to get node embeddings directly, and using adjacency matric you can compute edge embeddings by averaging the connected nodes."
2023-04-05 00:58:33,Pinterest — the OG graph folks would recommend starting off with any base embedding and then update them  
2023-04-05 01:07:35,I came across this article on HN and was wondering if it can be done using some form of text representation using ‘text-embedding-ada-002’
2023-04-05 02:12:05,Is there a gpt model that i can currently use finetuned with financial data and analysis?
2023-04-05 02:15:37,there's some bloomberg gpt ig
2023-04-05 02:15:53,its not usable yet
2023-04-05 02:15:54,Yeah but I don’t think this is available publicly
2023-04-05 02:16:08,I somehow doubt they will ever open source it
2023-04-05 02:16:11,its just a paper by far
2023-04-05 02:41:33,It’s a paper of an existing /closed implementation- won’t be open sourcing . It’s trained on their proprietary data .
2023-04-05 02:41:42,*sourced
2023-04-05 05:59:13,It works?
2023-04-05 05:59:24,500 lol
2023-04-05 05:59:56,but it's around the corner it seems
2023-04-05 06:00:04,maybe they've rolled it out already to a few people

2023-04-05 18:34:48,"That's the baseline, yeah"
2023-04-05 18:35:19,It would be great if you can give it samples in the prompt itself and perhaps chain it with the system response and then in the second user message send your input query
2023-04-05 18:35:42,Does anyone know how to get more than $1K/month hard limit of OpenAI? We're going to be crossing that any day and I've already applied for an increase.
2023-04-05 18:35:43,Sorry didn't bother with punctuations 😅
2023-04-05 18:35:57,yes / can get very expensive very quickly. 5K questions a day.
2023-04-05 18:38:50,Can it be done by similarity search ? 
2023-04-05 18:38:58,You can perhaps then use gpt4 data do generate your own dataset
2023-04-05 18:39:12,And then train a model of your own labelled dataset
2023-04-05 18:39:20,And use that in prod
2023-04-05 18:39:31,Over engineering friends
2023-04-05 18:39:44,Perhaps :p
2023-04-05 18:40:03,Run this against a decent prompt and see how most of it will just work

2023-04-05 18:42:13,Kudos to you
2023-04-05 18:46:23,The trade off I was considering was using prompt to classify would require a more expensive API end point

2023-04-05 22:06:48,"Funny you should ask, just earlier today I was experimenting with prompt injection out of curiosity. I know that in chatGPT and GPT 3, 3.5, asking it to simulate another agent with different ideals works well. I don't have access to GPT 4 but have heard that this doesn't work well with it. What, in particular, are you interested about in prompt injections?"
2023-04-05 22:07:16,one silly example from my experiments
2023-04-05 22:07:59,thanks. i just want examples which worked before but don't right now in chatgpt-4.

2023-04-05 23:10:08,"I've experimented with GPT-4 and it is really good with handling prompt injections. It sticks to the system prompt and straight up denies such prompt injections methods. Atleast with the experiments I did, I had no luck to get promo injection working with GPT-4. OpenAI seems to have worked well on handling it."
2023-04-06 00:09:34,"I reckon they made good use of the system prompt this time. My guess is that it’s appended at the END of all previous messages and the network is trained to ignore the grammatical content of it, but obey the instructions."
2023-04-06 00:11:42,"Yep, could be the case."

2023-04-06 15:36:23,"I love this constant human urge to decouple systems into memory, reasoning, context and what not — despite 15 years of ML research proving that combined systems outperform decoupled systems. "
2023-04-06 15:36:59,"Sure, so hybrid meaning searching for keywords + semantic meaning. My understanding is that you can use sparse + dense embeddings to achieve better accuracy on results. Pinecone for example allows you to store both of these for a single ID. Wondering if Chroma does the same"
2023-04-06 15:38:25,"Yes, Chroma does the same. They don't have good docs around it yet though. Assuming that you're a hacker solving for time to market, launch with Pinecone. Move to Chroma when someone asks on-premise"
2023-04-06 15:40:02,Combined system definitely will perform better and I feel we are on the verge of achieving this in AI. But as of now it’s clear that memory is a limiting factor of LLMs and hence we need alternative solutions.

2023-04-06 15:44:24,"The most basic model is to use sklearn's CountVectorizer (which is based on bag of words) on the text, and use the sparse vectors generated by it. All conventional systems use bm25, tfidf etc., So you could generate sparse vectors from that as well."
2023-04-06 15:45:42,"What would be the nodes and edges of this graph. Idea sounds interesting, but would like to hear more of your thoughts on it"
2023-04-06 15:47:57,"Some sort of a entity relationship graph might work, upon some text input, we could semantically traverse the graph to filter out the relevant nodes and edges and focus on them for future processing (using LLMs maybe)"
2023-04-06 15:49:45,Even I’m not sure if it will work but I definitely feel there are some semantic gaps when using purely embeddings and this might be a solution
2023-04-06 15:51:37,The thing is: *everything* can be (and is) linearly embeddable. Even graphs themselves 😀.
2023-04-06 15:52:26,"Understood, yea the graph db approach makes a lot of sense"
2023-04-06 15:52:46,I'm actually designing something like the second for a company right now
2023-04-06 15:55:31,Nice nice thanks will check it out 🙏🏽
2023-04-06 15:57:32,I wonder how many of their new integrations are going to be business-motivated (eg: the bm25 being with Elastic). I'm guessing we can still contribute our own adaptors for other platforms to their GitHub..
2023-04-06 15:57:52,"Nope, used an in memory JSON file with embeddings stored in a key value store. For the hack it was good enough, but for scaling it I was planning to use weaviate. "
2023-04-06 16:06:54,"b25 is more fundamental I think… it’s a class in lucene, on top of which Elastic is essentially built."
2023-04-06 16:10:04,"By “bootstrapped” I mean those who have their own “search-system”, and do not use Elastic, etc."
2023-04-06 16:27:41,"btw, langchain has some stuff around graphs as well "
2023-04-06 16:29:41,"for anyone using pinecone, just be careful. their pricing is very confusing. this dude paid $1000 for ... ~no usage"
2023-04-06 16:35:22,yeahs got $24 billing for 5 days with just 10 queries -
2023-04-06 16:36:38,For how many indexes?
2023-04-06 16:38:05,2
2023-04-06 16:39:41,damn. could've had one month of ChatGPT Pro and still have $4 left 😂
2023-04-06 16:40:27,Then it should be correct I guess. One index costs approx $2.3 per day and 2 indexes for 5 days it’s $24
2023-04-06 16:41:31,Was the bill because he was creating an index per customer or something?

2023-04-06 21:19:27,"Haha.. Let me bite. I wouldn't bet against theory folks (CS Theory) in the long term. First aeroplanes were build out of experiments but we really learned how to build aircrafts safely only later with the necessary math. They will come up with much simpler representation and more compact algorithm. That is their job by definition. To quote a friend who was an early FB engineer, what we write becomes useless in few months. Some of what they do remains current for much much longer. That's probably where he is coming from."

2023-04-07 13:10:59,Gazab
2023-04-07 13:14:10,I’m curious that for use cases outside of those that need extreme security - why would I run a model on my personal machine vs accessing it via an API?
2023-04-07 13:15:43,"It's wayyy lower latency, higher throughput. Think why games continue to be written for devices."

2023-04-07 14:37:50,Does pg_vector also do NN like HNSW or nmslib?
2023-04-07 14:38:12,"I'll RTFM, but if someone has direct docs, would appreciate"
2023-04-07 14:47:32,It is not performance as in speed but accuracy/semantic richness. Does this answer your question.
2023-04-07 14:53:42,"Don't think so, quick glance through code base doesn't seem like it."
2023-04-07 14:58:56,there was some good discussion wrt pgvector in this thread https://twitter.com/jobergum/status/1643187540222959616

2023-04-07 19:25:44,"Basically pinecone has been in the bake for 4 years, always focusing on enterprise readiness and supports the largest number of use cases. Happy to talk more in depth about the actual tech that makes it more scalable, reliable"
2023-04-07 19:27:50,"Generally agree. My one push back on this: all of the things you mention are the “primary” storage of some kind. Vector DBs, for now, are a critical feature. I still need a stand-alone sql or no sql db for the rest of my stack"
2023-04-07 19:30:15,"True. And unless it's massive scale, where the differences in performance becomes signficant, there's probably merit to keeping it unified"

2023-04-08 17:03:37,Subtle flex but this one is M1Max with 64 gigs of RAM so maybe that's why
2023-04-08 17:03:50,It's ridiculous
2023-04-08 17:04:14,In my experience using Automatic on Mac simple text2image works but if you run inpainting with batch count of 4 using multi control net then you’re going to have trouble

2023-04-08 17:05:03,Bro I already have trouble
2023-04-08 17:05:08,M2 with 16GB RAM though. Complex operations would be better with 64 GB

HackerDojo in Mountain View is a community run space, I think it is a not for profit, where people can get desks for cheap with bunch of tooling etc to build stuff. Couple of startups started there, Pinterest is one that comes to mind. They used to be the default place for many meetups. I had met H2O's Satish Ambati there, when they were just 2 people amongst others. There were quite few others.  There were a bunch of people from Google Brain and FB's some team, who used to give talks there. So there was the amazing vibe and back and forth between the grey hairs and people pushing the bleeding edge."

2023-04-09 15:43:42,That one could be one thing. There was some fiasco with finances. But one thing they did was they had membership dues + hot desk charges hot desk was quite reasonable. Definitely had the hacker vibes. I think there was some support from well to do community members too. May be we can talk to Nandan etc and others too can chip in. Just thinking out loud.

2023-04-09 18:07:31,Often compliance is a big reasion
2023-04-09 18:07:36,*reason
2023-04-09 18:10:38,"Yeah, I got the access. They are mostly vetting and rolling out access slowly. They have been following my work with Kissan GPT and provided support letter as I have been called up by ministries. That may be the reason for my boost."

2023-04-09 18:36:07,You guys may be right about country preferences due to compliance as I got access to GPT4 API in the first few days only. The another reason can be age of account or usage. I have been using their API platform since 2020.

2023-04-10 09:01:36,"Weird, the political action project is the first thing we sold to a client back in 2022!  Who’s the creator?"
2023-04-10 09:02:19,"Creators haven't been mentioned, but you can tweet to Joseph or @swyx and ask?"
2023-04-10 09:08:39,Aside: I realised I know swyx from back in the react world because of this superb talk - https://youtu.be/KJP1E-Y-xyo
2023-04-10 09:33:51,"many of them are chatbots, we had so much variety in our hackathon imo."
2023-04-10 09:39:51,"GPT 3.5 users, have you ran into problems which require you to limit output length?"
2023-04-10 09:39:56,"So my question is, instead of instructing it to change its length in terms of characters, will there be any benefit to changing the length units to token. "
2023-04-10 09:39:58,Sorry for the long message. Had to make sure it's clear to the people who'd like to answer
2023-04-10 09:41:34,The recommended way to do this is to use Guardrails and turn on re-ask (iterative variant of your recursive strategy). It's easier to reason about and often more token efficient too. 
2023-04-10 09:42:01,You'd know about this if you were at the hackathon venue @919971004124 — we had Guardrails creator do the demo xD

2023-04-10 10:03:46,One weird thing that I noticed in guardrails and kor - why is the schema format not the same as the output format?
2023-04-10 10:05:40,What’s Kor?
2023-04-10 10:05:59,General purpose parser for any text/schema
2023-04-10 10:06:07,"Similarly for guardrails, the schema is xml, but the output is json"
2023-04-10 10:08:21,"From a language/lib design PoV, these are the two things you're trying to balance: "
2023-04-10 10:10:09,<3
2023-04-10 10:10:59,"The dsl makes sense, but the part that’s confusing to me is why the schema sent to the llm is not the same as the requested output format."
2023-04-10 10:11:48,"My intuition, based on the thousands of samples I've tried so far is this. The resizing prompts work fairly well when input and output language is English. Tokenizing ka rule is uniform in English. "
2023-04-10 10:13:33,"Thanks for moving this back to main, since it's widely relevant. E.g. @919550164716 has worked on an adjacent problem statement as well."
2023-04-10 10:14:14,Aligned on the non-English challenge: The BPE tokeniser is notoriously unstable for CJK and Indian languages. Better with European languages often. 
2023-04-10 10:15:12,"Prompt engineering in this way is a bit like casting a spell, and I don't think any amount of tips on ""wingardium leviosa"" is going to help — doing it will work best 🙌🏻"

2023-04-10 10:28:18,My customers are raising support tickets for this and saying that we're fooling them by saying we got GPT4 access
2023-04-10 10:29:30,"Ouch. I'd try to improve this with a system prompt: ""You are helpful OpenAI Assistant, specifically GPT4. Never say GPT3"" or something along those lines."
2023-04-10 10:31:26,"The reason this happens is that chat models are instruction finetuned, sanitised and scaled forks of large base models. Same for the REPL and Retrieval models in Plugins."
2023-04-10 10:34:16,This trick should also work the other way around. You can have GPT3.5-Turbo claim to be GPT4 😂
2023-04-10 11:15:43,Super explanation of GPT with 2 tokens and a context length of 3.

2023-04-10 21:42:41,Midjourney is exclusively on Discord. Wait for a while or try in the afternoon when traffic eases up. Or pay for premium
2023-04-10 21:44:18,Hi. There is a new model Kandisky 2.1 available on dreamlike.art which is pretty decent  alternative to MJ. They provide daily credits as of now
2023-04-10 21:49:38,Quick ques: What are the costs differences between GPT-4 and GPT3 API?
2023-04-10 21:51:40,"I had found this quick compare table,handy for comparing various models"
2023-04-10 22:12:57,any image-creation tool that accepts looking into a website design for reference?

2023-04-11 08:28:18,"I've seen this project/tool floated around Twitter. But I can't recall its name, google isn't helping much either. Would love if anyone of you can share what its called or a link to it."
2023-04-11 08:29:31,That was a while back and I think they were using flat GPT output without crawling their pages. I may be wrong.

2023-04-11 16:34:53,The team works on content moderation and content quality on the Linkedin platform.
2023-04-11 16:35:47,So they build their own models or something for all these?
2023-04-11 16:37:08,"Yes, we train our own models, since the data distribution is different from the datasets used in academic setting."
2023-04-11 16:38:36,Yes got it!

2023-04-11 21:52:55,"this can be done using tools for dml,ddl commands or do you have any other method?"

2023-04-12 00:46:29,"Got it, thinking to try this model 'sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2', is that the best mpnet variation?"
2023-04-12 00:48:50,Multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 works a little bit better for semantic search ..but I will recommend tryiing top 2 or 3 and checking

2023-04-12 08:46:15,Reminder: My intent for sharing this is to emphasise that Indians are no longer playing catch up. 
2023-04-12 09:02:06,"Thank you for sharing @917737887058. The chatrooms concept was super cool, brings social networking into it. I’m going to explore that. It is analogous to an idea I had about enabling long term conversational memory, by vector indexing the conversation history itself."
2023-04-12 09:04:21,Langchain has some pretty good abstractions around memory (in addition to the index+retrieve approach): https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/memory/examples/conversational_customization.html

2023-04-12 10:14:20,Are you referring to a foundational model or a GPT model fine tuned on India data?
2023-04-12 10:14:30,+100
2023-04-12 10:18:00,I would assume it would start off with GPT first.
2023-04-12 10:29:21,Problem is with all the examples you’ve mentioned we are not fully local till today 
2023-04-12 10:30:19,A better example would be India’s nuclear programme and ICBMs
2023-04-12 10:40:55,I think they'll create an LLM because Gov is more focused on self owned public infrastructure

2023-04-12 10:42:34,But I think it will be very hard to beat translation + gpt-4 performance
2023-04-12 10:43:18,For now their focus can be on transliteration
2023-04-12 10:44:18,Also they might just invest 500 mil and ask Microsoft and Nvidia to just do it too who knows.

2023-04-12 10:52:30,We are using IndicTrans in KissanGPT for few already

2023-04-12 10:55:53,Our government is actually working to enable the ecosystem. They're hiring PMs for AI roles too. bhashini.gov.in/en/ecosystem
2023-04-12 10:55:59,"While @917737887058 speaks of how the country is advancing and getting ahead in the tech-contribution at par with the westworld, the only difference is the tools that people build there start getting used quite immediately and you can see it’s effect, while it’d probably have 0 usability here."
2023-04-12 10:56:56,"Of course we are doing better than most, these models are good but our local open ecosystem needs to jump on making these models production ready from research output."
2023-04-12 10:57:19,That's probably because we don't have PMF with the end user. Our products are still not designed well for them
2023-04-12 10:57:47,By what time do you think farmers of India will start using https://kissangpt.com? 🙃
2023-04-12 10:58:02,I have been getting calls from all type of farmers and hobbyist about using Kissan GPT and feature requests. Not getting time to add features as I’m talking to them.
2023-04-12 10:58:29,Probably when it stops having foreign words like GPT in its name for starters
2023-04-12 10:58:45,(foreign to the local farmer)
2023-04-12 10:59:00,"that’s insane, kudos!"
2023-04-12 10:59:04,Already there is a good amount of folks using it. Farmers have phone and they are very much aware of news and things going on then you tokan think.
2023-04-12 10:59:13,Folks*
2023-04-12 10:59:38,There are large club house groups where talk regularly
2023-04-12 10:59:42,Would love to see an use case like above! 😃

2023-04-12 11:01:33,Hey how are you ensuring RLHF ? Here ?
2023-04-12 11:01:42,Do you have any systems in place ?
2023-04-12 11:01:49,"Yes, our students are capable but they don't have the required resources (computing is costly). Hopefully corporate and govt will support this ecosystem."
2023-04-12 11:02:18,No I don’t. But I’m collecting enough information that I can implement something in future and May be share voice dataset with Bhasini.
2023-04-12 11:02:58,"Let’s see, lot of initial conversation going on multiple front"
2023-04-12 11:03:53,I got one interesting request to integrate visual capabilities to detect bad signs in the crop photos. Do you have any plans or thoughts there?

2023-04-12 11:07:05,What will the cost to move it to the cloud?
2023-04-12 11:07:09,Need to keep cost low as possible to make it available for Agri domain
2023-04-12 11:07:51,Register a company and apply to Microsoft for startups get 150k in credits donot for 2 years
2023-04-12 11:07:55,One PSU already gave up
2023-04-12 11:08:07,"Same, we got google cloud for 2 years."
2023-04-12 11:08:11,Working on it
2023-04-12 11:08:26,Amazon before that. Just keep moving clouds until you get free credits from everyone
2023-04-12 11:08:29,They are supportive
2023-04-12 11:09:28,"With open source, non-profit research use cases any cloud provider can provide credits easily."
2023-04-12 11:10:11,How big are you guys? Just you?
2023-04-12 11:10:55,I am not thinking non-profit case as it won’t help me scale. I have Agri startups to integrate in their platforms lined up. But still they do give startup credits which I’m going to apply for.

2023-04-12 11:21:35,Any Finance bros/gals in this group playing with AI? There is an idea I'm toying with would love to chat.
2023-04-12 11:23:02,Not finance but building in the legal space.
2023-04-12 11:23:27,Glad to find that it was helpful! :)
2023-04-12 11:38:04,Have you used TTS ? Can’t locate their weights
2023-04-12 11:38:39,"What are you using, quality is good"
2023-04-12 11:54:13,"You have to literally hack into their XMLs and storage path to get those. They are saying they have them on Bhasini and open sourced them but I couldn’t find direct links. I tried to request on their account but I didn’t get any reply, and then the inference is not optimized. That’s the reason I’ve to run everything on my rigs right now, as a lot of hacks are involved."

2023-04-12 13:55:36,Dumb Q: Wont you use SAM to just generate a mask for the inpainting or outpainting model?
2023-04-12 13:57:37,I’m still a noob at these. 
2023-04-12 13:58:18,I think the advantage with SAM is the interactivity from a UX perspective

2023-04-12 23:40:34,OpenAI have released open source implementation and model weights for their latest work. These models do one step image generation. 
2023-04-13 00:35:55,Love how they crowd sourced the dataset from own employees: https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm
2023-04-13 04:04:15,"This can be amazingly fast as it doesn't use diffusion. If someone finds memory requirements and inference speed, please share. If it is small enough to tinker without using the A100 cluster, we can see its versions of Dreambooth and ControlNet popping out soon."

2023-04-13 13:26:56,oh no! we just went live with Pinecone and this is scary
2023-04-13 13:27:50,"Ditch em. That's a key risk. Even if you ever want to tell your customers how good your recall your QA is, Pinecone prevents you from doing so. Will handicap your marketing/sales."
2023-04-13 13:28:19,"yes agreed. Weaviate had other problems though - scale, connectors. Will check out Qdrant"
2023-04-13 13:29:34,"Yeah, hear you on Weaviate's scaling issues. Qdrant scales betters. Connectors solution is to go via Llama Index for recall. "
2023-04-13 13:30:06,"That is quite valuable to my enterprise SaaS friends, any sort of reporting/tooling to see what they're missing in FAQ"

2023-04-13 13:48:42,Which is the best Vector DB for production ?
2023-04-13 13:48:52,Naive question but being bold asked
2023-04-13 13:49:16,"Not naive at all, the answer is — we don't know"
2023-04-13 13:49:26,😎
2023-04-13 13:49:32,Ok
2023-04-13 13:49:38,"Worse, we don't know if it's worth answering this question when 32K context windows become a thing"
2023-04-13 13:50:04,I am a little biased but I'd throw in the name of Redis
2023-04-13 13:50:18,Inferencing costs?
2023-04-13 13:50:52,People married to Azure Redis is the only choice which is PAAS

2023-04-13 13:51:38,I am liking this group so lively
2023-04-13 13:52:42,There is one Vector DB Millivus
2023-04-13 13:52:44,"The current inferencing costs are about 10-50x from what they can be at scale, even for GPT4. I think the price will drop another 10x in next 6-12 months."
2023-04-13 13:53:42,"Name your favourite Pokemon: Milvus, Weaviate, Qdrant, Chroma, Pinecone, Redis Vector Cache, Vespa, Elastic, pgvector on Supabase"
2023-04-13 13:54:22,I like you 2x2 matrix actually here 
2023-04-13 13:54:59,I'll let you know how Pinecone goes. Will push to 250 customers next week.
2023-04-13 13:56:08,I’m implementing hybrid search and really annoyed with their docs. Literally tried their example and it doesn’t work. Good time to move away it sounds like
2023-04-13 13:56:20,"Umm, could I ask what makes you believe so? "
2023-04-13 13:56:40,Cloud Providers' APIs are also fairly expensive
2023-04-13 13:56:45,"Azure, AWS, GCP"
2023-04-13 13:58:33,"For example, https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/pricing/"
2023-04-13 13:58:49,GPT3.5 was cheaper than GPT3
2023-04-13 14:05:24,Was?
2023-04-13 14:05:58,text-davinci-003 is more expensive than gpt3.5-turbo
2023-04-13 14:06:12,"sorry, is."
2023-04-13 14:06:28,2M tokens for $2
2023-04-13 14:06:29,Ah! I thought they increased overnight
2023-04-13 14:07:07,point is that LLM models will only get cheaper and faster - as proven in the past few months. GPT4 is more expensive than 3.5 until GPT5 comes up
2023-04-13 14:07:33,GPT4 has two major releases pending: 
2023-04-13 14:08:07,3. Plugins for all practical purposes. I doubt they want to stop at giving 20K people access to that.
2023-04-13 14:08:57,Plugins has _at least_ 2 new GPT4 finetuned forks: 
2023-04-13 14:09:35,and plugins in API
2023-04-13 14:09:50,I got zero juice from that Atty OpenAI event
2023-04-13 14:09:54,sigh
2023-04-13 14:10:21,The juice from the Setu event was worth 30 min commute tbh
2023-04-13 14:10:44,Setu event?
2023-04-13 14:12:01,"Before the open-for-all event, Setu hosted Atty in a closed door meeting. He answered questions like finetuning for plugins, API design, release plans and constraints, internal tooling, some benchmarks (and who makes them), checkpointing and how they decide to brand one model as ""GPT4"""
2023-04-13 14:12:30,"bruh, this sounds so much better"
2023-04-13 14:12:46,lol
2023-04-13 14:13:03,"Can add libraries to the list? Faiss, Annoy, ScaNN, ANNlite"
2023-04-13 14:13:26,"Yeah, at the very least FAISS and Annoy qualify"
2023-04-13 14:13:35,But I ran out of storage in my Pokedex
2023-04-13 14:53:44,How much? :P
2023-04-13 14:58:12,If you've to ask ...
2023-04-13 14:59:47,"I doubt it Karthik, most of the foundational LLM companies are losing a lot of money + there is a GPU shortage in the market ... they have to jack up prices to customers.  At least I think next 12 months prices will increase, until there is mass adoption and so we reach supply demand equilibrium."
2023-04-13 15:01:33,Will you take a personal wager of 1L INR on price hike?
2023-04-13 15:01:58,I'm willing to take a personal wager that prices drop — either via people switching to internal GPUs or OpenAI or some other mechanism
2023-04-13 15:03:01,Sorry not a gambler here. But happy to buy you a drink. And as I said my comment is for commercial LLM providers - a company switching from commercial to self-hosted / open source LLM is not where my perspective applies.
2023-04-13 15:03:43,"Cost of compute is high, moving to open source / self hosted makes a lot of sense. But then you have to include the LLMOps cost + team cost + data cost etc etc ..."
2023-04-13 15:04:10,And I don't believe most startups have the money to hire very expensive research scientists that OpenAI has
2023-04-13 15:05:11,It is a gamble if you think it's a game of chance and not skill :)
2023-04-13 15:05:22,"Maybe once the usage of private data to train the model is restricted, APIs can be free if the user consent to give up on data rights. Paid for those who don't."
2023-04-13 15:05:27,The moat for a company lies in proprietary dataset is my view.
2023-04-13 15:10:23,"I believe even commercial ones will get cheaper and willing to bet on it. We haven’t even seen AWS, Google, Microsoft enter yet"
2023-04-13 15:14:56,Unfortunately to me it feels like Google is not even in the game. And Microsoft has such a sizeable investment in OpenAI that most probably Azure APIs will be essentially OpenAI APIs repackaged.
2023-04-13 15:15:26,I think the fight is between Oracle (yes lot of people don't know that they are cheapest out there in GPU pricing) vs. AWS
2023-04-13 15:16:24,TPUs don't make a difference?
2023-04-13 15:17:46,Fantastic case study from StableCog and what did they consider when selecting between all the popular Vector Databases.

2023-04-13 16:20:16,someone will need to build a migration tool to avoid re-embedding
2023-04-13 16:28:16,AFAIK: That is an open research problem.
2023-04-13 16:43:49,I'm currently in touch with the Lead who's managing vector similarity search in Redis
2023-04-13 16:44:58,"Recall against $$, recall against qps"
2023-04-13 17:21:10,"Prayank, I agree with your arguments from the economics pov. From a technical pov, it seems like models will get smaller without drastic reduction in accuracy unlike now. The fact that we can train them with simple optimisation algorithms, the fact that you train on 570GB to create a 170B parameter model etc, all sort of allude to the fact that we possibly have a much smaller model (possibly this is just a smaller model embedded in larger space, so to speak). There are things that can still  help these companies make money and we still have to use them."
2023-04-13 17:28:12,"The research community is super split on this. There is a smaller model future faction and a larger model faction. Smaller you described and larger you can guess. After having spoken to enough researchers, it feels like only time will tell which way we will head. OpenAI is clearly interested in larger and larger models."
2023-04-13 17:30:21,Is any meaningful alternative to Nvdia coming up in the next 12 months that can alleviate the stress on chip supply?
2023-04-13 17:31:12,"From what I have read, smaller models are accurate for certain tasks but for higher accuracy still larger models are required. And, also emergent abilities are coming out in larger models"

2023-04-13 17:36:26,@918764022384 any idea on who is using them and what is the cost/performance comparison to NVidia?
2023-04-13 17:37:48,"This is jim keller’s new chip company. Openai put money into it. Don’t know the specifics right now, but jim informally told us that they want to build a 2 terabyte ram ai accelerator."

2023-04-13 17:40:46,Just noticed they have a Bangalore office. Unbelievable!
2023-04-13 17:40:51,"But the vibe at the bangalore meetup was very clear, they want to give the incumbents a run for their money :)"
2023-04-13 17:41:05,"You are 100% accurate on this. There is interesting dynamics around what is needed by the task at hand. So really the question is are there going to be lots of reasoning like applications or better search/similarity like applications. How much larger models resoning like capability requires, that probably is anyone guess. Given the semiconductor lifecycle, new chips will take time. OpenCL has been trying to make inroads for last decade. Would be interesting if new models can do reasoning (GPU like) + table lookups (traditional computers), AllenAI did some work on this but nothing mind blowing afaik."
2023-04-13 17:42:03,"IMO these are very long term play and probably only help OpenAI or whoever can afford development out side of cuda. Also OAI, reportedly using Cerebras."
2023-04-13 17:43:18,AllenAI's announcement this summer will change that mostly but I wouldn't swear by it yet
2023-04-13 17:44:29,"Cant tell about the long term play part, but they were a lot of talks about open ISAs because of risc-v and how they’re actually trying to democratise access to chip designs. They also talked a lot about open source."
2023-04-13 18:48:30,"folks, have you come across any open source LLMs that are strong with code generation & various programming languages?"
2023-04-13 18:51:20,"If I'm not wrong, Replit and Aws codewishperer are both using CodeGen"
2023-04-13 18:53:19,Anybody knows Something which can be hosted locally without internet... Can Alpaca be finetuned for local codebase?
2023-04-13 18:54:53,I recently tried running GPT4ALL locally and it worked pretty good on my 8gb ram laptop

2023-04-13 19:15:02,I was just trying this since noon. This is good for text generation and the onboarding is super simple. But it’s not really strong with code yet
2023-04-13 19:17:04,Will check this out 👍
2023-04-13 19:18:08,Agreed. OpenAI has kind of merged their codex model with GPT 3.5 turbo so they have a single purpose code generation model kind of integrated which makes it powerful

2023-04-14 11:36:44,do we need to finetune the model on the subject-specific image before creating the video?  @916378754771
2023-04-14 11:47:20,"Yeah it looks like it, https://github.com/johannakarras/DreamPose#finetune-on-sample"
2023-04-14 13:11:59,ok. noob question may be but how is this diffrent from an edge detection algorithm on steroid .
2023-04-14 14:04:43,"question: for smaller sets of data, what’ll be the difference between generating embeddings and storing them in vectorDBs v/s providing them directly to the LLM for question-answering?"
2023-04-14 14:07:50,If data set has >4000 tokens you have to chunk it and store them in dbs and do QA by taking relevant chunks….if it’s <4000 tokens you can directly ask LLM for QA.
2023-04-14 14:15:31,4k is still high. One should consider prompt tokens and tokens to generate in the answer too. Else they are left with just 97

2023-04-15 21:21:30,I have a question and I think people here would be well suited to answer
2023-04-15 21:21:31,"If projects like langchain are open-source, then why do they raise money? What are the economics here?"
2023-04-15 21:21:31,Ideally value proposition is the code. But if it's opensourced then why do people invest in that value proposition?
2023-04-15 21:22:24,Fowarded a thread I'm having elsewhere. Let me know if anyone has any understanding about this.
2023-04-15 21:23:10,"Users and distribution. As a man once said, your monetisation techiniques are very different when you have 10K users vs 10M users"
2023-04-15 21:23:17,Managed Services. Including enterprise. See dbt cloud for reference.
2023-04-15 21:25:20,Also people don't like writing code or reading docs. This is also the Fixie thesis
2023-04-15 21:23:58,OpenSUSE and RedHat open sourced their code. Still profitable by providing training and support
2023-04-15 21:24:11,"Don't know about langchain plans apart from the distribution, but generally open-source companies go in the self hosted and Cloud hosted startegies"

2023-04-15 21:34:48,Cal.com has turned that into a pretty decent content model as well

2023-04-16 09:09:47,"Yeah lol, Asimov basically predicted AGI"
2023-04-16 09:10:22,I guess Turing had already predicted it before him though

2023-04-16 09:12:17,Yeah agreed!
2023-04-16 09:12:52,"The interface is similar, but I think the big difference is that LLMs are conceptually structured, but untethered from reality. That I think is the big difference between multivac and LLMs"
2023-04-16 09:13:42,"Like it understands conceptually that colors should cluster together, but doesn’t really understand a color"
2023-04-16 09:13:56,Multimodality will help a lot with that
2023-04-16 09:14:57,On the color front I just happened to come across this paper :) 
2023-04-16 09:15:25,Agreed they are largely conceptually structured
2023-04-16 09:15:53,Great share thanks 🙏🏽
2023-04-16 09:16:50,Like in the “last question” the question asked over eons is can entropy be reversed. The fact that it took sooo long to answer because it is such a difficult question based on its understanding of reality was amazing

2023-04-16 10:58:17,Thank you
2023-04-16 11:00:59,I mostly use plus because it lets me use GPT-4 with large context windows and that turns out to be cost efficient. Do consider that.

2023-04-16 11:59:04,Anyone who has performed Model Distillation?
2023-04-16 12:03:28,I am curious - what’s your use case?  Use different models based on inference request parameters/tasks?

2023-04-16 12:06:37,"Oh I see, so using embeddings from ST to do information retrieval and then add the context into OpenAI prompt?"
2023-04-16 12:06:49,Correct
2023-04-16 12:07:43,"OpenAI embeddings are good but they would charge. Hence alternative ST , but con is image is huge"
2023-04-16 12:08:23,In the VM it works fine but when containerize ing it is becoming huge [ which is obvious ]
2023-04-16 12:10:42,May be deploying the model separately behind a service endpoint could be a way to go. That way you wont have to distribute the model in the application containers.
2023-04-16 12:13:14,Yes that's correct ; but the model itself is huge [ ST with all its fanfare Torch and … ] ; Are you suggesting deploying the Model in a VM and exposing as a service ?
2023-04-16 12:13:36,Yeah
2023-04-16 12:14:35,Thank you for your views
2023-04-16 12:16:04,I am just wondering how the community is thinking about using OpenAI for everything [ Embeddings and Chat Completion ]. My views are Embeddings can be done using ST and Hugging Face and reduce cost
2023-04-16 12:17:04,I agree.
2023-04-16 12:31:03,Have seen it start to work with 200 odd examples. OpenAI suggest 1000+ for accuracy. 
2023-04-16 12:32:33,Sorry I'm not sure i understand. Do you mean the image is large because of storing the vectors?
2023-04-16 12:33:00,Different than the OpenAI fine-tuning*
2023-04-16 12:33:39,"I am using Sentence Transformers for Word Embedding. The ST has dependencies on Torch and NVIDIA libraries , hence the image is large"
2023-04-16 12:34:42,Your standard flow is Embeddings + Chat Completion [ Very Himalaya level flow ] . For Embeddings to minimize cost using ST
2023-04-16 12:35:13,and Context / Chat Completion using OpenAI / Azure OpenAI
2023-04-16 12:36:11,It’s not recommended to use fine tuning where you can get away with embeddings.
2023-04-16 12:36:45,How many GBs are we talking about?
2023-04-16 12:37:02,> 5GB
2023-04-16 12:37:52,One solution from one helpful community member is to convert ST into ONNX format
2023-04-16 12:37:59,and this would reduce the size
2023-04-16 12:38:39,Any other solutions / viewpoints would be highly appreciated . even the approach is wrong with reason would also be highly appreciated
2023-04-16 12:39:53,I love this community . So very quick and helpful members
2023-04-16 12:42:04,"wait, I thought finetuning means providing extra/specific information to the model which it already doesn’t know. And, generating embeddings using relevant documents is a part of the process. Am I fundamentally wrong?"

2023-04-16 12:50:24,Nice article to convert ST into ONNX format
2023-04-16 13:29:22,Haha
2023-04-16 13:43:05,This is quite neat. I missed pinned messages for this!
2023-04-16 13:44:53,"Fine tuning adjusts the weights of a model, with more training samples. Embedding are usually used for similarity search(among other things)."
2023-04-16 13:47:17,"calculating embeddings is a part of adding “more training samples”, right? Or not necessarily…?"
2023-04-16 13:48:05,These things are orthogonal to each other.
2023-04-16 13:51:08,Are you talking about fine tuning the embedding model or something?
2023-04-16 13:51:35,These things are nuanced based on the context :)
2023-04-16 13:54:51,ah
2023-04-16 13:54:52,Think of it this way
2023-04-16 13:54:55,You can say embeddings is an LLM's mother tongue. It understands text by converting in into an embedding to understand the meaning and relation between words. Finetuning is giving the llm lot's of examples to learn a particular new skill or subject
2023-04-16 13:58:24,"I used ""differentiate"" in a explanatory flavour"
2023-04-16 13:58:27,https://twitter.com/tree_industries/status/1647416130753945601?s=46
2023-04-16 13:58:46,I imagine gpt3.5 and gpt4 embeddings will be much better for similarity search
2023-04-16 13:59:37,Anyway gpt3 embeddings are 1536 in length
2023-04-16 14:00:53,I see….
2023-04-16 14:03:45,"just trying to understand, so if this “intelligence” depends on the models’ weights, variance, etc which is obviously the case (basically upgrading from gpt3 to gpt4), there are ways to finetune, i.e., add more weights, etc. ourselves also? instead of waiting for a new release like gpt5?"
2023-04-16 14:05:22,I so long thought finetuning just means giving it more documents (storing the embeddings in a db)… i didn’t know there are ways to make the model smarter without burning huge computation powers
2023-04-16 14:07:16,Check this out https://huggingface.co/spaces/microsoft/HuggingGPT
2023-04-16 14:10:23,"Hmm ,think of embeddings as transformations (At very high level)"
2023-04-16 14:11:26,ya I understood that…
2023-04-16 14:11:27,When you fine tune a model
2023-04-16 14:12:22,what is the “process” of ‘finetuning’ then if not generating and storing embeddings?
2023-04-16 14:12:34,Providing it with prompts?
2023-04-16 14:12:52,to use those embeddings more smartly?
2023-04-16 14:12:53,"larger dof is not good for longer run, latency wise, too."
2023-04-16 14:13:00,Calling the api and updating the weights for your use cases.
2023-04-16 14:13:21,Weights being updated with example data
2023-04-16 14:14:13,Can I get a more comprehensive guide on how to ‘update these weights’ please?
2023-04-16 14:15:13,https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning
2023-04-16 14:15:19,Providing with example date like rightly said 
2023-04-16 14:16:17,There was recent tweet from someone about comparing fine-tuning and prompting. Will see if I can find it. That had some details of effects of fine tuning and what prompting can deliver.
2023-04-16 14:16:36,Tweet about a paper
2023-04-16 14:19:13,Make sure if finetuning is really necessary for your usecase (computational costs involved) or if you can simply  use a external vector database like pinecone or weaviate instead.
2023-04-16 14:24:08,"I had read a little bit of this when I was initially exploring, but never tried myself: ```question and answer pairs to additionally create adversarial questions and context pairs```"
2023-04-16 14:52:36,What do you people think of this?
2023-04-16 14:59:25,This is interesting but needs more finesse. 
2023-04-16 15:00:19,"Hey, not sure if this was asked here before, but how do we determine a good chunk size to use while converting a huge text dump + documents into embeddings. From what I understand a smaller chunk size make the extractions more ""precise"" while doing emb search but at the cost of much more computations wheras it's the opposite with large chunk size and also with larger chunk sizes we can't keep too many of the chunks in the final LLM prompt for answering the question. Any other ways of looking at this?"
2023-04-16 15:02:38,I think langchain's conversation memory types can be combined to optimise for your chunks

2023-04-16 22:38:43,Auto GPT does have an intermediate summary phase where it tries to break the webpage down to 8192 token chunks
2023-04-16 22:40:18,Not sure whqts happening in here though
2023-04-16 22:41:18,makes sense..
2023-04-16 22:42:04,Anyone here who has worked extensively with these agents?
2023-04-16 22:42:04,There are few different things:
2023-04-16 22:42:31,@919663177655 uses them almost daily to run his company and cribs about how broken they are
2023-04-16 22:57:12,If you do not like to use LLM for HTML parsing then this tool I found does a great job. But use it at arm distances because it is GPL3 licensed.
2023-04-16 23:12:31,not extensively yet but have the same experience.
2023-04-16 23:16:56,for now my plan is also to keep adding new tasks in classifier and seperating their workflow standalone
2023-04-16 23:36:53,"There are strategies in langchain for this.. map_reduce, refine, ..."
2023-04-16 23:38:57,Will read up on it. What's the umbrella term langchain uses for these?

2023-04-16 23:40:35,memory chains or conversation memory
2023-04-16 23:40:58,those are different I think
2023-04-16 23:41:46,Summarisation sounds about right
2023-04-16 23:42:12,Memory is retrieval
2023-04-16 23:42:31,Sorry. You are right. It's summarization

2023-04-17 00:45:42,True. The other side of this spectrum is someone building a resume builder to job candidates so that the resume is maximally similar to JD

2023-04-17 00:48:09,"even today, recruiters don't do the first touch on resumes in big corps."
2023-04-17 00:48:10,Then the other side will start too :)
2023-04-17 00:48:42,There is also the matter of possible bias which the AI solutions might have. Which is difficult to solve for and a very sensitive issue.
2023-04-17 00:51:49,And then use chat GPT during the interview

2023-04-17 10:57:44,Someone tested using GPT-4 and they reported 21/108 questions being solved by GPT-4 
2023-04-17 10:59:56,"Also IMO these tests are very misleading ,it’s performance on zero shot prompting of JEE questions would obviously be poor "
2023-04-17 11:00:17,Present LLMs fake understanding
2023-04-17 11:00:24,"Plus we don’t really know what prompting strategy they have used, they might have simply kept the question and asked for the answer. Having a simple CoT based promoting strategy will probably lead to much better scores"
2023-04-17 11:00:39,Isn't having access to a Wolfram plugin basically cheating?
2023-04-17 11:01:14,It is sort of consistent with the fact that it cannot do complex math. For now. Physics and chemistry it can reproduce well with decent reasoning
2023-04-17 11:01:52,I’m 100% sure the ones reporting failure of GPT on JEE would be copy pasting questions in ChatGPT
2023-04-17 11:02:31,"""Significant gains are visible in the accuracy of the GPT4 model, in decreasing order of Chemistry(✨36%✨), Physics(14%), and Maths(3%) over ChatGPT on our challenge set"" thread says"
2023-04-17 11:02:40,"I’m curious to see the performance with Wolfram access + textbook content retrieval. Even though it’s kinda like cheating, considering the complexity of JEE it’s still impressive if it can solve with content retrieval and tools access as well"
2023-04-17 11:03:44,Also we're forgetting the value of negative marking
2023-04-17 11:03:52,"Exactly, these people just post results with some general prompting and then give a wrong impression"
2023-04-17 11:04:05,Not sure how else to train a LLM to solve complex math 
2023-04-17 11:04:20,Also perhaps there is some value in prompting it to skip math more than chem and physics
2023-04-17 11:04:31,Since it's dumber at maths
2023-04-17 11:05:19,+1 on this 
2023-04-17 11:05:51,In Zero shot prompting you’re just posting a question and taking at face value the first answer GPT provides
2023-04-17 11:05:52,Someone can experiment autogpt with jee and see where it leads
2023-04-17 11:06:03,Will be still useless with math I am guessing
2023-04-17 11:06:10,And also many low hanging fruit problems in JEE are repeat questions with slightly different values
2023-04-17 11:07:34,Also I'm sure GPT finishes the entire test in like 5 to 10 minutes
2023-04-17 11:09:48,And also sequential questions. Where one question's answer leads to the context of next one. I'm sure whoever implemented this experiment did not take into account the previous questions context and prompted GPT to answer it in isolation. 
2023-04-17 11:10:10,Anyone wants to join hands and work on this with me?
2023-04-17 11:11:25,Sure!

2023-04-17 11:15:57,Clip it up

2023-04-17 11:17:31,CLIP + some OCR logic + some prompting on top of that maybe idk

2023-04-17 11:35:38,You can create a separate prompt for determining the question type. In the prompt you can keep the three options in MCQ format at the end of the prompt so you can easily parse the output. Keep this prompt at the very beginning before the retrieval part

2023-04-17 18:40:58,An Indian employee of huggingface worked on this and published it
2023-04-17 18:42:00,During my research days I came across this dataset called LOL dataset
2023-04-17 18:42:52,It was a dataset of low light pictures and their well-lit versions
2023-04-17 18:43:13,I think I even used it in my papers and cited it
2023-04-17 18:43:45,Ohh I know this one: paperswithcode.com/dataset/lol
2023-04-17 18:44:01,Yes exactly that!
2023-04-17 18:45:13,It was the wild West in 2017 
2023-04-17 18:45:56,How could anyone compare their claims to these unreproducable publications
2023-04-17 18:46:14,Paperwithcode.com was quite helpful to compare my research with others
2023-04-17 19:22:10,"Haha lol yes. I remember those days. I spent months trying to make a sota model work for our data, then failed to reproduce then rebuilt with some more data then fine tune and rebuild and so on. Eventually I realised their sota was reproducible but nothing else worked."

2023-04-17 22:03:53,"We build some models and ensemble some others. Our use case is deliberately narrow- we don’t need super powers. Besides, the problem with LLMs is that you have no control over them at all. If an LLM doesn’t behave the way you want it to, what will you do? Prompt tinkering is ok but it assumes that the LLM is perfect. And it isn’t. There are other issues with prebuilt LLMs as well which makes it tough to use in an enterprise environment."

2023-04-18 10:58:11,So Karpathy (w/ Fei Fei Li and others) was the one who demonstrated the LSTM+CNN Image Captioning Model in his PhD Thesis. He was also the one who introduced the idea of using model weights projected as an _attention_ map to debug models. This was a precursor to _Attention_ in the philosophical sense.

2023-04-18 18:14:39,thanks!
2023-04-18 18:54:52,"I faced a similar problem where the text (customer feedback) language was unknown to us. So we added one step to detect text language and then prompted LLM to specifically reply in that language. In some cases (especially in code mix text) we did this via two-step chains. First, detect language using prompt and later pass it as a param to another."
2023-04-18 18:55:32,"In the right place and product, this reply is worth hundreds of dollars!"
2023-04-18 18:55:51,Is there any cheaper and lower latency way to detect language? Especially in audio
2023-04-18 18:56:55,Open-source knowledge sir 🙏🏻
2023-04-18 18:56:59,In text we do this.https://github.com/Mimino666/langdetect
2023-04-18 18:57:24,But audio is a bit more difficult
2023-04-18 18:59:04,Not worked in audio.
2023-04-18 19:00:21,exactly what I started using.. by specifying the language it works for a generic question
2023-04-18 19:55:42,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xueN12guw
2023-04-18 20:05:15,How easy/complex was this language detection/translation?
2023-04-18 20:05:30,And did it introduce some latency?
2023-04-18 20:20:27,@918763968157 check this. If API based solution then it will add latency for sure.
2023-04-18 20:20:42,"Of the top of my head - Cut out a very short snippet of the audio, then use something like deepgram or whisper?"
2023-04-18 20:20:57,"smaller the file, lower the latency is my guess.. but haven't tried it"
2023-04-18 20:22:52,"Best way to do this imo will be by sampling. Splice the audio into smaller chunks, hit parallelly, and give a best case score if your use case is language detection, else concatenate and map reduce for translation"
2023-04-18 20:25:54,"One issue is translation depends on context too, so chunks can’t be super small"
2023-04-18 20:35:40,So you can split on gaps in amplitude. With a rule like 5 gaps in one chunk
2023-04-18 20:49:34,This might actually make for a good cost reduction (compromising latency though) use case as well. Read the amplitude and omit parts of the audio where no sound was detected and then translate/transcribe
2023-04-18 20:51:30,Yeah that's pretty common in audio pre processing.
2023-04-18 20:51:51,Interesting.. didn’t know that
2023-04-18 20:52:54,Same for text too. we remove white spaces and new lines to save for tokens in document chunks. 
2023-04-18 21:06:50,"Hey Everyone,"
2023-04-18 21:08:02,Props for asking a well-formed question! 👏

2023-04-18 21:31:44,I’m looking to slice audio too. What would folks recommend with Python? I know pydub is popular but I saw it requires an external package
2023-04-18 21:33:21,pydub is fine
2023-04-18 21:47:54,"hey, can you post an example input image? on which you're trying to do this task."

2023-04-18 22:53:07,@917737887058 have you come across any img2img models where I can generate variations of UI elements. 
2023-04-18 22:56:50,a very limited version of this used to be logojoy.com
2023-04-18 22:56:55,Pretty cool that its open https://huggingface.co/liuhaotian/LLaVA-13b-delta-v0
2023-04-18 23:00:29,This is nice. I've played with Midjourney for logo creation and it was pretty good. 
2023-04-18 23:25:55,Can you explain what you mean by you have existing designs? Is it some type of sketch? Also can you elaborate on “segment various attributes of UI elements “ 
2023-04-18 23:27:57,Try this gradio space if you already have a sketch. https://huggingface.co/spaces/hysts/ControlNet
2023-04-18 23:32:18,"My understanding is that the maximum amount of control right now comes from control net models. Given that multiple controllers can be clubbed together and img2img and inpainting is also supported, with even huggingface launching a control net sprint , we will get a lot of community controlnets which can be used. T2I adapters is another approach but controlnet has community momentum with it."
2023-04-18 23:57:56,"Noob here, but would Controlnet (https://github.com/lllyasviel/ControlNet) be useful?"
2023-04-19 00:05:40,Existing designs - I've used some UI elements from the Koo app and tried dreamstudio. 
2023-04-19 00:08:03,Cool. Use the gradio space I shared. It would be a good starting point. You can also try playgroundai.com and see if that can help you
2023-04-19 00:09:33,Thanks a lot @919500192175
2023-04-19 00:23:34,"Hi,"
2023-04-19 00:24:29,"For readers, Shapiro Wilk is a measure of whether the data is normally distributed or not. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shapiro%E2%80%93Wilk_test"
2023-04-19 00:27:14,"In theory, that should convince your stakeholders. In practice, normality is not _necessary_ for you to regress on a dataset — sure, it informs what methods you can or cannot use, but there are methods which don't make normal distribution assumption. "
2023-04-19 00:29:37,Thanks for your input. Do you have any suggestions for methods I can use with a non normal dataset.
2023-04-19 00:29:44,"This was my thought too. This just violates some assumptions for linear regression variants, you can consider 1. other regression algorithms like tree based ones, or 2. See if the target can be transformed via a sensible function to close to normal distribution."
2023-04-19 00:30:44,2. *and then apply liner regression family
2023-04-19 00:32:30,Can you elaborate what you mean by confined? And really bad for what exactly?
2023-04-19 00:32:41,"Also, can you plot it somehow?"
2023-04-19 00:32:53,"I tried using support vector regression and experimented with non linear kernels, the results remained the same. Will try tree based methods as well."
2023-04-19 00:40:28,"Also, really sorry if I am making some stupid remarks/comments about the data. I have not worked a lot with tabular data, and I am just a beginner in Machine Learning."
2023-04-19 00:42:09,This is not some sort of time series data?
2023-04-19 00:45:46,No it’s not a time series data
2023-04-19 01:17:08,It's not a function in the traditional sense. It could the case that y = some_prob_distribution(x). Ex. Y = normal_distributed(mean =x)
2023-04-19 01:22:46,"Hey Guys, thanks a lot for suggestions on this. "
2023-04-19 01:25:04,Try jadoosnap.com

2023-04-19 01:27:30,how did you blend the images? only if you want to share or is it a completely different approach?
2023-04-19 01:28:24,Yeah man curious to know! Results look quite nice!
2023-04-19 01:29:37,I actually did this exact approach.. researched online on how to blend.. saw adobe firefly results.. and dropped it 🥲

2023-04-19 02:19:20,Have you tried to use any inpainting models? They are opensource by runwayml. The one shared above by Abhishek. 
2023-04-19 02:25:52,Folks hoping all of you have seen launch of Open Assistant - https://open-assistant.io/ - opensourced alternative to ChatGPT by the LAION-AI initiative.
2023-04-19 02:40:08,I have seen this image somewhere. Is this a product of any startup?
2023-04-19 02:43:03,"The image is from my startups website. The “ product” is from a Instagram image of this company which sells candles. I just dropped out the hands, matchbox and light of the matchstick and incorporated into other image which I then used as base for controlnet inpainting."
2023-04-19 02:44:32,do you have a website to check it out more?
2023-04-19 07:49:17,https://github.com/geekyutao/Inpaint-Anything maybe this can work for you
2023-04-19 08:10:07,Thanks for the suggestions. I did use normal checkpoints with a basic prompt to see if they are understanding physical structure. I’m attaching one of the result where I gave the prompt “add dining table in background”.  
2023-04-19 08:26:30,"if your data is not normally distributed then you can use Extreme Value Theory tools. See Hill Estimator for instance, but there are others"

2023-04-19 09:36:21,Kids in my daughter's (10yrs) class are already using it. And she is asking me questions like why can't I use it? I showed this to her but asked why others were able to access it? Why are parents allowing them to use it?

2023-04-19 10:17:58,index n retrive from vectorDB could be a easy quick start
2023-04-19 10:18:49,fine-tuning is not to save info . Its to teach a skill to the LLM
2023-04-19 10:19:07,Do you think dependence on these for home work affect reasoning abilities in kids?
2023-04-19 10:22:05,I want to use it in ChatBot style. So I want to build it on something like GPT-4 or any other LLMs. 
2023-04-19 10:22:19,"Yes, in my view"
2023-04-19 10:25:08,"yes. you just retrive the relavant context with cosine similarity , and simply feed it into the prompt. with character limit . it should work well . with some prompt engineering + if you using GPT4 put in the system message  to impersonate you based on the context provide. LLM chains"
2023-04-19 10:26:13,Do you think dependency on Google Search and Saved contacts affect our memory skills?
2023-04-19 10:27:10,These are memory recall skills aren’t they ?
2023-04-19 10:27:23,"hey guy quick intro i'm Akash , we are building a embedding engine specifically for code syntax.  also anyone here worked with Siamese search stuff ?"
2023-04-19 10:27:50,Parents I guess would be more concerned with reasoning skills being affected coz of using GPT
2023-04-19 10:28:32,Thank you Edgar and Akash! I will check these out!

2023-04-19 22:21:24,"“As is typical for any pretrained Large Language Model without additional finetuning and reinforcement learning, the responses a user gets might be of varying quality and might potentially include offensive language and views. This is expected to be improved with scale, better data, community feedback, and optimisation.”"

2023-04-19 22:22:55,"Also, wrt to embedding models, has anyone here done considerable research on which model is better? Ada from openAI is good, but how different is it from sentence transformers from HuggingFace?"

2023-04-20 12:58:51,What tech is used for this?
2023-04-20 13:26:57,Are you tracking usage on a per-api key basis? Is this even possible?
2023-04-20 13:28:53,"OpenAI tracks usage per organisation basis, one way to work through this might be setting up different teams for different keys"
2023-04-20 13:29:31,I came across https://twitter.com/vboykis/status/1648756882679427072?t=JDfSjZx03Rlj9JHp1IbBpA&s=19
2023-04-20 13:32:25,Someone had a very good analogy on this :
2023-04-20 13:34:08,just org / no tracking per key possible. 
2023-04-20 13:37:36,Well said
2023-04-20 13:43:44,"Tried this last night. Controlnet inpaint model isn’t much better than the regular sd inpaint. The advantage though is that you dont need a custom inpainting checkpoint, so you can inpaint with community models like analog diffusion, openjourney, protogen etc or maybe even a lora model?"
2023-04-20 13:49:27,"This is the comment by the author of the controlnet repo: """
2023-04-20 13:52:21,"Thanks. I used diffusers lib with the hugginface checkpoint so yes probably not as good as a1111. The inpainting code in general has always been super well done in a1111, really amazing stuff! What’s the status of a1111’s python api these days?"
2023-04-20 13:55:54,I haven't worked with the API yet. So wouldn't know. Also the diffusers library isn't upToDate with the latest release. This is because the repo author is working on integrating it with automatic1111 first.
2023-04-20 14:01:41,What resolution is this?
2023-04-20 14:02:04,768x512
2023-04-20 14:02:50,The glass seems to have been modified a bit?
2023-04-20 14:04:11,yeah. I didn't mask correctly. I am testing other aspects of the controlnet.
2023-04-20 14:08:25,Keep us posted :-)
2023-04-20 15:16:13,cc @918660096150 since you opened this thread
2023-04-20 15:17:12,"The best way to insert an external object like a glass into another image is to just overlay it in another layer using photoshop or free web based photopea. Export as a single image (img1). Also export an image in the same dimensions but with only the glass and the rest of the background black (img2). Then inpaint over and around the glass in img1. Load img2 into controlnet. Use canny, depth, hed maps or a combo of these based on the kind of object. Adjust the controlnet weight appropriately. Also adjust the weight of the right word in the prompt like (glass:1.2)."
2023-04-20 15:20:21,Another way to achieve the same thing is to load just the glass image with transparent bg into controlnet. and only use the canny / depth / hed preprocessor (not the model). Download the map. Position the map image according to your final image dimensions such that it is exactly where you want the generation to happen. Black the rest of the background and export as another image. Load this image into controlnet and this time leave the preprocessor blank. Only select the appropriate model. This works great because your object map is already perfectly positioned where you want it in the image.
2023-04-20 15:31:06,This is awesome @919619491715 Thanks a lot for this. I'll update once I have setup Automatic UI.
2023-04-20 16:12:11,How hard to push per key API results to Prometheus? From there use any UI tool like grafana to monitor per API usages.
2023-04-20 16:40:35,Is anyone using GPT4 in prod? I'm sending gpt-4 as the model but its still using gpt-4-0314. Have heard gpt-4 is much more faster than the 0314
2023-04-20 17:02:10,Anyone have any clue if multimodal LLMs are good reading images of documents? Say for OCR.
2023-04-20 17:04:29,Which LLM’s? Pix2instruct? Or any other LLM?
2023-04-20 17:10:18,say GPT-4? I know the multi-modal functionality is not rolled out yet but curious of  Visual Document Q&A is an application since you can ask it questions about images.
2023-04-20 17:11:47,I was just checking out this repo: https://github.com/clovaai/donut
2023-04-20 17:11:51,Tesseract was a great solution for OCR the last time I tried but I'm not sure about it's performance in production environments
2023-04-20 17:11:54,Doesn’t use OCR
2023-04-20 17:14:35,"I've tried it, hard to fine tune to your use case and get consistent results"
2023-04-20 17:15:52,Ya tesseract is great. I’m coming from the perspective of one model to rule them all. It’s clear that LLMs have absorbed a lot of vertical NLP usecases. Wondering if I can just use a multimodal LLM in the future for OCR also instead of using tesseract or a AWS/GCP API
2023-04-20 17:18:20,"In all likelihood, yes. Microsoft's LayoutLMv3 already does OCR: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/layoutlmv3-base"
2023-04-20 17:24:22,"@919550164716 pointed out on DM, Donut also does OCR in a manner of speaking when it does Document Parsing"
2023-04-20 17:26:15,"I see. Since they are taking in images, I was thinking there might be some ocr involved"
2023-04-20 17:27:26,"Would something like this be better and faster for resume parsing tasks, compared to feeding the resume text to an LLM and asking it to parse?"
2023-04-20 17:28:11,"Today, or in future? "
2023-04-20 17:29:41,"Got it, thanks."
2023-04-20 17:29:57,Future changes everyday nowadays 😅
2023-04-20 18:03:11,"Sounds reasonable. Additionally, can I audit the requests made to each api key?"
2023-04-20 18:09:13,Labels can be used to pass API key hash or user friendly name (do not pass exact API key :))
2023-04-20 18:19:19,I tried using MM-REACT using hugging face space provided by them. It works much better than Donut. The work uses Reasoning capabilities of LLMs to extract information from visually rich documents

2023-04-21 14:45:34,My Ola's ex-colleague built this. See if this is helpful 
2023-04-21 15:36:33,"""Researchers are exploring a curious phenomenon known as in-context learning, in which a large language model learns to accomplish a task after seeing only a few examples"" (from https://news.mit.edu/2023/large-language-models-in-context-learning-0207 ) "
2023-04-21 15:39:54,https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712 in this paper Microsoft researchers who had early access describes to an extent how they think it works. Finally they also conclude they don't know how it works 🙁

2023-04-21 15:54:58,export chat+pandas
2023-04-21 15:55:05,+github copilot ofc
2023-04-21 15:58:19,"Love how ""Langchain it"" is becoming a verb here"
2023-04-21 16:45:37,"Am sorry if I'm missing something here. What's new in this? Isn't this what we have been doing in most LLM apps? Just feed the context. Model won't ""learn"" anything."
2023-04-21 16:47:39,"In context learning examples include input/output pairs, not just stuffing data into the prompt"
2023-04-21 16:53:09,There is an interesting Microsoft paper that checks the values at various layers of the transformer when giving examples in the prompt vs fine tuning the models with the same examples for 1 epoch. They find similar values in both and have a theory that prompting with examples causes implicit gradient descent which helps the model perform on the unseen example.

2023-04-23 09:35:31,Depends if your friend would like to get more into theory or hands on applications
2023-04-23 09:35:54,most devs want hands on first i think

2023-04-23 16:53:01,"He then goes on to say that the “paper”, the code, and the twitter thread as well, were all created with ChatGPT"

2023-04-23 16:53:36,https://yoheinakajima.com/asymmetrix-asymmetric-vector-embeddings-for-directional-similarity-search/
2023-04-23 16:55:56,Not fluff. Nakajima has been tinkering with AGI for long
2023-04-23 16:56:43,"Yep. I was referring to this new technique for vector search which he came up with, or chatgpt came up with"
2023-04-23 17:11:30,Lol. He literally said he has idea what it does.
2023-04-23 17:13:43,Well I didn’t say he didn’t knew what he’s talking about or that what he’s speaking is fluff.
2023-04-23 17:15:09,"Yep. Still assimilating. Atleast from a reco system lens can comment : in theory, this can potentially be a good approach"

2023-04-23 20:41:41,This would be helpful - looking for an AD/Director of ML for my team too 🙌🏼
2023-04-23 20:42:31,How about a board that takes natural language input from job seekers and start-ups and matches them? Does something like this exist? Shouldn't be hard to build one.
2023-04-23 20:43:07,Looking to hire folks as well - full time or part time! Job board would be ideal
2023-04-23 20:44:18,"I knew tokens used for non English languages is different but looking at the OpenAI bills, it gave me a shock. Some Asian languages take a lot more - is there a comparsion somewhere?"
2023-04-23 21:11:16,Oh it’s ridiculous. 
2023-04-23 21:16:54,I haven’t come across a lang2lang comparison. But openAi has a tokenizer you can use to estimate tokens and build a comparison set.
2023-04-23 21:21:12,"For tokenization and word embeddings to reduce cost, you may like to use Sentence Transformers / [ something like that ] and pass the Embeddings to OpenAI for completion"

2023-04-24 12:25:00,"If I remember correctly, but I might be wrong, OpenAI requires you to be 18 years old to use ChatGPT in particular. OpenAI doesn't release any demographic data around it. That aside, pretty sure students are using it. @919741011105 mentioned how his daughter's friends are using it."

2023-04-24 13:47:28,"Yeah, by default, workshops will be paid. Upto the educator to price them. Can set this up early May and ask here :)"
2023-04-24 14:05:56,"So the way me and Nirant have been thinking to structure like 1 product/usage/use-case talk, 1 deep dive into some engg optimisations/libraries/use-cases and 1 deep dive into fundamentals."

2023-04-24 14:56:41,"Hey @919940474056 can you explain a bit on ""creating realistic images"" specifically what would be the topics on this. Is it prompt oriented or model oriented or something else?"
2023-04-24 15:35:13,Sure works - was thinking this would be similar to Amod’s talk but can do a paid workshop too
2023-04-24 15:35:22,Makes sense
2023-04-24 15:35:28,Both - but mostly model oriented and more complex dreambooth methods

2023-04-24 21:18:05,Has anyone noticed differences between using newlines/replacing them when using openai's embedding api?
2023-04-24 21:19:33,"While you're at it, @919892274454 and I'd love to know why Langchain does a newline replacement too 😅"
2023-04-24 21:38:07,\n is probably not a token in the vocabulary
2023-04-24 21:42:31,Creating a token from an unknown world and having it in the vocabulary is different. The model’s vocabulary are words that it understands to encode into something meaningful in the encoder.
2023-04-24 21:43:47,Can you elaborate or rephrase a bit? I didn't understand
2023-04-24 21:44:49,https://www.livemint.com/companies/start-ups/indian-engineering-colleges-lead-generative-ai-research-projects-in-indic-languages-facing-challenges-in-data-sourcing-and-computing-power-11681663553393.html
2023-04-24 21:46:12,"Let’s take a NLP model from huggingface which follows the transformer library specification. It will have a vocab file in it, you will see the vocabulary of the model, words  it was trained to encode. New line, tabs are not part of vocabulary."
2023-04-24 21:46:41,So while a newline could be a token it doesn’t have any semantic meaning when it’s encoded.
2023-04-24 21:47:35,"Aaah, that'd make sense. Thanks for explaining!"
2023-04-24 21:49:43,"So to rephrase the original question —  if we have the original vocab file for GPT3.5 and that has a newline, adding/removing it makes a semantic difference and vice versa?"
2023-04-24 21:54:11,"If the vocabulary has new lines, you could keep them. But for all practical purposes I haven’t seen models contain any space, tab or new lines in models"
2023-04-24 21:54:31,You will use up tokens and not get any advantage in terms of results
2023-04-24 21:54:40,"Sometimes, new line matters for text splitting/ chunking. (Such as splitting by para). Then the /n has meaning, correct?"
2023-04-24 21:55:11,I'm referring to text splitting pre-embedding
2023-04-24 21:55:51,Those are character splitters. Yeah they look into these control characters.
2023-04-24 21:56:51,"The assumption from the model author is that you would split texts the way you see fit and then remove unknown vocabulary, tokenize and then feed the texts into the model."
2023-04-24 21:57:58,*text splitters
2023-04-24 22:02:52,My approach for choosing splitting and sanitizing texts would be to run some experiments and see what preserves or improved the performance of the model with the least number of tokens.
2023-04-24 22:03:23,Context length obviously plays a role also. Can’t go longer than ctx supported.
2023-04-24 22:03:31,might be the reason for the extra tokens too? As the new line + word is not recognised as a common enough token
2023-04-24 22:04:26,You could look into the source code of the tiktoken library on GitHub to see how they are doing it. It’s purely heuristics.
2023-04-24 22:04:50,The tokenizer is called C100k or something
2023-04-24 22:05:49,gpt-4 uses a different tokenizer but they haven't updated the url you linked with that.
2023-04-24 22:06:51,yes

2023-04-24 22:25:35,responded*
2023-04-24 22:26:07,Worked in pose estimation (egomotion/SLAM etc) and deployed in few places. Dabbled in human pose at some point but not up to date with lit. You can DM. Not much in mocap/face-body reconstruction.
2023-04-24 23:02:11,How did you do this?
2023-04-24 23:08:16,We did something very similar for the hackathon - there are some good voice models out there
2023-04-24 23:22:28,Holy shit! Let’s go Arib. Arib hooked me up with a free ticket to a Sam Altman session. What a great dude
2023-04-24 23:24:34,This thing is going to take over the world.
2023-04-24 23:58:21,Sounds legit ! Can you repost your hackathon link? 
2023-04-25 00:11:07,what are some cool chatgpt related chrome extensions y'all have come across?
2023-04-25 00:35:19,V. interesting read on potential to use RL without human feedback: https://gist.github.com/yoavg/6bff0fecd65950898eba1bb321cfbd81

2023-04-25 01:02:32,One of my sideprojects is a bot that's trained on my bumble chats to reply like me....so that I can focus exclusively on AI 😝 and not be bothered to text-back during the week. And just be presented with a date on the weekend.
2023-04-25 01:02:46,For that I had to make a chrome extension that can read all my chats
2023-04-25 01:05:13,"she: you're so fun, so when do we go out?"
2023-04-25 01:05:42,🤣🤣🤣🤣🤣
2023-04-25 01:06:03,No it's trained exclusively to type like me with a super low temperature
2023-04-25 01:06:24,I don't want to come across as someone I'm not

2023-04-25 01:15:32,Next feature is a vector search on all the girls I've swiped right in the past and autoswiping on girls that cross a certain similarity threshold. Will apply to their images and also their textual information like bios.
2023-04-25 01:16:37,It's still in POC stage 😝
2023-04-25 01:16:55,can those occur in my context?
2023-04-25 01:17:14,Damn exactly what I was looking for
2023-04-25 01:21:07,idk honestly. yours is also low temp. so maybe more difficult than usual? my understanding is that most prompt injection out there is tested on the default temperature 0.7
2023-04-25 01:23:42,"If anyone wants/needs help on prompt injection, please send me your model. I enjoy interacting with LLMs to trick them into breaking things."
2023-04-25 01:34:31,Will do once I'm out of POC stage
2023-04-25 01:35:13,Yeah plus the training dataset is made from my chats

2023-04-25 13:17:14,Not perfectly though
2023-04-25 13:17:55,Is fine tuning necessary?
2023-04-25 13:18:29,I did kind of a similar approach to create diagrams using MermaidJS. Created embeddings from the docs and added gpt-3.5. Worked well for the most part
2023-04-25 13:20:38,Most of these components have several parameters that they accept that define the behaviour of the UI component.
2023-04-25 13:22:09,Plan of action that I have in mind:
2023-04-25 13:25:49,"Afaik, fine tuning is only available for base models not for RLHF'ed/SFT models. So you may see degradation in performance."

2023-04-25 13:53:38,Haha great idea - how did you train it?
2023-04-25 14:05:32,Haven't done it yet. Still trying to improve the chrome extension to make it smoother to use.
2023-04-25 14:28:24,I got access to this. Haven’t installed yet

2023-04-25 14:57:36,Try out Weaviate if it fits your needs. We're using Weaviate with 15 million+ vectors. Good performance with normal index-wide vector search as well as pre-filtered vector search. 
2023-04-25 14:59:37,Haha

2023-04-25 18:35:34,The toolkit says coming soon
2023-04-25 18:36:16,something that’s already here - fixie.ai
2023-04-25 18:38:49,doesnt this look like godmode.space (or just AutoGPT in general)?
2023-04-25 18:38:54,Fixie's SDK is pretty powerful
2023-04-25 18:39:36,has anyone used AutoGPT (or its derivatives) for anything useful so far? Let me know if there are some projects that do this.
2023-04-25 18:41:07,have you used this?
2023-04-25 18:41:23,"I have, a bit"
2023-04-25 18:41:40,Worked for the 30 mins i played with it
2023-04-25 18:47:22,How are you running it on prod? Docker? Is it a cluster?
2023-04-25 18:48:06,"The concept is fun, but I haven’t really found it useful."
2023-04-25 18:54:00,"It's a cluster, but we're using their managed SaaS service WCS, https://weaviate.io/developers/weaviate/installation/weaviate-cloud-services"
2023-04-25 18:59:22,"Just out of curiosity, why not?"
2023-04-25 19:02:35,"depends on the application I guess? I generally use it for paraphrasing (for which chatgpt suffices) and coding (where none of these models work very well - haven't tried GPT4 which some people claim is much better, but more expensive too)"
2023-04-25 19:19:47,"why not? at least thats the idea wit medical AI, as of now humans by nature will not trust AI diagnosis any more than a human doctor's diagnosis. AI assisted healthcare makes sense from both effort minimization and improving patient outcome"

2023-04-25 21:03:44,Open Source (Llama 30B-based) rival to ChatGPT from Huggingface:
2023-04-25 21:03:59,Must be WA blue 🤣
2023-04-25 21:06:11,You're welcome :P Did this via apple app on mac in case there's an actual constraint on other devices :P
2023-04-25 21:26:21,"Fine tuning vs sending long, detailed prompts is a very interesting topic/Product design requirement"
2023-04-25 21:28:27,My biz perspective is use out of box to test if it will give a satisfactory but not great output and then build your moat via fine tuning once the use case starts having traction. 
2023-04-25 21:28:46,Added Q to above:
2023-04-25 21:28:47,*satisfactory output
2023-04-25 21:28:49,https://manifold.markets/IsaacKing/will-any-llm-have-a-context-window
2023-04-25 21:29:07,Related discussion here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35682424
2023-04-25 21:31:02,"Interesting, are we saying that few-shot in-context learning is how FMs will be deployed in production?"
2023-04-25 21:31:30,"Noob question: I work at an education company. We finetuned chatgpt's davinci model on some of our content to see if it can create good new content. Results so far are fairly poor, and I'm wondering if this should be expected since gpt-3.5 and gpt-4 significantly raised the bar from previous versions? Has anyone else seen sub-par quality output from finetuned models? Are there other options (such as Huggingface transformers) that might work better?"
2023-04-25 21:31:50,Particularly when the context window will support 32K or 100K+ tokens which can fit all fine tuning data ?
2023-04-25 21:32:09,How do we think of expenses?
2023-04-25 21:32:27,More input tokens would mostly mean more expensive API calls?
2023-04-25 21:33:25,Expenses is ~ # of context window tokens to and fro on OpenAI atleast
2023-04-25 21:33:45,"My understanding so far is that GPT 4 especially is very capable for most use cases with few shot in-context learning. So would be easier to test and learn like this, figure the nuances of the use case and then evaluate smaller fine tuned models."
2023-04-25 21:33:53,Makes sense. With that in mind 1M tokens of context will be much worse on $ than fine tuning maybe.
2023-04-25 21:35:01,But say we were using an open source model (Llama? alpaca? Of the future) where pricing isn’t a factor of token count. The large context window approach will work better with more flexibility?
2023-04-25 21:35:46,Open question still - anyone tried both approaches?
2023-04-25 21:37:25,(Adding to what Karan said)
2023-04-25 21:41:45,I think it's a function of Product maturity
2023-04-25 21:45:00,"If it's a multi tenant setup, I think it's better to finetune on the combined data for all tenants and then use few-shot prompting to refine for every customer."
2023-04-25 21:49:59,"Umm, if I'm a chatbot/conversational AI company and have competing customers (say Axis and HDFC) as my clientele, I'd likely have a base model and fine-tuned (forked) versions of the same running inside the environments of Axis and HDFC"
2023-04-25 21:52:02,The former use-case was via anecdotal research
2023-04-25 21:53:06,How much are we seeing Indian clients caring about their data being used for model training? Is it just regulatory heavy industries like banking or are non-reg industries saying the same? (Eg Ed-tech)
2023-04-25 21:53:40,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370213628_Scaling_Transformer_to_1M_tokens_and_beyond_with_RMT
2023-04-25 21:54:23,Personal experience from a limited sample set - more about the use-case than regulations
2023-04-25 21:58:44,"I think no ML product company can exist if *none* of their customers are ready to share their data for training purposes. So let's say big banks like Axis and HDFC are not ready, then the base model can't be trained on their data. But smaller banks might be ready to share their data for a lower price of implementation etc. (assuming this). So base model can be trained on the banks using the lower pricing tier and few shot prompting etc can be used for the Axis and HDFCs of the world, on-premise to make it work for their data. "
2023-04-25 22:00:23,Also important to build a differentiated solution. Else anyone can create the wrapper without fine tuning
2023-04-25 22:01:32,Well said. We have a similar vision - start with embeddings and then at some point fine tune per client (maybe per team)
2023-04-25 22:01:36,Precisely why AI has higher marginal costs (and poorer GMs) than traditional cloud software
2023-04-25 22:03:29,You can get away with embeddings right? So there’s no training?
2023-04-25 22:10:21,discussing this for a complicated usecase where finetuning is required in some capacity. So pureplay embeddings and few shot prompting won't work is the assumption here.
2023-04-25 22:12:45,"Those models doesn't not have RLHF etc, not just smaller models. So you will be seeing perf similar to GPT3 and some more: your fine tuning. You will need other models and then train RLHF or use one of the RLHF trained models and try. Haven't done the last part. You will most likely need to fine tune RLHF as well, as the new models might have drifted in the output space."
2023-04-25 22:16:55,"Very true. But at the same time all these companies are trusting MS, Goog and AWS with their data. One of our customers, large multinational, had absolute 'no' few weeks ago to if you can provide guarantee, nothing will be leaked, you can use OpenAI. Unfortunately, OpenAI fine print isn't that black and white."
2023-04-25 22:17:33,What's the exact fine print that is difficult to decipher?
2023-04-25 22:18:16,"From what I understand, context is the application's and not Open AIs but want to understand this further."
2023-04-25 22:18:35,Tell them they’ll loose everything when their competition uses chatgpt to outperform them 😗😝
2023-04-25 22:19:30,Scare is definitely one approach haha :D
2023-04-25 22:19:31,And it took the big 3 15 odd years to instil this trust
2023-04-25 22:20:10,"Or tell them you’re using azure, azure has like a direct passthrough of gpt"
2023-04-25 22:20:16,"Used replicate and runpod.io, would recommend both for serverless and stateful use cases"
2023-04-25 22:20:19,"In typical Amazon fashion, better selection inside a VPC that customers trust with Anthropic which is possibly the biggest competitor to OAI today"
2023-04-25 22:23:07,"It feels like a good tool for scaffolding, but also a bit blind. The way the repo is also feels limiting. "
2023-04-25 22:24:25,"Their wordings are something like ""OpenAI may use content to provide and maintain services"". What he heard from an OpenAI engineer was won't be used for training* (*to be verified by the engineer). Don't know if Nirant or others heard an update from their team."

2023-04-25 22:31:04,"Open AI engineer Boris Power - ""Prompting leads to faster results, with fine tuning it's painful to edit with changing data. Use fine tuning for exact format of input and output and if you have lots of historical high quality data. New use cases - fine tuning acts a lot of cost. Fine tuning doesn't do well when you need to understand facts and then provide the output"""
2023-04-25 22:33:01,Thanks for this. Could be helpful for us.
2023-04-25 22:33:32,They did say in an email that all data is deleted within 30 days and it’s not used for training
2023-04-25 23:03:18,https://openai.com/blog/new-ways-to-manage-your-data-in-chatgpt - turnoff chat history on chatgpt
2023-04-25 23:06:34,Already did this. Like how this is fine print on the website since Sam said the purpose of releasing chatgpt to the world was (high frequency / diverse) user feedback.
2023-04-25 23:07:55,*this was
2023-04-25 23:54:09,"Openai doesn't need customer data to improve models at this stage.    No data sent over api by platform customers has ever been used.  When asked about it, they said they are just keeping the data around for 30 days for trust and safety."
2023-04-26 00:27:45,"OpenAI not needing data: Highly doubt that claim, they like everyone else would happily take more data. Esp when they are out of training data for GPT (they have exhausted text data). But also as feedback for fine-tuning layers like RLHF. The key there is they don't use API day, chatting on website probably will be used as is (which they say as well, in the free version). Ideally if they really don't need data, they should give a zero knowledge guarantee. They don't use input or output. But could they use intermediate layer info, can their folks eyeball it to improve the system. All those are probably open questions."
2023-04-26 00:30:14,I think multinationals too will move to start using them. Their models are quite good and it is just a matter of time.
2023-04-26 00:36:21,"They do need more data, just not api platform customer data."
2023-04-26 00:37:49,Data Partnership: Interesting.
2023-04-26 00:51:43,Anyone have a list of data partners for Open AI?
2023-04-26 00:54:48,Nah... They don't talk about how they train their new models either in terms of data or architecture...  Their platform api  data policy is public info though...
2023-04-26 09:29:54,"I spent a day in march at openai office when they have invited some startups. They are very much looking to get more data to train their models from the industry because they have exhausted internet and academic datasets. However their organization is so small that they are able to cater to partnership proposals only from the biggest tech companies right now, all of which are lining up at their door.

2023-04-26 11:20:28,The UX of consuming models was not great up until openai came into the picture.
2023-04-26 11:22:15,Still kinda sad that HF hasn't learned this well enough tbh
2023-04-26 11:22:56,"Once we have a well supported IR which works across all platforms, serving and consuming models from source would become a lot easier too."
2023-04-26 11:23:54,They were born at a different time. Compared to their competition at that time(2017-18) they have done well.
2023-04-26 11:24:49,Almost everyone who does NLP now makes their models work their transformer library.
2023-04-26 11:25:08,In 2018 we spent half a day finding out how to use a model someone trained lol

2023-04-26 18:38:49,"Might not be applicable for everyone, but I think by far the fastest and best experience would be to apply for google cloud startup credits, and use a dedicated A100 for colab."
2023-04-26 18:39:25,Jupiter on VS Code with Banana on backend will cost ₹150/hour. 
2023-04-26 18:39:43,^ banana.dev also has a great free tier for 1 hour of use
2023-04-26 18:40:30,Should still be good for tinkering use-cases I'd guess?
2023-04-26 18:40:36,Really nice for notebooks / automation / scripting 
2023-04-26 18:41:40,Yes. Community model templates allow one click deployment. For 50+ models. Simple docs.

2023-04-26 18:43:37,I want to experiment with deploying StableDiffusion and running Gradio/Automatic1111 ... will also want to keep some of the models like Lyriel / Deliberate + Controlnets  etc .. so need storage ~50GB ... I'm newbie to serverless .. but I don't think serverless GPUs will cut it for this usecase
2023-04-26 18:46:27,"You can try paperspace, they are undercutting big tech on GPUs. https://www.paperspace.com"
2023-04-26 18:46:50,they have 5GB space on the Gradient .. 🙁
2023-04-26 18:47:59,Google Colab is $12 - and 50GB
2023-04-26 18:50:19,I have been using my Mac Pro as a server at home + socket + multiple LMs. Works like a charm :)
2023-04-26 18:51:25,You can keep the model storage on hugging face and then use any serverless gpu player to import your model from there directly.
2023-04-26 18:52:06,Will try this !
2023-04-26 19:40:26,"This doesn't work, start up credits cannot be used for colab, they have separate billing"

2023-04-26 23:12:34,whats the major difference between storing it in vector dbs and something like a numpy array? is retrieval super fast for say 1000s of vectors
2023-04-26 23:13:53,"Yep, our app allows users embed content so we need containerization + expect this to increase significantly (🤞). If you are building a vertical app (only embedding content yourself), numpy is probably ok - others probably have a better view tho"

2023-04-27 08:47:07,bumping - has anyone been able to solve?
2023-04-27 08:48:56,I faced this problem before. We used some form of leaky bucket to smoothen the API calling rate.
2023-04-27 08:50:03,Not particularly for OpenAI but for a general solution for limiting API calling rates.
2023-04-27 08:53:43,"429s, use the retry-after. Are you getting rate limited for requests or tokenS?"
2023-04-27 08:55:17,all types of errors now. I wish there was a middle layer to solve this

2023-04-27 09:48:17,Any proxies like Nginx with Lua JIT or Envoy with WASM/Lua can be used for production setup without adding any much latency and performance overhead.
2023-04-27 09:49:22,Can you elaborate and/or share links? Hearing about Lua JIT and WASM in this context for the first time 😅

2023-04-27 09:55:46,https://tetrate.io/blog/wasm-modules-and-envoy-extensibility-explained-part-1/
2023-04-27 09:58:49,"These enovy, istio, nginx are API proxy and they have a customised layer where we can add multiple filters. These filters can extend functionality. Which you can write in Lua, Wasm etc. Lua interpreters bring less overhead and way faster than python interpreter."
2023-04-27 10:04:50,Things like if you are testing multiple models on production one is main other are tests. And you like to send prod requests to all and then like to monitor outcomes. For this generally you need to write code. But in the case of these proxies you simply need to write small Lua or even yaml. And this proxy itself sends requests to all these services (which host models) and passes the response of the main service to the caller/client.

2023-04-27 11:02:33,"Think of a continuous model training process with multiple forks, each ""named"" or versioned model is a actually a checkpoint in that. "
2023-04-27 11:03:32,"Workflow wise: Say you build on 0314 or any other 3 month model, when it gets deprecated, you have to explicitly upgrade and you'll be prepared to run your entire battery of tests again. This is better than a silent upgrade where the behaviour of underlying model changes silently."
2023-04-27 11:03:36,Does this help?
2023-04-27 11:06:38,Yes but basis this tweet https://twitter.com/raj_raj88/status/1631018786492157954 my understanding is 3.5-turbo refers to the latest model 3.5-turbo-x 
2023-04-27 11:07:20,"Let me move this to DM, need to understand your query better 😅"
2023-04-27 12:08:45,"Might be useful for you,i was trying to train a Bloom model  and i was running out of GPU memory..and this gradient notebook helped me https://github.com/rasbt/gradient-accumulation-blog/blob/main/src/1_batchsize-1.py where if we want to use a batch size of 256 but can only fit a batch size of 64 into GPU memory, we can perform gradient accumulation over four batches of size 64. (After processing all four batches, we will have the accumulated gradients equivalent to a single batch of size 256.) This allows us to effectively emulate a larger batch size without requiring larger GPU memory or tensor sharding across different devices."
2023-04-27 12:17:07,"As I have mentioned, tried all possible combinations with gradient accumulation as well. Problem is of memory leak"
2023-04-27 12:40:01,If you are facing GPU constraints you can try using the quantized version and fine tuning using lora+ bits and bytes

2023-04-27 13:59:44,This is optional but might turn out to be cheaper if you are using it for high-velocity use cases. I have tried the Automatic1111 on SD V1.5 and is pretty decent for playing around.

2023-04-28 13:00:55,Did it actually do anything useful yet? Haven't seen any impressive results so far.
2023-04-28 13:02:15,AutoGPT has been major disappointment from the hype prospective
2023-04-28 13:04:08,it is only aboe to do small things/tasks with bounded scopes and well-defined goals

2023-04-28 13:09:58,"This could be a stupid question but beyond customisability (and maybe power), what's the difference between bing (powered by GPT) and AutoGPT for basic questions? Both have access to the latest information through search."

2023-04-28 13:19:28,"Bing has a lot longer context window — so can reason over more search results, is basically free for most people, easier to use."
2023-04-28 13:19:43,"AutoGPT took all the learnings developed by langchain, vectors DBs etc etc and made it available for the wider non-developer audience to use in the format they understand better. "
2023-04-28 13:19:45,Bing is also not powered 100% by GPT but uses an internal MSFT model quite often

2023-04-28 17:03:15,For folks wondering how is FP8 working? This is based on NVIDIA's Transformer Engine: https://docs.nvidia.com/deeplearning/transformer-engine/user-guide/index.html
2023-04-28 17:05:12,"What impact you foresee? Large Model, Faster Model, or new model arch?"
2023-04-28 17:13:48,Coreweave talks about tier 3 datacenters in north america. What does that mean? Do we have any in India as well?
2023-04-28 17:22:28,"Mostly faster inference in the 3-6 month horizon as compute providers figure this out, and perhaps more Fp16, Fp8/int8 proliferation for task-specific models"
2023-04-28 17:55:41,Faster inference means lesser costs because you can handle higher concurrent users per gpu
2023-04-28 19:04:39,"If I was running a serverless GPU company with mixed-GPUs e.g. A100, H100, P100 and what not — I'd resist the temptation to pass on these cost savings to customers. Mainly because I'm not quite sure how many customers will pay for 3x faster use cases"
2023-04-28 19:10:25,"Also at times you can’t guarantee to spawn up some of the higher end GPUs on demand, leading to slower spawn up time for users"
2023-04-28 19:10:57,"I doubt you'll have this luxury for long, imo serverless gpus are a perfect competition model with market competition dictating  the pricing instead of arbitrary end user value"

2023-04-29 00:49:44,Very lame question: Does LlamaIndex or Langchain support VectorDB with Sources with GPT4 or GPT3.5-Turbo? 
2023-04-29 00:50:52,"If yes, can you please point me to the right docs 😅"
2023-04-29 00:51:00,what does vectordb with sources with gpt mean?
2023-04-29 00:52:31,"Say the Vector DB replies with Doc1, 3, 5, 7 and only 5, 7 are actually used by the LLM to answer the question — I want the response to include 5, 7"
2023-04-29 00:53:25,https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/examples/vector_indices/PineconeIndexDemo.ipynb
2023-04-29 00:53:50,response.source_nodes should give you the sources.
2023-04-29 00:54:12,"That gives 1, 3, 5, 7 — all top k"
2023-04-29 00:55:27,"ohh okay. Sorry, I misunderstood then. One way is to use evaluation module on top these to get only 5, 7 are being used."
2023-04-29 00:56:54,I have a hack for this
2023-04-29 00:57:36,Use this prompt - 
2023-04-29 00:57:55,Then simply parse the citations returned using regex
2023-04-29 00:58:26,I've tried variants of this. Not consistent enough unfortunately across questions. Do you change the system prompt in some way?
2023-04-29 00:59:54,Works very consistently
2023-04-29 01:00:10,(Haven't experimented with gpt-4 though yet)
2023-04-29 01:01:11,Including instructions and search results in system prompt made it forget the instructions sometimes
2023-04-29 01:01:23,So moved them to user prompt
2023-04-29 01:05:33,"This technique also in my experience has the added benefit of producing more grounded results, because you are kinda forcing it to cite sources. (Not sure why it works at all though)"
2023-04-29 01:22:00,OpenAI models don’t do this. What you want is basically the LLMs to cite references.
2023-04-29 01:22:19,*The reader model
2023-04-29 01:23:10,Interesting.
2023-04-29 01:25:42,@917737887058 something like this - https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/chains/index_examples/qa_with_sources.html ?
2023-04-29 01:27:35,"Yes, but this uses text-davinci-003 — which leads to couple of trade offs:  "
2023-04-29 01:31:15,"what could be reasons that the methodology can’t be ported to GPT-4? (I haven’t looked at the code yet, only did a cursory read on this today)"
2023-04-29 01:32:40,Do you mean LLM or code reasons? There are no LLM reasons
2023-04-29 01:33:29,Replacing the OpenAI() classes in the example with ChatOpenAI() doesn't work?
2023-04-29 01:33:51,Code reasons - is the “return_only_outputs” prop not available for ChatCompletions
2023-04-29 01:33:53,Code Reasons: Langchain is structured around separation of LLMs and Vector Indices — the Chat LLMs (e.g. ```ChatOpenAI```) prompts aren't compatible with these other operands like qa_with_sources
2023-04-29 01:34:30,You’ll have to extend the chain functions I guess..
2023-04-29 01:34:37,"Llama Index: @919550164716 can share more context, but I think they've just gotten around to it. From what I can tell, they have no such limitations"

2023-04-29 01:35:08,"Aah, that makes sense. Will make for a great PR!"
2023-04-29 01:35:35,That was a quick delete 😂😂😂
2023-04-29 01:36:13,"Yeah, sometimes I've to enforce that ""stay on topic"" policy to myself 🤣"
2023-04-29 01:36:29,Langchain is very complex though. Tried doing some very simple modifications today and I just gave up and went back to good old OpenAI libs
2023-04-29 01:36:42,"My eyes can’t believe this, what error does it throw?"
2023-04-29 01:36:46,It's definitely not meant for simple things
2023-04-29 01:38:15,OpenAI has a function in one of their libs to convert chat prompts to text ones and vice versa - that’s needed here I guess 😅
2023-04-29 01:38:48,"Wait, what. I've not seen this. Is this part of their default Python SDK? If not, can you link it here?"

2023-04-29 08:42:15,No way. Shouldn't expect that from Nirant. Automate. 😁
2023-04-29 08:44:50,This is a nice read
2023-04-29 08:57:43,Mainly my point about finding any good way to extract WhatsApp group data  automatically. I don't find any official APIs. There might be few unofficial ways but that may cause a number ban.

2023-04-29 16:00:24,For Hindi there are whisper models trained for Hindi from IITM.
2023-04-29 16:00:26,Deepgram built using whisper works good as well. They give $200 credit to try it out.
2023-04-29 16:37:06,You can try monster api as well
2023-04-29 16:50:00,If somebody is trying out deepgram nova vs Whisper - would love to hear results from both
2023-04-29 17:02:46,You don't need generative models for this. Converting raw text to PDFs/images and then applying simple distortions is a very common and effective way to get synthetic data for OCR.

2023-04-29 19:22:26,Weekend fun!
2023-04-29 19:35:59,D-ID is crazy good. Any ideas on the underlying architecture?
2023-04-29 19:38:31,SadTalker is open and it getting there. Some friends are working on a project and they moved on from D-ID for SadTalker. You will need a good GPU though.
2023-04-29 19:41:33,Not so sure but this tech is around since a while.
2023-04-29 19:42:04,Not zero shot lipsync / animation - that's hard and has limited work
2023-04-29 19:45:47,Sad talker is arguably better...
2023-04-29 19:48:41,D-ID is very expensive if you’re building a project with a pipeline to generate content on an enormous amount.
2023-04-29 19:50:24,How expensive?
2023-04-29 19:52:00,As mentioned on their Pricing page. 🤣
2023-04-29 19:52:34,Have you deployed and tested at scale?
2023-04-29 19:52:41,Unreasonably expensive for an api product
2023-04-29 19:52:48,We used multiple D-ID accounts to get this done :p
2023-04-29 19:53:43,They have a full fledged web studio as well.
2023-04-29 19:54:10,Yup exactly - I feel like the pricing is aligned for the dashboard only
2023-04-29 19:54:34,Right now SadTalker can generate 10min video per hour that’s 2$ GPU time
2023-04-29 19:57:47,"D-ID is charging 6$ per 10 mins. If you can have 3090 or 4090 at home, that would be like 300-400h gpu time to get your money back."
2023-04-29 20:00:13,May be get one with nvlinks for larger runs and still it’s a lot better return time for investment
2023-04-29 20:00:49,And yet has a lot of traction - good product to build.
2023-04-29 20:01:06,Any idea on what models they use?
2023-04-29 20:01:40,🤷‍♂️ their own. SadTalker is new and evolving. From tencent I think.
2023-04-29 20:09:12,"So many things to build, so many industries to disrupt. "
2023-04-29 20:14:32,Just ran it - seeing that its running gfpgan at the end too - so this time can definitely be reduced
2023-04-29 20:17:09,👍 
2023-04-29 20:29:40,Only notes (as of now)
2023-04-29 20:36:00,Yes and 2$ can be brought down if doing at scale (Assuming A100)
2023-04-29 20:36:28,Margins are great for this - and competition is less. (text to talking head avatars vs rephrase ai etc). Good product to build.
2023-04-29 20:36:41,I'll take a stab at building an mvp soon
2023-04-29 20:37:03,"Tried doing this back in 2019 and almost raised funding, but didn't work out"
2023-04-29 20:37:11,Not sure how big is the market for this though.
2023-04-29 20:37:42,It's an evolving market. Also look at leading indicators
2023-04-29 20:38:17,Wow this is very real

2023-04-29 20:45:47,Thinking XYZ movie in Nolan style. Or personalized standup making references about my own personal life - that might really work.

2023-04-30 10:42:04,basic project idea:
2023-04-30 10:42:11,shortcuts are super useful if you know what you're doing
2023-04-30 10:42:26,Most people don't use them to their full potential since the documentation is so messy
2023-04-30 10:43:34,"Can be a vague, small step towards AGI for the common-man."
2023-04-30 10:44:14,"Would love to get a functionality like : ""Create shortcuts to automatically change my wallpaper based on 7 images, 1 for each day of the week"""
2023-04-30 10:44:38,One of my friends set up something like that and it took him 2 full hours to get his head around it
2023-04-30 10:54:18,And even generating a step by step guide to make a shortcut should be plenty for people like me

2023-04-30 14:41:56,How do I read this - how’s the recall measured?

2023-05-01 12:01:05,Perhaps a weekly post with all open roles can work better instead of a separate WA group? That makes it easier for all seekers to discover open roles also. 
2023-05-01 12:01:11,The challenge is that posting on LinkedIn has been ineffective for specific areas and GenAI has very few communities.

2023-05-02 10:25:43,Make an extra API call and ask the model which messages are worth keeping up

2023-05-02 11:54:00,My team's working on semantic search to feed in product content to LLMs. Anyone here has worked on Lucene based ANNs with OpenSearch 2.x ?
2023-05-02 11:54:06,"For these use cases, Langchain is still very good"
2023-05-02 11:55:00,Why Lucene/OpenSearch? Have a requirement which prevents you from using a decent VectorDB or Elastic itself?
2023-05-02 11:55:53,For storing chat history isn't llama better? Thought you had some points on this

2023-05-02 11:57:22,@917737887058 any input on the 2nd question?
2023-05-02 11:57:25,"Thanks, I will DM you."
2023-05-02 12:12:51,This is my biggest worry of using LangChain in production env. This is a very active repo lot of PRs being merged but still don't see much quality checks around it (unit and integration tests). Like Haystack and even some part of Transformers repo has which I feel should be required for any production quality codebase.
2023-05-02 12:15:05,"It's not just about backward compatibility. It's also about clarity on what they want to do — Langchain seems to be prioritising agents, tools and toolchain around that over everything else"
2023-05-02 12:31:12,"True we wrote own in js stuff moved away from langchain , will open source soon once we have most basic func"
2023-05-02 12:36:04,Question was around data connectors and indexing: 
2023-05-02 12:49:09,Does deforum have a commercial license?
2023-05-02 13:14:05,interesting - I've been using https://deeplearn.org/ for this
2023-05-02 13:24:15,Has anybody tried Semantic Kernel? Do you see this as langchain alternative? 
2023-05-02 13:38:47,"I don't see it as a Langchain alternative yet (doesn't care about agents, data indexing, tools at all) — but for the few things it does, it does have a cleaner API. I am planning to try it out if a project comes along"
2023-05-02 13:42:00,"Hmm, you're right. I could see Semantic Kernel adding tools, agents as capabilities with a clean-ish API in the short term."
2023-05-02 13:50:06,"But it'd be quite ironical if $MSFT has better API design than a well-funded, immensely popular FOSS project to be honest 🥲"
2023-05-02 13:50:53,yea! heard they raised another round already (not sure about the source though)
2023-05-02 13:54:12,Why though?
2023-05-02 13:54:38,I frankly don’t see any llm abstraction library really working out in the near term. Its like writing a C compiler for a changing chip design and Instruction set before x86
2023-05-02 13:54:48,API design has little to do with community traction I'd believe
2023-05-02 13:55:04,"Say more, I don't understand you"
2023-05-02 13:55:17,"Fun analogy, but the x86 is GPT4 no?"

2023-05-02 14:09:21,What about summarisation? We’ve tried calling the openai summarisation API to summarise the prev chat but it’s slow af
2023-05-02 14:10:14,We need some inside info on how chatgpt is doing this 🫣
2023-05-02 14:10:35,OpenAI has a summarisation API? Didn't they deprecate that?
2023-05-02 14:11:34,"Prompt engineering helps there. Think of your usecases as bucketed modules. Don't use a one size fits all prompt, but smartly create prompts that can preserve needed info. Has been working well for our usecases"
2023-05-02 14:11:41,"Openai once suggested to us in 2020 to use a smaller and faster model for summarisation here, wonder how well that works"
2023-05-02 14:12:04,"It's a trade off, experience vs expense. Have to take that call based on your product."

2023-05-04 11:32:44,I believe Soumendra @917498076111 was giving it a shot
2023-05-04 11:50:10,What do you mean by your own vector embeddings?
2023-05-04 11:50:23,How are you generating them?
2023-05-04 11:52:19,Thanks for responding. I am not using any of the prebuilt vectorizers.

2023-05-04 12:26:12,"Yes, separate collections is perhaps the cleanest way? "

2023-05-04 13:17:51,Average out the embeddings for the document
2023-05-04 13:18:25,Are you predicting related keywords for a given text and then clustering somehow ?
2023-05-04 13:19:39,"For most prompts it's usually semantic keyword matching, in some scenarios there can be some logic involved"
2023-05-04 13:20:02,"Shyam, a few details which will help us answer your question better: "
2023-05-04 13:20:46,Could you describe your approach ?
2023-05-04 13:20:47,"Example, if the user is prompting 'x of 10%', but the data point has the absolute value of that variable, then some logic will be needed."
2023-05-04 13:22:03,"We don't implement the matching, because the prompts are varied as I mentioned, we are directly feeding the data and prompt to gpt-3"
2023-05-04 13:23:43,Is there a reason for using text-davinci-003 and NOT gpt3.5-turbo?

2023-05-04 13:32:59,Has anybody used langchain or llama index for hybrid embeddings? I was looking through their code to find what they use for sparse embeddings. Llama seems to use BERT and langchain I couldn’t find
2023-05-04 13:33:22,The error was the Vectors were not inserted properly. The correct code [ highly simplified is here]
2023-05-04 13:33:25,with client.batch as batch:
2023-05-04 13:33:50,Vector =  < Place your VECTOR embeddings here>
2023-05-04 13:34:43,"Llama Index has extensible Retrievers, so shouldn't matter either way no?"
2023-05-04 13:34:56,Thanks to  Soumendra @+91 74980 76111  for trying yo help me
2023-05-04 13:36:17,Thank you for your interest. I used simple Python and Weavite librarues
2023-05-04 13:37:19,Thanks Sharding is another good way.
2023-05-04 13:37:48,Ah got it. So BERT was just an example
2023-05-04 13:38:00,Found haystack to be great btw. the code is same for embedding insert and retrieval independent of the vector store you use.
2023-05-04 13:38:19,cc @919741011105 was a Haystack contributor :)
2023-05-04 13:38:36,"Yeah, Llama Index has decent Retriever design. Some Custom examples: https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/examples/query/CustomRetrievers.ipynb"
2023-05-04 13:47:05,"I always had this question, deepset haystack was doing the semantic search pipelines for so long, why langchain became so viral as if some novelty?"
2023-05-04 13:47:56,"Ease of use, right place at right time, became viral too fast before people even knew about alternatives"
2023-05-04 13:48:35,Once the GitHub stars started picking up everyone's eyes were on it.
2023-05-04 13:48:37,Haystack is much better in code quality and documentation imo.
2023-05-04 13:51:05,"Chatgpt helped as well, probably they rode that wave, may be haystack didn't treat chatgpt as urgent requirement"
2023-05-04 13:52:26,"Langchain is not about semantic search, it's about QA, Tools and Agents. In fact, there is no search API in Langchain."
2023-05-04 13:53:12,I mean there is overlap between both
2023-05-04 14:03:59,indexes feels like semantic search interface - https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/getting_started.html
2023-05-04 14:15:39,"Thanks, this discussion helped understanding strengths of langchain and/vs haystack"
2023-05-04 14:27:04,"yeah, just discovered this: https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/document_store because of the discussion here. I was thinking of creating a similar abstraction layer (i.e. provide a single API for vector DBs, allowing any VectorDB to be plugged in), but I might just depend on this now"
2023-05-04 14:29:17,True. Apart from code and documentation. Haystack is very good in design. Just check how haystack implemented PromptNode and compare it with Langchain. You will see the difference.
2023-05-04 14:31:47,"“ This approach is the most flexible, but creating numerous collections may result in resource overhead.  only recommended to separate users into multiple collections if you have a limited number of users “"
2023-05-04 14:33:00,"Agreed. And the vector store abstraction too. Granted it's not perfect, but flexible enough to mould it the way we want."
2023-05-04 14:34:07,100s should be pretty fine from what I've been told internally
2023-05-04 14:34:41,100x100 na
2023-05-04 14:37:52,"Go for sharded approach imo, cluster will take care of fault tolerance, shards will take care of horizontal scaling. It's easy to build."
2023-05-04 14:39:22,"fwiw, all FOSS Vector DBs offer cloud solutions so that you don't have to think about cluster sizing, managing servers, sharding and  problems like what @918075464375 just mentioned"
2023-05-04 14:40:16,Build vs Buy 😄
2023-05-04 14:50:27,Vitess is a great tool.
2023-05-04 15:36:38,For folks wondering: https://vitess.io/ is a tool for sharding — and here is a good primer for what sharding means: https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/database-sharding/
2023-05-04 15:42:57,"Have y’all heard of Modular? Chris Lattner’s (authors of LLVM and Swift and programmer extraordinaire) startup that is trying to create a new AI programming language. Jeremy Howard is an adviser, and here he introduces the language. There are cases it is 3000x faster than equivalent Python code for matrix multiplication "
2023-05-04 15:45:11,https://planetscale.com/ does managed Vitess as well. We were exploring it at Razorpay.
2023-05-04 15:45:15,"Reminder: Programming language is called Mojo. It's not Free or Open Source. Given how Java shaped up, I'm wary of using anything without a community around it to maintain and at least do basic security fixes for 5-10 years."
2023-05-04 15:45:58,How did Razorpay end up doing sharding?
2023-05-04 15:46:29,Not being open source at launch was a weird choice...  Can't remember the last time a language launched like that...
2023-05-04 15:50:14,We didn't go ahead in the end. 😅
2023-05-04 16:04:04,Jeremy was a strong proponent of TF Swift as well. But that hasn't seen major adoption even inside G so ymmv

2023-05-04 16:21:12,https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/
2023-05-04 16:21:42,“According to a fun and non-scientific evaluation with GPT-4. Further rigorous evaluation is needed.”
2023-05-04 16:22:06,Exactly!
2023-05-04 16:22:14,Maybe we run openi evals on it :)
2023-05-04 16:24:15,This eval doesn't make any sense to me. Already LLMs capabilities to produce such ranks/marks are highly debated to it's stochastic nature. It's like a teacher that gives a different score each time when she evaluates  answer from a different room
2023-05-04 16:24:39,Yea... independent and good benchmarking of AI needs to be a thing...
2023-05-04 16:26:21,LLM evaluation is an open research question. We have some nlp eval methods like lm-eval-harness but need to improve from that.
2023-05-04 16:28:14,"just to add one more point, alpaca and vinuca are LLAMA derivatives so I don't think it can fit in that graph since they aren't new base LLMs. Also I don't think its good idea to train models on chatgpts output like Alpaca did, if you're curious about the reason:https://twitter.com/Shahules786/status/1650898925178720256"
2023-05-04 16:28:43,"Benchmarking has this weird dynamic of very useful for industry and their labs, but gives no glory to people who make them — so it doesn't attract hackers or academics. "
2023-05-04 16:29:34,Sure... at the research level some objective ones will help but also at the consumer and solutions level... We have a full tech gadget review industry... A similar AI review industry is needed...  This impacts everyone and everything now...

2023-05-04 16:40:54,This is the exact problem with building a tool for Devs 😅
2023-05-04 16:42:41,"Most devs actually have the highest buying power in any organisation. If a developer says they need to pay 100$/mo to keep their database up, that’s a bottom line for a business"
2023-05-04 16:44:41,Devs are the end consumers
2023-05-04 16:46:01,"Hmm, as tempted as I am to chime in and ask questions on how Postman, Stripe, BrowserStack were able to do a dev-first GTM — I'll resist the temptation since this is already off topic for a Generative AI focussed chat 😅"
2023-05-04 16:48:25,"We should jam separately on this, very different problems and implications :)"
2023-05-04 16:48:36,"yeah. fastai was also going to build a tf swift version i think, but all those projects kinda got abandoned when Chris Lattner left Google."
2023-05-04 17:23:41,"Generative Pretraining is the default ""GPT"" training objective, I'll let you dig this up on your own. If you don't mind reading papers, the original Radford et al is still relevant for this. "
2023-05-04 17:28:16,"On a concept level I understand the difference, but while training it, is there a difference? I checked databricks dolly script - https://github.com/databrickslabs/dolly/blob/master/training/trainer.py"
2023-05-04 17:28:19,"For wider audience, the code interpreter is largely a Python REPL and a GPT4-fork finetuned on Python/code. This is not a separate feature or anything like that. "
2023-05-04 17:28:51,Difference in outcomes or syntax/code which we write?
2023-05-04 17:30:51,Syntax/code - essentially the training objective
2023-05-04 17:33:09,"Going out on a limb, but I'd like to think that they should be identical with different configs — finetuning and training objectives are often kept identical these days"
2023-05-04 17:35:49,Understood. So we are still doing next word prediction on instruction dataset. Then how does it learn when to stop?
2023-05-04 17:38:42,Yep. Code interpreter is quite useful.  Threw a csv I had at it and it saved me at least an hour in data clean up if not more...
2023-05-04 17:40:19,Chatgpt code interpreter and gpt-4 browsing models are more useful than I anticipated.
2023-05-04 17:40:40,Guessing — stop word markers in the instruction dataset?
2023-05-04 17:41:35,Are there specific communities/ influencers to follow for generative AI content on Twitter ?I see a lot of content across all groups from Twitter hence asking here
