2023-03-03 15:11:48,Ummm have they released some code?
2023-03-03 15:12:17,I am very skeptical on this. Data from brain to be used for useful things is still in very very early research.
2023-03-03 15:12:26,"Nahi, it's not peer reviewed. Just submitted to some conf I think."

2023-03-03 15:13:11,Coz I have spent a lot of money and time on this 😂
2023-03-03 15:13:22,My rant is my emo :P
2023-03-03 15:13:27,Please elaborate further
2023-03-03 15:13:50,😂😂😂 
2023-03-03 15:13:54,I have bought some 4 such devices over 4 years
2023-03-03 15:14:00,Each costing 25k to 1L :P
2023-03-03 15:14:10,And I was a subject in one such experiment too
2023-03-03 15:14:26,And the data is so noisy and hard to use.
2023-03-03 15:14:41,Like the ones used in hospitals was benchmark for off the shel devices
2023-03-03 15:14:48,"those have 200 probes, you have to be bald"
2023-03-03 15:14:55,and then also it is noisy.
2023-03-03 15:15:07,It works on voltage of neurons. So probes need to be very ver sensitive
2023-03-03 15:15:12,Which is a hard hardware problem
2023-03-03 15:16:28,"They are using fMRI data which has a much stronger signal profile. I participated in a couple of frontal lobe activation expts here, and the data was apparently clean enough to run some pretty interesting analyses."
2023-03-03 15:18:04,Can't we get such data without having a hardware device ?
2023-03-03 15:18:33,That's a near-certain no.
2023-03-03 15:19:38,"What does clean enough and analyses mean here? If it's alright with you, share a couple of examples?"
2023-03-03 15:20:02,I will try and find the paper.
2023-03-03 15:24:56,Non-invasive devices are already pretty noisy compared to brain probes. Without hardware matlab kya?
2023-03-03 15:25:26,"In the meanwhile, the expt was as follows: two sessions of 45 min- 1hr wherein a volunteer (me and 10 others) will lie in an fMRI machine, and solve some logic and language puzzles (they will be projected on a screen and I have to verbalize my answer). They showed me the processed data stream sometime later, and explained that they were going to try and localize activations and their strengths to understand which subsection of the frontal lobe is responsible for the thought. After that, they had planned to run some time-series analyses to see how the activation shifts as the answer is obtained and verbalised (not sure if they ever published this one)."
2023-03-03 17:06:40,"Folks, what are the best videos/resources on using SD for designers (product, UX) and artists? "
2023-03-03 17:07:00,"(Yes, I've already included the anime which plays rock, paper)"
2023-03-03 17:14:59,Automatic1111 is the easiest way to use SD and all of its plugins but requires a GPU to run on local. Plus the setup can be a bit technical. If no GPU then it has to run on Colab which is also technical.

2023-03-06 15:57:00,"really interesting points. [PHONE REMOVED] you guys used pinecone and langchain in the hasura bot for the embedding purpose only, right?"
2023-03-06 15:59:10,Embedding and prompt templating
2023-03-06 15:59:16,But embedding was the biggest reason
2023-03-06 16:00:39,Any specific reason for not using the openai's embedding endpoint other than cost and latency?
2023-03-06 16:00:53,It uses openAI embedding
2023-03-06 16:01:01,Pinecone is used as vector store
2023-03-06 16:01:05,oh ok
2023-03-06 16:01:10,Yeah that's what I would assume
2023-03-06 16:01:14,Langchain gives a good abstraction

2023-03-15 02:03:21,After seeing the OpenAI demo
2023-03-15 02:04:20,the paper wireframe to working code was just 🤯
2023-03-15 02:05:41,"But wouldn't this get used more than anything else? who doesn't have to check email, write docs / make slides"
2023-03-15 02:09:08,I agree. It doesn’t open up loads of possibilities for others to build upon- but enough productivity & note apps are irrelevant after this.
2023-03-15 02:13:34,Loved the wireframe to code demo by OpenAI today
2023-03-15 02:14:04,Really good demos

2023-03-15 09:42:24,Will also request other experts hiding in the weeds to lend their expertise around StableDiffusion: [PHONE REMOVED] [PHONE REMOVED]
2023-03-15 09:59:32,Last paper I read on Deep Learning/NLP was Attention Is All You Need.
2023-03-15 10:07:03,I would highly recommend watching Karpathy's nonogpt video. 2 hours of golden content. He basically reproduces the same paper you read from scratch.
2023-03-15 10:07:15,[Beginner Researcher Answer]
2023-03-15 10:08:30,The other way is to work backwards from what is out there and we can study e.g. everything from Llama to Flan-T5 and see what blocks they've been built on
2023-03-15 10:10:15,Do you think Xavi Amatriain's catalog is a good read for starters?
2023-03-15 10:12:00,"That can be a bit overwhelming for someone who was last reading BERT-era papers. I mean, even Contrastive Learning is a new concept there in a way. "

2023-03-15 10:17:11,Re-iterating: Non-technical Qs most welcome. They also are good prompt for someone to elaborate and spark and idea :)
2023-03-15 10:28:48,transformers have taken over the field which was dominated primarily by RNN variants. Are we seeing signals of any new architecture doing the same with transformers?

2023-03-15 10:42:28,What do you think about trlx re: PPO? 
2023-03-15 10:51:41,"My very spicy, uninformed take is that we'll see model sizes, personalities, flavours spread across the spectrum of use cases like we did for DBs."
2023-03-15 10:53:19,"Do we think finetuning is needed for most of the usecases? Or just clever prompt engineering is the way to go? The way I am thinking about this is finetuned model is someone who has learned and internalised the concepts vs prompt optimisation with relevant context is someone intelligent reading interesting information and inferring outputs based on it? And for most cases I feel someone smart reading correct information and responding based on that would be sufficient. Do we think that for applications, prefix / prompt tuning is the way to go than finetuning base models (for applications; for open source LLMs, we will need instruction tuning) ?"
2023-03-15 10:53:19,"For artists (non-tech) looking for _prompt to art_ experiments, what is the next step after playing with basic prompts on Midjourney & Dall-e? Do you recommend just going deep with those two platforms, or is there something else that works better?"
2023-03-15 10:53:20,Alex from Carper AI is presenting this tonight at W&B conference. So I'll wait till then and discuss tomorrow.
2023-03-15 10:54:40,Playgroundai
2023-03-15 10:55:27,Prompt optimisation looks more lucrative as the possible size of prompt is now much bigger. Would we train smaller models which will generate better prompts for the underlying LLMs ?
2023-03-15 10:56:33,"Stable Diffusion gives you a lot more control, power and flexibility. See civitai.com (NSFW!) for all the styles and themes you can create around. You might also want to checkout a couple of Youtube artists using this really well for prompt to art: youtube.com/@sebastiankamph is my fav at the moment"

2023-03-15 13:14:51,"Most research shows that bigger the model, more the number of emergent properties. Are there any works that show when these arise during training? Do they arise gradually one by one as we train or do they all come up early and become better as we train?"

2023-03-17 10:40:01,Training involves curating a dataset which is a lot of effort. The dataset they used to train on was curated till 2021.
2023-03-17 10:40:33,"Cleaning the data, wrangling it etc take a LOT of time"

2023-03-20 17:44:19,Hey Kishore!
2023-03-20 17:44:33,Excited to see what you have so far.
2023-03-20 17:51:48,Hi Kishore! Welcome to the group. Curious about the images you posted. Are they examples of what a static image is or output from your product's pipeline?
2023-03-20 17:53:37,Hi [PHONE REMOVED] . This is the output from my product pipeline.
2023-03-20 17:54:35,Pretty cool! So stable diffusion with some fine tuning magic I would guess?
2023-03-20 17:55:02,"hey, nice to see you here [PHONE REMOVED], amazing progress from last time we caught up 👍"
2023-03-20 18:00:26,You can do this without finetuning. There are many methods out there which you can implement to get similar results. But it does require a lot of trial and error and breaking apart the typical model. You can change the encoders. and other things in the HF pipeline for it to work.

2023-03-21 07:06:25,"For folks working on multiple images with minor variations, here is a _tutorial_ (yes! we're in the tutorial era of Stable Diffusion) using ComfyUI for generating similar images but with models of different ethnicities and different anime styles of same character"
2023-03-21 09:05:31,Hi [PHONE REMOVED] the main product here doesn’t vary. The main product isn’t the candle. It is the matchstick box with the person holding it.
2023-03-21 09:08:40,This image should be a better representation [PHONE REMOVED]
2023-03-21 09:13:26,Is that how tools like flair / booth.ai work?
2023-03-21 10:01:58,How do they retain the text? Lora screws it up usually right
2023-03-21 10:29:58,Didn't try it. Will give it a shot
2023-03-21 10:42:13,I think there's some smart img2img + masking going on apart from dreamboothing
2023-03-21 11:05:11,https://bit.ly/hf-nvidia-meetup
2023-03-21 11:08:00,"Flair isn't using dreambooth. They are using their own custom trained models, which to my understanding was some sort of mask based, with outpainting. The issues with dreambooth are not only text but also product fidelity. You cannot get the original product fidelity preserved with dreambooth. Also dreambooth required people to custom train models which was very inefficient. better methods have popped up after that. ControlNet, Adapters, Composer(pending release).  finetuning models to my understanding is not needed as of now. You can control, style, image composition, colour scheme without finetuning a model for usecases similar to flair."
2023-03-21 11:32:37,[PHONE REMOVED] I missed this. Primarily speaking training a model on an object and trying to recreate it during the generation process fails when the product fidelity cannot be compromised. The only method which exists as of today is to start the init image of the pipelines and then create the rest of the image. Even when you do that you can see that the product will get changed because all the SD algorithms work in latent space and not in pixels space. This compression and reconstruction of the image makes it impossible to get the original product image which is present in init image. however the solution is very straightforward . All you need to do is copy paste the pixels on the final image where the product exists. No need for LORA or anything of that sort. 
2023-03-21 11:32:50,Is anywhere working on apps like these : https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35236275
2023-03-21 11:35:06,Worked on document search.
2023-03-21 11:39:42,"Thanks for explaining! I was thinking about this problem statement the other day. What if we take a pic of the product photo in the exact orientation we want, remove the background and inpaint a new one around the product? Haven't tried out Booth ai myself though"
2023-03-21 11:40:08,They are using LLM + embedding approach. Guess they use LangChain as well under the hood.
2023-03-21 11:44:52,Yes this is exactly what I was talking about
2023-03-21 11:46:45,And that's why you will have these differences. This will work for e-commerce folks at all. Especially for high value items like furniture
2023-03-21 11:47:36,it will or won't? My understanding is that it won't work.
2023-03-21 11:48:10,"It definitely WON'T work! Sorry, did a typo in the worst possible place 😅"
2023-03-21 11:52:48,But here's a method that I am reasonably confident WILL work - Users can use a Nerf capture app like Luma to generate a 3D model from any novel viewpoint. It's as easy as walking around a product while taking a video and takes like 30s. Perhaps extract a mesh from the capture because that's easier to render in a browser than Nerf. Then in your product let the user rotate and orient the accurately captured product however they want. Take a snapshot of it without background. Then mask and inpaint like you did.
2023-03-21 11:56:10,This will remove all limitations. Highly accurate and infinite product photo generation from any angle in every aspect ratio for all your visualization needs.
2023-03-21 11:56:23,[PHONE REMOVED] isnt simple bg subtraction and some bg improvement good enough for ecommerce? :thi
2023-03-21 11:56:49,[PHONE REMOVED] s images also seemed mostly really smart bg replacement only.
2023-03-21 11:56:57,"[PHONE REMOVED] you can read up on this as well. https://www.deepset.ai/blog/build-a-search-engine-with-gpt-3 This is by deepset and they have a framework called Haystack. I was looking into it in June of last year, and it's pretty good. Suggest you check it out as well."
2023-03-21 11:57:02,There is a slight halo that is visible if you stare at it long enough 😅
2023-03-21 11:57:19,"Yes, because that is what it is. It is BG replacement."
2023-03-21 11:57:46,I was using similar method too for characters in a scene but this halo hurt the continuity. I am moving to using controlnet for this.
2023-03-21 11:57:55,A lot frankly. But that was mainly cause the original lighting of the image had it and I didn't wan't to spend time to remove it.
2023-03-21 11:58:14,I am using controlnet
2023-03-21 11:58:20,The images are from using controlnet
2023-03-21 11:58:23,Yea. Lighting causes it. Magic brushing with smudge over it removes it usually.
2023-03-21 11:58:32,Ah really. 🤔
2023-03-21 11:58:53,Maybe mine have a halo too. lemme check 😅
2023-03-21 11:59:20,Yes that's the ideal case if you already have the product photo in the exact orientation you want. Real world situation is that product photography is a whole other expensive initiative usually done by a different team. Marketing which creates the final images comes in much later and they have to make do with what they already have. Like there's a whole workflow for this thing.
2023-03-21 11:59:46,^Yea. I was asked to once build a 3D rotating platform to take ecommerce photos :P
2023-03-21 11:59:58,"For constant lighting, bg etc."
2023-03-21 12:00:23,So if you have a 3D capture that the marketing team can put into ANY orientation to generate images that's a big advantage.
2023-03-21 12:00:49,"3D is hard for a lot of use-cases like clothes, grocery no?"
2023-03-21 12:01:14,Your eyes will fall out if I show you Nerf captures of clothes and grocery
2023-03-21 12:02:25,"Hahaha. I have not done nerf but in my freelancing days, number of folks who reached out to me for 3d capture of clothes expecting realistic results was 🙏"
2023-03-21 12:03:00,"And then folks also wanted these clothes to go over humans and look ""natural"""
2023-03-21 12:03:48,"I might even have a long mail explaining ""Cloth Simulation is not a solve problem"". Definitely not in freelancing monies :P"

2023-03-22 15:44:00,send results?
2023-03-22 17:31:33,folks noob question but has openAI exposed multimodal inputs to GPT4? I see that I can only feed chatGPT plus text.
2023-03-22 17:44:59,not yet. very few have access to visual input right now.
2023-03-22 17:45:28,ah understood thanks!
2023-03-22 18:31:45,anyone working in any projects related to healthcare?
2023-03-22 18:49:16,Yes
2023-03-22 19:06:59,Do tell.
2023-03-23 13:20:21,Patiently waiting for them to let everyone use it 😂

2023-03-23 13:50:15,Hoping to get a contract with the gates foundation to build a Whatsapp chatbot to guide rural nurses in India. 
2023-03-23 13:58:10,Rural india would need Hindi
2023-03-23 13:58:32,"Hindi is supported by both GPT4 and Whisper, so quite doable"
2023-03-23 13:58:51,Most popular Indian vernacular languages are in fact
2023-03-23 13:59:15,We’re also using bhashini - an indian government funded research project that has a fine tuned whisper model for hindi
2023-03-23 13:59:22,The hindi results of gpt are not as great as english
2023-03-23 13:59:39,Slightly confused then by Bill Gates writing about an Indian startup working on LLMs for Indian languages
2023-03-23 13:59:49,This is probably why
2023-03-23 14:00:28,"Yes, same findings. Plus the source documents are all in English too. Using google translate so that gpt only ever sees english"
2023-03-23 14:01:20,Hmm. Doesn't look like it with GPT4 — original ChatGPT was worse. Using Google Translate would invariably add error. Propose a test set on this — why discuss opinions when we can run experiments!

2023-03-24 21:59:56,Do you interact with GPT in English or directly in vernacular languages?
2023-03-24 22:18:32,Direct vernacular is supported
2023-03-24 23:49:56,Doesnt have very good performance though
2023-03-25 00:09:35,Can try few shot learning for training
2023-03-25 00:45:19,I ran out of context length before I could stuff enough context for it to have significant improvements 😂
2023-03-25 18:57:01,What was your workflow? Like what tools did u use?
2023-03-25 19:14:48,Completely using Stable Diffusion. Workflow was first using text2img with controlnet depth map of this image. I got the depth map from Clipdrop's API because it's really good. Thanks to Sudharshan's tweet for this tip! Fixed the red background using this. 
2023-03-25 19:15:29,Do you use automatic1111 for all this? Or just code
2023-03-25 19:16:14,Automatic1111. You would go mad doing this with code 😅
2023-03-25 19:18:59,Makes sense. Have you played around with langchain agents / chatgpt plugins? 
2023-03-25 19:28:44,I think certain things are easier and more fun with a UI - when you need more control and direction a UI would do
2023-03-25 19:29:02,Neat! The depth maps have more control
2023-03-25 19:29:21,"The only problem with this is that you need to run iteration loops in every step until you are satisfied with the output before moving to the next step. Doing 1, 2, 3 successively would not work."
2023-03-25 19:30:13,And this is nothing new for artists: retakes are common
2023-03-25 19:35:57,"Personally what fascinates me more about AI generating art than generating code is how a deterministic input (auto encoder, model weights, controlnet algorithms etc) can give infinite non deterministic output."
2023-03-25 19:37:10,"I believe the non deterministic output still stems from a classical random number generator :) if you keep the seed constant, its very much deterministic."
2023-03-25 19:38:05,Yep
2023-03-25 19:38:27,"Simple but quite useful, the entire concept of seeds"
2023-03-25 19:38:44,To someone who has control over enough constraints the entire universe becomes deterministic

It is even able to create even Homography matrix if I say move left by 20% etc (Homography Matrix tells how to transform an image by translation, scaling eyc).

2023-03-27 17:54:31,Asked GPT-4 (via ChatGPT Plus) the following puzzle for and it fumbled and failed.
2023-03-27 17:55:28,As per the paper they can't do well. See Aravind's post about contamination: https://aisnakeoil.substack.com/p/gpt-4-and-professional-benchmarks
2023-03-27 17:55:35,Is it 20kg of supplies all together or each person? Can the supplies be broken?

2023-03-27 18:17:09,"Yeah, not 100% sure of this. There are just so many questions out there, that these newly created questions could just rewording without change in core idea. See Aravind's blog. In my experience with ChatGPT, when I give problems that are easy to medium and then I change the problem ever so slightly in its core idea and it will get it wrong. Or there are tell tale signs it has mugged up. Like I will give a problem that is a coin change in disguise with coins that are multiples of each other.  Thus allows greedy solution, it will provide a DP Solution (I am not even testing for corner cases etc or even if it will run). Just whether the core structure is right, which it did not. So in my experience small perturbations to core idea causes drastic change in correctness."
2023-03-27 18:18:16,Hard questions usually are what differentiates for top ranks (and much fewer) and could just be what people put more effort in creating.
2023-03-27 18:58:04,I saw someone on Twitter saying gpt-4 does much worse than leetcode hard on newer Euler problems.

And working on something using LLMs. Funny thing is the same time, question I asked it is the exact kind of question I would usually ask a fresher to know if they are faking it (as in just knowing the answers mugging up a lot of leetcode answers) or they conceptually know it. I do think lot of the code today we write, will easily to automated too. That begs the question what won't be. All the glue code, all the templates, all the code that is quickly needed to get a project up and running will all be automated. What will possibly remain? So what skills will become more important?"

2023-03-29 22:53:50,And it was a packed house.
2023-03-29 22:54:19,I use a score in interactive sessions. So penalize when it starts to hallucinate. That seems to help. But not in first time prompting. Similarly score for speed seems to help  🤫

2023-03-29 22:58:02,But we can verify if the source is legit or not ? Or does it cite something that might be obscure ?
2023-03-29 22:58:32,And yeah very good one at that. I had it create references with actual researcher in that area of maths. Just that they didn't write the paper (at least not yet or don't know if it had access to data I don't have access to ;)
2023-03-29 22:59:19,Are you using penalty system like the Dan jailbreak? 
2023-03-29 22:59:25,"Depends on the task — for open domain QA, it'll make up very believable stuff and you'll be tripping acid for a while. For closed domain QA, verification is somewhat easier but harder to use this signal."

2023-03-29 23:05:02,"What surprised me was that the speed one worked. Can others try and let me know if it works for you too. Nothing Fancy: start with saying you get +1 for producing the output fast and -1 for slow responses. But ensure that you doing when things are bit slow. Last 3-4 days, it adds a disclaimer that it will be slow irrespective but in my experience it was decently fast compared to otherwise."
2023-03-29 23:06:27,"Because if this works, seems like they might be throttling using prompts!! Which just didn't seem right."
2023-03-29 23:11:37,I was thinking of doing something else. Basically you can make a series of questions answer pairs based on the output it gave and then search using serp or other available tools to validate or invalidate the answer. Haven’t tried this out but will do so when I get the time.
2023-03-29 23:12:11,second one does seem to work. will share here if I find any really good solution. was thinking if a custom agent implementation helps which first figures out if this is made up (does induce recursive problem) and then dodges the reply if yes.

2023-03-30 15:47:37,Same pinch. 
2023-03-30 15:48:30,and likewise infra spend has also increased dramatically
2023-03-30 15:51:00,Coded a sparse autoencoder in MATLAB back in 2012. Not ashamed to admit that was the peak of my ML prowess
2023-03-30 15:53:40,I actually first heard about ML first from [PHONE REMOVED] nerding about Tom Mitchell's book
2023-03-30 15:57:11,I think I still have a pdf of it somewhere. The only major book I got a hard copy of was the AI AMA.
2023-03-30 15:57:58,Curious to know if there are folks from the mlblr / tsai community here!
2023-03-30 15:59:33,I mucked around with theano and also had a gsoc proposal that didn't go through 😅

2023-03-31 11:25:03,"Hi all,"
2023-03-31 11:26:01,Hi Pradyumna. You can just use the Whisper API to get the transcript. Don't need GPUs
2023-03-31 11:26:07,"You can upload this to gooey doc search too, might take a while. You can select the asr model in settings"
2023-03-31 11:27:18,You can use Colab 
2023-03-31 11:27:49,"Thanks alot, trying this right now"
2023-03-31 11:28:15,"Oh you just needed the transcript. Sorry, that’s at https://gooey.ai/asr/"
2023-03-31 11:29:04,"Oh, thanks! "
2023-03-31 11:29:20,Sure
2023-03-31 11:31:02,"You could even use - https://www.gladia.io/ - 1-hour audio file transcript will be extracted in 10-20 seconds which uses openai Whisper backend. Currently, the API is free."
2023-03-31 11:54:41,"Maybe check out Assembly.ai, they have a playground to upload files to and try transcription, accuracy is pretty good too."
2023-03-31 11:56:59,Checking. I usually use their python API.
2023-03-31 11:58:01,[PHONE REMOVED] I tried just now with a 50-minute audio file by uploading. It worked fine.
2023-03-31 11:58:25,"Wierd, I'll try again. Thanks"
2023-03-31 12:46:26,Tried on one of the medium blogs and it’s pretty good. Is there a constraint on time limit on the video generated?
2023-03-31 12:51:22,seems like the default is 1 minute
2023-03-31 13:03:08,yes we are generating videos for around 1 minute. There is a limit on size of blog - upto 20k characters
2023-03-31 13:03:27,Is the 1 minute limit because of computation/cost or technical limitations?
2023-03-31 13:03:32,let me check
2023-03-31 13:04:15,"just a product decision for now, since it's free for now - cost is also a reason"
2023-03-31 13:04:39,What'd it take to make a Tiktok/IG reels version of this?
2023-03-31 13:07:23,Or use whisper.cpp
2023-03-31 13:08:38,You mean in terms of only the resolution or is there any other difference
2023-03-31 13:08:57,"Pitch, editing style, cuts, screen transitions, overlays"
2023-03-31 13:09:16,"yes all of that is what i am working on, that is the plan"
2023-03-31 13:10:14,"i mean there are lower hanging fruits then these , but all of these will come.  Making pitch better will happen sooner"

2023-04-02 20:08:25,"I don't have a brief doc written but based on my experience, LoRA works really well compared to other two especially after being trained on small amount of data relatively, followed by dreambooth which would provide decent results after multiple attempts of fine tuning whereas textual inversion did'nt return any good results for me, i did try making small changes but that didn't help much as well."

2023-04-03 02:00:33,"> But it’s very possible that creativity and what we think of us as human intelligence are just an emergent property of a small number of algorithms operating with a lot of compute power (In fact, many respected neocortex researchers believe there is effectively one algorithm for all intelligence.  I distinctly remember my undergrad advisor saying the reason he was excited about machine intelligence again was that brain research made it seem possible there was only one algorithm computer scientists had to figure out.)"
2023-04-03 02:02:04,"> Human brains don’t look all that different from chimp brains, and yet somehow produce wildly different capabilities.  We decry current machine intelligence as cheap tricks, but perhaps our own intelligence is just the emergent combination of a bunch of cheap tricks."

2023-04-05 00:57:27,"One naive approach is if you have graph structure with sentences as nodes, you can use openai embeddings - ""text-embedding-ada-002"" to get node embeddings directly, and using adjacency matric you can compute edge embeddings by averaging the connected nodes."

2023-04-05 18:35:56,yes / can get very expensive very quickly. 5K questions a day.
2023-04-05 18:38:49,Can it be done by similarity search ? 
2023-04-05 18:38:57,You can perhaps then use gpt4 data do generate your own dataset
2023-04-05 18:39:11,And then train a model of your own labelled dataset
2023-04-05 18:39:19,And use that in prod

I know that in chatGPT and GPT 3, 3.5, asking it to simulate another agent with different ideals works well. I don't have access to GPT 4 but have heard that this doesn't work well with it. What, in particular, are you interested about in prompt injections?"

Atleast with the experiments I did, I had no luck to get promo injection working with GPT-4. OpenAI seems to have worked well on handling it."
2023-04-06 00:09:33,"I reckon they made good use of the system prompt this time. My guess is that it’s appended at the END of all previous messages and the network is trained to ignore the grammatical content of it, but obey the instructions."

2023-04-06 15:36:58,"Sure, so hybrid meaning searching for keywords + semantic meaning. My understanding is that you can use sparse + dense embeddings to achieve better accuracy on results. Pinecone for example allows you to store both of these for a single ID. Wondering if Chroma does the same"
2023-04-06 15:38:24,"Yes, Chroma does the same. They don't have good docs around it yet though. Assuming that you're a hacker solving for time to market, launch with Pinecone. Move to Chroma when someone asks on-premise"
2023-04-06 15:40:01,Combined system definitely will perform better and I feel we are on the verge of achieving this in AI. But as of now it’s clear that memory is a limiting factor of LLMs and hence we need alternative solutions.

2023-04-06 15:47:56,"Some sort of a entity relationship graph might work, upon some text input, we could semantically traverse the graph to filter out the relevant nodes and edges and focus on them for future processing (using LLMs maybe)"
2023-04-06 15:49:44,Even I’m not sure if it will work but I definitely feel there are some semantic gaps when using purely embeddings and this might be a solution
2023-04-06 15:51:36,The thing is: *everything* can be (and is) linearly embeddable. Even graphs themselves 😀.
2023-04-06 15:52:25,"Understood, yea the graph db approach makes a lot of sense"
2023-04-06 15:52:45,I'm actually designing something like the second for a company right now
2023-04-06 15:55:30,Nice nice thanks will check it out 🙏🏽
2023-04-06 15:57:31,I wonder how many of their new integrations are going to be business-motivated (eg: the bm25 being with Elastic). I'm guessing we can still contribute our own adaptors for other platforms to their GitHub..
2023-04-06 15:57:51,"Nope, used an in memory JSON file with embeddings stored in a key value store. For the hack it was good enough, but for scaling it I was planning to use weaviate. "
2023-04-06 16:06:53,"b25 is more fundamental I think… it’s a class in lucene, on top of which Elastic is essentially built."
2023-04-06 16:10:03,"By “bootstrapped” I mean those who have their own “search-system”, and do not use Elastic, etc."
2023-04-06 16:27:40,"btw, langchain has some stuff around graphs as well "
2023-04-06 16:29:40,"for anyone using pinecone, just be careful. their pricing is very confusing. this dude paid $1000 for ... ~no usage"
2023-04-06 16:35:21,yeahs got $24 billing for 5 days with just 10 queries -
2023-04-06 16:36:37,For how many indexes?
2023-04-06 16:38:04,2
2023-04-06 16:39:40,damn. could've had one month of ChatGPT Pro and still have $4 left 😂
2023-04-06 16:40:26,Then it should be correct I guess. One index costs approx $2.3 per day and 2 indexes for 5 days it’s $24
2023-04-06 16:41:30,Was the bill because he was creating an index per customer or something?
2023-04-06 17:11:33,"only after his tweet I deleted my unused stuff on Pinecone, did not know I was paying for it."
2023-04-06 17:25:55,"i checked my account as well, just in case"
2023-04-06 17:26:32,Digital ocean used to be the nice ones 🥲
2023-04-06 17:27:27,thats why i use credit card with limits. so if by any chance any tools more than what I can pay. Service stops.
2023-04-06 17:28:37,"pinecone started off with a lot of community collaboration, their blogs on semantic search by james briggs are still my favorite on the topic"
2023-04-06 17:34:36,"this was generated by chatgpt, right?"
2023-04-06 17:35:01,"lol, no"

2023-04-06 17:42:19,anyone here tried the gpt4 compression prompt? it's pretty good. 
2023-04-06 17:43:51,"I tried out another one I saw before this tweet, worked good for plain text, not much for other kinds of text(like code)"
2023-04-06 18:17:27,Read somewhere Djikstra loved theoritical CS so much that he considered plebs writing code to paint pixels on a screen vulgar in his time.
2023-04-06 18:24:27,yeah. i tried to compress lyrics. didn't work.

2023-04-06 20:50:55,"Speaking of which, Chroma just announced their template for Replit."
2023-04-06 21:07:06,Terabyte or Teraflop?
2023-04-06 21:19:26,"Haha.. Let me bite. I wouldn't bet against theory folks (CS Theory) in the long term. First aeroplanes were build out of experiments but we really learned how to build aircrafts safely only later with the necessary math. They will come up with much simpler representation and more compact algorithm. That is their job by definition. To quote a friend who was an early FB engineer, what we write becomes useless in few months. Some of what they do remains current for much much longer. That's probably where he is coming from."
2023-04-06 21:34:13,What is your take?
2023-04-06 21:43:07,Lol!
2023-04-06 21:45:16,ig some people are so attached to the work of their lifetime that they cannot accept/focus on things changing…

2023-04-06 22:14:54,I spoke too soon. There is a hot new YC company on this: https://getmetal.io/
2023-04-06 22:15:22,OpenAI notebook bug fixes + Stripe → YC pipeline is strong 💪
2023-04-06 22:16:47,How Stripe?
2023-04-06 22:17:18,That is how you take the credit card of an unsuspecting developer and then invoice them some absurd amount 😛
2023-04-06 22:40:42,Paul Krugman is another one 😂
2023-04-06 22:53:15,Has anyone tried using ElevenLabs for training and generating audio in Hindi?

2023-04-07 00:16:12,He opted out because his demo used some real-world company designs and data.
2023-04-07 00:17:57,"For those who track of hackathon demos in SF/NYC/Berlin circuits, I genuinely believe that all winners would've done well in SF, won in NYC/Berlin in Feb end atleast. Would love to hear more if you do track :)"

2023-04-07 13:09:41,Pichai baba is back baby!
2023-04-07 13:10:58,Gazab
2023-04-07 13:14:09,I’m curious that for use cases outside of those that need extreme security - why would I run a model on my personal machine vs accessing it via an API?
2023-04-07 13:15:42,"It's wayyy lower latency, higher throughput. Think why games continue to be written for devices."
2023-04-07 13:15:55,Also Makes compute significantly cheaper for companies serving consumers at scale
2023-04-07 13:16:15,This would still happen on a server farm I assume?
2023-04-07 13:16:18,"brb, gotta buy some Cloudflare now."
2023-04-07 13:16:33,Doesn’t the inference take longer though?
2023-04-07 13:17:05,"No, WASM will do the rest. Segment-Anything proves that inference can be light-weight decoder only"
2023-04-07 13:17:09,"Depends on the case I guess, I know some very large companies who have benefitted significantly from running ML on the mobile edge"
2023-04-07 13:17:14,Thought that is more a bandwidth issue. How much data can I fit through a pipe
2023-04-07 13:17:20,I literally opened vested for this
2023-04-07 13:17:21,:P
2023-04-07 13:17:56,Cashflow poor and idea rich people think alike 😛
2023-04-07 13:18:20,Any examples?

2023-04-07 13:26:01,hopefully battery tech keeps up
2023-04-07 13:26:57,like Google Keyboard already does
2023-04-07 13:30:31,I think the best product in this case is actually SwiftKey and Microsoft acquired them very quietly in 2016
2023-04-07 13:31:25,"As we move to models running on the edge, I'd not be surprised to see Microsoft launching some OAI features inside SwiftKey"
2023-04-07 13:31:34,The product as is works incredibly well
2023-04-07 13:54:48,SwiftKey has been botched after the acquisition. It's a slow and unbearable app now
2023-04-07 14:05:20,How is agent planning evolving? This was quite broken in Turbo. Is it 2x better in GPT4? 10x better? 
2023-04-07 14:06:23,"No idea, deep diving soon"
2023-04-07 14:15:54,"Umm, not sure why you'd say so - have been using it since they were launched and haven't seen any notable difference"

2023-04-07 14:31:34,This is probably just me but I still don’t have a good sense of why something like pgVector won’t work. At what scale does pgVector not work?
2023-04-07 14:37:49,Does pg_vector also do NN like HNSW or nmslib?
2023-04-07 14:38:11,"I'll RTFM, but if someone has direct docs, would appreciate"
2023-04-07 14:47:31,It is not performance as in speed but accuracy/semantic richness. Does this answer your question.
2023-04-07 14:53:41,"Don't think so, quick glance through code base doesn't seem like it."
2023-04-07 14:58:55,there was some good discussion wrt pgvector in this thread https://twitter.com/jobergum/status/1643187540222959616
2023-04-07 15:02:45,"btw, has anyone tried out Midjourney's /describe feature (img2text2img)? "
2023-04-07 15:04:33,Interesting read on hardware infra of OpenAI
2023-04-07 15:59:40,"I spoke to Qdrant founder, and he said pgvector is basically unusable for LLM apps. It has recall in the area of 50%"
2023-04-07 16:20:14,Basically whatever was referenced here
2023-04-07 16:24:23,"Erik Bern of Modal Labs maintains ann-benchmarks github.com/erikbern/ann-benchmarks, let's request him to add pg_vector to it?"
2023-04-07 16:25:03,"This is something we can test/verify empirically, don't need to trust opinions from direct competition"
2023-04-07 16:39:44,And avatars come for news anchors: https://twitter.com/KhaleejMag/status/1641123893145485343
2023-04-07 16:43:33,True
2023-04-07 16:47:23,agreed. i find it kinda hard to trust benchmarking blogs by other vectorDB startups.

2023-04-07 18:31:58,The product? Confusing 🙈
2023-04-07 18:32:17,I'm not their Target either. I think they're building for PM junta
2023-04-07 18:36:32,"Haha, maybe they didn’t anticipate the launch of ChatGPT plugins"
2023-04-07 18:36:51,The last bad product I used was https://www.steamship.com
2023-04-07 18:37:14,Platform to deploy langchain applications
2023-04-07 18:39:03,Interviewing him this week for newsletter :)
2023-04-07 18:39:19,Why was this bad out of curiosity?
2023-04-07 18:40:42,Nice! What newsletter?
2023-04-07 18:42:13,ntkris.substack.com
2023-04-07 18:49:25,Sweeet! I might have a question.
2023-04-07 18:50:44,will ask!
2023-04-07 18:52:45,Keen to know too
2023-04-07 18:59:22,"Pinecone, weaviet, Chroma, vertex ai matching engine and there are bunch of other vector stores as well. What is the logic behind having soo many vector stores? Is the market soo huge?"
2023-04-07 18:59:40,They are building a wrapper on top of LangChain components to take it to production.
2023-04-07 19:02:06,"And I did mention it to one of their engineers on a call a month back, Harrison will pick up funding soon and have to build a cloud solution to monetize. "
2023-04-07 19:04:35,They raised $10 m
2023-04-07 19:05:36,"Question best answered by VCs [PHONE REMOVED], want to chip in?"
2023-04-07 19:07:35,[PHONE REMOVED]
2023-04-07 19:08:30,Sorry for the self plug but this is relevant to the conversation here: https://twitter.com/nirantk/status/1644290469915164672?s=46
2023-04-07 19:08:44,I love this quadrant
2023-04-07 19:09:11,"Honestly, based on Vespa founder's tweets I think they might have the best tech? But I die a slow death every time I look at their documentation"
2023-04-07 19:09:57,Oh long discussion but yeah pinecone is basically far ahead of the competitors in terms of technology
2023-04-07 19:10:04,"Vespa is so good, and their docs so bad -- you could make money by just simplifying their docs."
2023-04-07 19:12:13,"Why/how are they ahead? Latency, throughput?"
2023-04-07 19:12:35,Gcp vertex ai matching engine is ready for enterprise scale? 
2023-04-07 19:13:19,"My biggest worry with vector stores: what happens when Azure, AWS or GCP adds them?"
2023-04-07 19:14:46,"The same thing which happened with Mongo, Elastic, MySQL, Postgres"
2023-04-07 19:25:43,"Basically pinecone has been in the bake for 4 years, always focusing on enterprise readiness and supports the largest number of use cases. Happy to talk more in depth about the actual tech that makes it more scalable, reliable"
2023-04-07 19:27:49,"Generally agree. My one push back on this: all of the things you mention are the “primary” storage of some kind. Vector DBs, for now, are a critical feature. I still need a stand-alone sql or no sql db for the rest of my stack"
2023-04-07 19:30:14,"True. And unless it's massive scale, where the differences in performance becomes signficant, there's probably merit to keeping it unified"
2023-04-07 19:30:29,Does pinecone offer a signficant advantage over something like pgvector?
2023-04-07 20:26:59,inb4 AWS comes out with an S3 integration for vector DB storage
2023-04-07 21:36:45,This would be a game changer.

2023-04-07 22:57:13,"Haha, nice idea, and then scrape the learning articles and links and make sumarizer, which summarizes every topic in 10 words 😎"
2023-04-08 00:30:05,So needed
2023-04-08 00:31:47,Do folks know if anyone has integrated chatGPT/LLMs into Alexa/Nest type of smart home devices? Seems like a low hanging fruit.
2023-04-08 00:35:58,"hey folks, has anyone dabbled with paddlespeech?"
2023-04-08 11:56:56,The video of the talk by Anil Ananthaswamy on ChatGPT held at BIC is published - https://youtu.be/WF28ZwhUCc4
2023-04-08 14:00:54,"there are tools that do it, alexa and siri integration is possible given you have your openai key which is the barrier to adoption"
2023-04-08 15:50:07,Use Automatic 1111 on colab
2023-04-08 15:50:46,If you have MacBook download DrawThings App.
2023-04-08 15:51:52,GPU memory issue i think. Try smaller models
2023-04-08 15:52:08,I believe Jay is trying to get that running on local via Web GPU. Not a direct Python to GPU.
2023-04-08 15:56:01,I'm on windows machine on chrome canary. Currently the image is being created and is in process
2023-04-08 16:11:08,"Image got generated on windows, but took a lot of time"
2023-04-08 16:59:18,Automatic1111 works quite well on my max
2023-04-08 16:59:26,*Mac
2023-04-08 16:59:34,Like text to image in 10 seconds
2023-04-08 16:59:41,Is this even faster?
2023-04-08 17:01:45,SD is about 10 sec on A100 too
2023-04-08 17:03:36,Subtle flex but this one is M1Max with 64 gigs of RAM so maybe that's why
2023-04-08 17:03:49,It's ridiculous
2023-04-08 17:04:13,In my experience using Automatic on Mac simple text2image works but if you run inpainting with batch count of 4 using multi control net then you’re going to have trouble
2023-04-08 17:04:15,Meanwhile Siri is in absolute shambles
2023-04-08 17:04:46,This is with xformers and fp16 though
2023-04-08 17:05:02,Bro I already have trouble
2023-04-08 17:05:07,M2 with 16GB RAM though. Complex operations would be better with 64 GB
2023-04-08 17:13:28,Wealth advantage 😂
2023-04-08 17:14:51,"Given we are discussing apple hardware, I'm planning to buy a MacBook soon"
2023-04-08 17:16:01,2 points I have to decide on
2023-04-08 17:18:01,My recommendation would be to either go all the way or get the Macbook air
2023-04-08 17:18:50,You can always get generative AI running on a cloud setup

HackerDojo in Mountain View is a community run space, I think it is a not for profit, where people can get desks for cheap with bunch of tooling etc to build stuff. Couple of startups started there, Pinterest is one that comes to mind. They used to be the default place for many meetups. I had met H2O's Satish Ambati there, when they were just 2 people amongst others. There were quite few others.  There were a bunch of people from Google Brain and FB's some team, who used to give talks there. So there was the amazing vibe and back and forth between the grey hairs and people pushing the bleeding edge."

2023-04-09 18:07:30,Often compliance is a big reasion
2023-04-09 18:07:35,*reason
2023-04-09 18:10:37,"Yeah, I got the access. They are mostly vetting and rolling out access slowly. They have been following my work with Kissan GPT and provided support letter as I have been called up by ministries. That may be the reason for my boost."

2023-04-09 18:36:06,You guys may be right about country preferences due to compliance as I got access to GPT4 API in the first few days only. The another reason can be age of account or usage. I have been using their API platform since 2020.

2023-04-10 09:01:35,"Weird, the political action project is the first thing we sold to a client back in 2022!  Who’s the creator?"

2023-04-10 09:33:50,"many of them are chatbots, we had so much variety in our hackathon imo."
2023-04-10 09:39:50,"GPT 3.5 users, have you ran into problems which require you to limit output length?"
2023-04-10 09:39:55,"So my question is, instead of instructing it to change its length in terms of characters, will there be any benefit to changing the length units to token. "
2023-04-10 09:39:57,Sorry for the long message. Had to make sure it's clear to the people who'd like to answer
2023-04-10 09:41:33,The recommended way to do this is to use Guardrails and turn on re-ask (iterative variant of your recursive strategy). It's easier to reason about and often more token efficient too. 
2023-04-10 09:42:00,You'd know about this if you were at the hackathon venue [PHONE REMOVED] — we had Guardrails creator do the demo xD
2023-04-10 09:42:27,"Thanks a lot, will check it out"

2023-04-10 10:00:14,My intent for sharing this is to emphasise that Indians are no longer playing catch up. 
2023-04-10 10:03:45,One weird thing that I noticed in guardrails and kor - why is the schema format not the same as the output format?
2023-04-10 10:05:39,What’s Kor?
2023-04-10 10:05:58,General purpose parser for any text/schema
2023-04-10 10:06:06,"Similarly for guardrails, the schema is xml, but the output is json"
2023-04-10 10:08:20,"From a language/lib design PoV, these are the two things you're trying to balance: "
2023-04-10 10:10:08,<3
2023-04-10 10:10:58,"The dsl makes sense, but the part that’s confusing to me is why the schema sent to the llm is not the same as the requested output format."
2023-04-10 10:11:47,"My intuition, based on the thousands of samples I've tried so far is this. The resizing prompts work fairly well when input and output language is English. Tokenizing ka rule is uniform in English. "
2023-04-10 10:13:32,"Thanks for moving this back to main, since it's widely relevant. E.g. [PHONE REMOVED] has worked on an adjacent problem statement as well."
2023-04-10 10:14:13,Aligned on the non-English challenge: The BPE tokeniser is notoriously unstable for CJK and Indian languages. Better with European languages often. 
2023-04-10 10:15:11,"Prompt engineering in this way is a bit like casting a spell, and I don't think any amount of tips on ""wingardium leviosa"" is going to help — doing it will work best 🙌🏻"

2023-04-10 10:28:17,My customers are raising support tickets for this and saying that we're fooling them by saying we got GPT4 access
2023-04-10 10:29:29,"Ouch. I'd try to improve this with a system prompt: ""You are helpful OpenAI Assistant, specifically GPT4. Never say GPT3"" or something along those lines."
2023-04-10 10:31:25,"The reason this happens is that chat models are instruction finetuned, sanitised and scaled forks of large base models. Same for the REPL and Retrieval models in Plugins."
2023-04-10 10:34:15,This trick should also work the other way around. You can have GPT3.5-Turbo claim to be GPT4 😂

2023-04-10 21:49:37,Quick ques: What are the costs differences between GPT-4 and GPT3 API?
2023-04-10 21:51:39,"I had found this quick compare table,handy for comparing various models"
2023-04-10 22:12:56,any image-creation tool that accepts looking into a website design for reference?

2023-04-11 08:28:17,"I've seen this project/tool floated around Twitter. But I can't recall its name, google isn't helping much either. Would love if anyone of you can share what its called or a link to it."
2023-04-11 08:29:30,That was a while back and I think they were using flat GPT output without crawling their pages. I may be wrong.
2023-04-11 08:45:14,is it this one? : https://wtfdoesthiscompanydo.vercel.app/
2023-04-11 08:45:53,Yeah
2023-04-11 08:48:19,thanks folks
2023-04-11 09:34:01,This is another interesting paper. Combined with Meta’s segmentation model can open up many interesting use cases. https://twitter.com/_akhaliq/status/1645594671068971008?s=46&t=HZS4Ar4p8RMA3Tj10LCWEw

2023-04-11 10:11:27,My hypothesis was they have profiles on pro open source people and are being slow w GPT-4 features w them

2023-04-11 10:43:11,"They ask you isn't it? Guessing probably use ur input + your ip + other sources like where cloudflare is serving from + some predictive stuff based on prior tokens. Guessing they probably use martech profile data as well. Which exact ones, is anyone guess. Guessing you tried messaging over Twitter. Try connects if you have any at OpenAI.

2023-04-11 16:28:57,[PHONE REMOVED] what kind of work do they do?
2023-04-11 16:34:52,The team works on content moderation and content quality on the Linkedin platform.
2023-04-11 16:35:46,So they build their own models or something for all these?
2023-04-11 16:37:07,"Yes, we train our own models, since the data distribution is different from the datasets used in academic setting."
2023-04-11 16:38:35,Yes got it!
2023-04-11 17:37:06,Anyone attending the OpenAI meetup in HSR today?

2023-04-11 21:45:23,Yes. It's possible. You can perform CRUD ops in database
2023-04-11 21:52:54,"this can be done using tools for dml,ddl commands or do you have any other method?"
2023-04-11 21:55:56,Yes. Just the dml commands. Connect with [PHONE REMOVED] if u are still blocked
2023-04-12 00:15:44,"Has anyone compared/experimented with OpenAI's best embedding model available ""text-embedding-ada-002"" vs Huggingface models or Sentence Transformers. Have seen most people using OpenAI's embedding, does it have any advantage over others available?"
2023-04-12 00:18:39,"I believe many of the OS ones are superior. There was a thread on this, let me see if I can find."

2023-04-12 00:45:25,"I had compared sentence transformers with OpenAI embeddings 6ish months ago..For my use case, sentence transformers turned out to be quite competitive"
2023-04-12 00:46:28,"Got it, thinking to try this model 'sentence-transformers/all-mpnet-base-v2', is that the best mpnet variation?"
2023-04-12 00:48:49,Multi-qa-mpnet-base-dot-v1 works a little bit better for semantic search ..but I will recommend tryiing top 2 or 3 and checking
2023-04-12 00:49:45,"Also if you need better scoring mechanisms, use cross-encoder for scoring afterwards"

2023-04-12 08:46:11,All the winners here have much higher _usability_ than what we had though
2023-04-12 08:46:14,Reminder: My intent for sharing this is to emphasise that Indians are no longer playing catch up. 
2023-04-12 09:02:05,"Thank you for sharing [PHONE REMOVED]. The chatrooms concept was super cool, brings social networking into it. I’m going to explore that. It is analogous to an idea I had about enabling long term conversational memory, by vector indexing the conversation history itself."
2023-04-12 09:04:20,Langchain has some pretty good abstractions around memory (in addition to the index+retrieve approach): https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/memory/examples/conversational_customization.html

2023-04-12 10:09:21,They're already doing that
2023-04-12 10:09:54,Yeah I heard in a Nadella interview.

2023-04-12 10:14:19,Are you referring to a foundational model or a GPT model fine tuned on India data?
2023-04-12 10:14:29,+100
2023-04-12 10:17:59,I would assume it would start off with GPT first.
2023-04-12 10:29:20,Problem is with all the examples you’ve mentioned we are not fully local till today 
2023-04-12 10:30:18,A better example would be India’s nuclear programme and ICBMs
2023-04-12 10:40:54,I think they'll create an LLM because Gov is more focused on self owned public infrastructure

2023-04-12 10:41:56,Lol what a coincidence
2023-04-12 10:42:33,But I think it will be very hard to beat translation + gpt-4 performance
2023-04-12 10:43:17,For now their focus can be on transliteration
2023-04-12 10:44:17,Also they might just invest 500 mil and ask Microsoft and Nvidia to just do it too who knows.

2023-04-12 10:52:18,More Indic languages will come :)
2023-04-12 10:52:29,We are using IndicTrans in KissanGPT for few already
2023-04-12 10:52:57,We use google translate. How are the latencies for indictrans? Where are you hosting it?
2023-04-12 10:53:04,Trying to add TTS but the inference is not optimized yet

2023-04-12 10:55:52,Our government is actually working to enable the ecosystem. They're hiring PMs for AI roles too. bhashini.gov.in/en/ecosystem
2023-04-12 10:55:58,"While [PHONE REMOVED] speaks of how the country is advancing and getting ahead in the tech-contribution at par with the westworld, the only difference is the tools that people build there start getting used quite immediately and you can see it’s effect, while it’d probably have 0 usability here."
2023-04-12 10:56:55,"Of course we are doing better than most, these models are good but our local open ecosystem needs to jump on making these models production ready from research output."
2023-04-12 10:57:18,That's probably because we don't have PMF with the end user. Our products are still not designed well for them
2023-04-12 10:57:46,By what time do you think farmers of India will start using https://kissangpt.com? 🙃
2023-04-12 10:58:01,I have been getting calls from all type of farmers and hobbyist about using Kissan GPT and feature requests. Not getting time to add features as I’m talking to them.
2023-04-12 10:58:28,Probably when it stops having foreign words like GPT in its name for starters
2023-04-12 10:58:44,(foreign to the local farmer)
2023-04-12 10:58:59,"that’s insane, kudos!"
2023-04-12 10:59:03,Already there is a good amount of folks using it. Farmers have phone and they are very much aware of news and things going on then you tokan think.
2023-04-12 10:59:12,Folks*
2023-04-12 10:59:37,There are large club house groups where talk regularly

2023-04-12 11:01:41,Do you have any systems in place ?
2023-04-12 11:01:48,"Yes, our students are capable but they don't have the required resources (computing is costly). Hopefully corporate and govt will support this ecosystem."
2023-04-12 11:02:17,No I don’t. But I’m collecting enough information that I can implement something in future and May be share voice dataset with Bhasini.
2023-04-12 11:02:57,"Let’s see, lot of initial conversation going on multiple front"
2023-04-12 11:03:52,I got one interesting request to integrate visual capabilities to detect bad signs in the crop photos. Do you have any plans or thoughts there?

2023-04-12 11:07:04,What will the cost to move it to the cloud?
2023-04-12 11:07:08,Need to keep cost low as possible to make it available for Agri domain
2023-04-12 11:07:50,Register a company and apply to Microsoft for startups get 150k in credits donot for 2 years
2023-04-12 11:07:54,One PSU already gave up
2023-04-12 11:08:06,"Same, we got google cloud for 2 years."
2023-04-12 11:08:10,Working on it
2023-04-12 11:08:25,Amazon before that. Just keep moving clouds until you get free credits from everyone
2023-04-12 11:08:28,They are supportive
2023-04-12 11:09:27,"With open source, non-profit research use cases any cloud provider can provide credits easily."
2023-04-12 11:10:10,How big are you guys? Just you?
2023-04-12 11:10:54,I am not thinking non-profit case as it won’t help me scale. I have Agri startups to integrate in their platforms lined up. But still they do give startup credits which I’m going to apply for.

2023-04-12 11:38:38,"What are you using, quality is good"
2023-04-12 11:54:12,"You have to literally hack into their XMLs and storage path to get those. They are saying they have them on Bhasini and open sourced them but I couldn’t find direct links. I tried to request on their account but I didn’t get any reply, and then the inference is not optimized. That’s the reason I’ve to run everything on my rigs right now, as a lot of hacks are involved."

2023-04-12 13:54:40,"Thanks, will try this"
2023-04-12 13:55:35,Dumb Q: Wont you use SAM to just generate a mask for the inpainting or outpainting model?
2023-04-12 13:57:36,I’m still a noob at these. 
2023-04-12 13:58:17,I think the advantage with SAM is the interactivity from a UX perspective
2023-04-12 13:58:33,"This looks like SD code, not the sam code"
2023-04-12 14:00:04,Yes SAM gives mask

2023-04-12 23:40:33,OpenAI have released open source implementation and model weights for their latest work. These models do one step image generation. 
2023-04-13 00:35:54,Love how they crowd sourced the dataset from own employees: https://www.databricks.com/blog/2023/04/12/dolly-first-open-commercially-viable-instruction-tuned-llm

2023-04-13 13:27:49,"Ditch em. That's a key risk. Even if you ever want to tell your customers how good your recall your QA is, Pinecone prevents you from doing so. Will handicap your marketing/sales."

2023-04-13 13:29:33,"Yeah, hear you on Weaviate's scaling issues. Qdrant scales betters. Connectors solution is to go via Llama Index for recall. "

2023-04-13 13:48:41,Which is the best Vector DB for production ?
2023-04-13 13:48:51,Naive question but being bold asked
2023-04-13 13:49:15,"Not naive at all, the answer is — we don't know"
2023-04-13 13:49:25,😎
2023-04-13 13:49:31,Ok
2023-04-13 13:49:37,"Worse, we don't know if it's worth answering this question when 32K context windows become a thing"
2023-04-13 13:50:03,I am a little biased but I'd throw in the name of Redis
2023-04-13 13:50:17,Inferencing costs?

2023-04-13 13:51:37,I am liking this group so lively
2023-04-13 13:52:41,There is one Vector DB Millivus
2023-04-13 13:52:43,"The current inferencing costs are about 10-50x from what they can be at scale, even for GPT4. I think the price will drop another 10x in next 6-12 months."

2023-04-13 13:54:58,I'll let you know how Pinecone goes. Will push to 250 customers next week.
2023-04-13 13:56:07,I’m implementing hybrid search and really annoyed with their docs. Literally tried their example and it doesn’t work. Good time to move away it sounds like
2023-04-13 13:56:19,"Umm, could I ask what makes you believe so? "
2023-04-13 13:56:39,Cloud Providers' APIs are also fairly expensive
2023-04-13 13:56:44,"Azure, AWS, GCP"
2023-04-13 13:58:32,"For example, https://aws.amazon.com/comprehend/medical/pricing/"
2023-04-13 13:58:48,GPT3.5 was cheaper than GPT3
2023-04-13 14:05:23,Was?
2023-04-13 14:05:57,text-davinci-003 is more expensive than gpt3.5-turbo
2023-04-13 14:06:11,"sorry, is."
2023-04-13 14:06:27,2M tokens for $2
2023-04-13 14:06:28,Ah! I thought they increased overnight
2023-04-13 14:07:06,point is that LLM models will only get cheaper and faster - as proven in the past few months. GPT4 is more expensive than 3.5 until GPT5 comes up
2023-04-13 14:07:32,GPT4 has two major releases pending: 
2023-04-13 14:08:06,3. Plugins for all practical purposes. I doubt they want to stop at giving 20K people access to that.
2023-04-13 14:08:56,Plugins has _at least_ 2 new GPT4 finetuned forks: 
2023-04-13 14:09:34,and plugins in API
2023-04-13 14:09:49,I got zero juice from that Atty OpenAI event
2023-04-13 14:09:53,sigh
2023-04-13 14:10:20,The juice from the Setu event was worth 30 min commute tbh
2023-04-13 14:10:43,Setu event?
2023-04-13 14:12:00,"Before the open-for-all event, Setu hosted Atty in a closed door meeting. He answered questions like finetuning for plugins, API design, release plans and constraints, internal tooling, some benchmarks (and who makes them), checkpointing and how they decide to brand one model as ""GPT4"""
2023-04-13 14:12:29,"bruh, this sounds so much better"
2023-04-13 14:12:45,lol
2023-04-13 14:13:02,"Can add libraries to the list? Faiss, Annoy, ScaNN, ANNlite"
2023-04-13 14:13:25,"Yeah, at the very least FAISS and Annoy qualify"
2023-04-13 14:13:34,But I ran out of storage in my Pokedex
2023-04-13 14:53:43,How much? :P
2023-04-13 14:58:11,If you've to ask ...
2023-04-13 14:59:46,"I doubt it Karthik, most of the foundational LLM companies are losing a lot of money + there is a GPU shortage in the market ... they have to jack up prices to customers.  At least I think next 12 months prices will increase, until there is mass adoption and so we reach supply demand equilibrium."
2023-04-13 15:01:32,Will you take a personal wager of 1L INR on price hike?
2023-04-13 15:01:57,I'm willing to take a personal wager that prices drop — either via people switching to internal GPUs or OpenAI or some other mechanism
2023-04-13 15:03:00,Sorry not a gambler here. But happy to buy you a drink. And as I said my comment is for commercial LLM providers - a company switching from commercial to self-hosted / open source LLM is not where my perspective applies.
2023-04-13 15:03:42,"Cost of compute is high, moving to open source / self hosted makes a lot of sense. But then you have to include the LLMOps cost + team cost + data cost etc etc ..."
2023-04-13 15:04:09,And I don't believe most startups have the money to hire very expensive research scientists that OpenAI has
2023-04-13 15:05:10,It is a gamble if you think it's a game of chance and not skill :)
2023-04-13 15:05:21,"Maybe once the usage of private data to train the model is restricted, APIs can be free if the user consent to give up on data rights. Paid for those who don't."
2023-04-13 15:05:26,The moat for a company lies in proprietary dataset is my view.
2023-04-13 15:10:22,"I believe even commercial ones will get cheaper and willing to bet on it. We haven’t even seen AWS, Google, Microsoft enter yet"
2023-04-13 15:14:55,Unfortunately to me it feels like Google is not even in the game. And Microsoft has such a sizeable investment in OpenAI that most probably Azure APIs will be essentially OpenAI APIs repackaged.
2023-04-13 15:15:25,I think the fight is between Oracle (yes lot of people don't know that they are cheapest out there in GPU pricing) vs. AWS
2023-04-13 15:16:23,TPUs don't make a difference?
2023-04-13 15:17:45,Fantastic case study from StableCog and what did they consider when selecting between all the popular Vector Databases.

2023-04-13 16:28:15,AFAIK: That is an open research problem.
2023-04-13 16:43:48,I'm currently in touch with the Lead who's managing vector similarity search in Redis
2023-04-13 16:44:57,"Recall against $$, recall against qps"
2023-04-13 17:21:09,"Prayank, I agree with your arguments from the economics pov. From a technical pov, it seems like models will get smaller without drastic reduction in accuracy unlike now. The fact that we can train them with simple optimisation algorithms, the fact that you train on 570GB to create a 170B parameter model etc, all sort of allude to the fact that we possibly have a much smaller model (possibly this is just a smaller model embedded in larger space, so to speak). There are things that can still  help these companies make money and we still have to use them."
2023-04-13 17:28:11,"The research community is super split on this. There is a smaller model future faction and a larger model faction. Smaller you described and larger you can guess. After having spoken to enough researchers, it feels like only time will tell which way we will head. OpenAI is clearly interested in larger and larger models."
2023-04-13 17:30:20,Is any meaningful alternative to Nvdia coming up in the next 12 months that can alleviate the stress on chip supply?
2023-04-13 17:31:11,"From what I have read, smaller models are accurate for certain tasks but for higher accuracy still larger models are required. And, also emergent abilities are coming out in larger models"

2023-04-13 17:40:50,"But the vibe at the bangalore meetup was very clear, they want to give the incumbents a run for their money :)"
2023-04-13 17:41:04,"You are 100% accurate on this. There is interesting dynamics around what is needed by the task at hand. So really the question is are there going to be lots of reasoning like applications or better search/similarity like applications. How much larger models resoning like capability requires, that probably is anyone guess. Given the semiconductor lifecycle, new chips will take time. OpenCL has been trying to make inroads for last decade. Would be interesting if new models can do reasoning (GPU like) + table lookups (traditional computers), AllenAI did some work on this but nothing mind blowing afaik."
2023-04-13 17:42:02,"IMO these are very long term play and probably only help OpenAI or whoever can afford development out side of cuda. Also OAI, reportedly using Cerebras."
2023-04-13 17:43:17,AllenAI's announcement this summer will change that mostly but I wouldn't swear by it yet
2023-04-13 17:44:28,"Cant tell about the long term play part, but they were a lot of talks about open ISAs because of risc-v and how they’re actually trying to democratise access to chip designs. They also talked a lot about open source."
2023-04-13 18:48:29,"folks, have you come across any open source LLMs that are strong with code generation & various programming languages?"
2023-04-13 18:51:19,"If I'm not wrong, Replit and Aws codewishperer are both using CodeGen"
2023-04-13 18:53:18,Anybody knows Something which can be hosted locally without internet... Can Alpaca be finetuned for local codebase?

2023-04-13 19:17:03,Will check this out 👍
2023-04-13 19:18:07,Agreed. OpenAI has kind of merged their codex model with GPT 3.5 turbo so they have a single purpose code generation model kind of integrated which makes it powerful

2023-04-14 11:16:22,Here's a new AI model called DreamPose that can generate Video from Image.
2023-04-14 11:36:43,do we need to finetune the model on the subject-specific image before creating the video?  [PHONE REMOVED]
2023-04-14 11:47:19,"Yeah it looks like it, https://github.com/johannakarras/DreamPose#finetune-on-sample"
2023-04-14 13:11:58,ok. noob question may be but how is this diffrent from an edge detection algorithm on steroid .
2023-04-14 14:04:42,"question: for smaller sets of data, what’ll be the difference between generating embeddings and storing them in vectorDBs v/s providing them directly to the LLM for question-answering?"
2023-04-14 14:07:49,If data set has >4000 tokens you have to chunk it and store them in dbs and do QA by taking relevant chunks….if it’s <4000 tokens you can directly ask LLM for QA.
2023-04-14 14:15:30,4k is still high. One should consider prompt tokens and tokens to generate in the answer too. Else they are left with just 97

2023-04-15 21:21:29,I have a question and I think people here would be well suited to answer
2023-04-15 21:21:30,"If projects like langchain are open-source, then why do they raise money? What are the economics here?"
2023-04-15 21:21:30,Ideally value proposition is the code. But if it's opensourced then why do people invest in that value proposition?
2023-04-15 21:22:23,Fowarded a thread I'm having elsewhere. Let me know if anyone has any understanding about this.
2023-04-15 21:23:09,"Users and distribution. As a man once said, your monetisation techiniques are very different when you have 10K users vs 10M users"
2023-04-15 21:23:17,Managed Services. Including enterprise. See dbt cloud for reference.
2023-04-15 21:25:19,Also people don't like writing code or reading docs. This is also the Fixie thesis
2023-04-15 21:23:57,OpenSUSE and RedHat open sourced their code. Still profitable by providing training and support
2023-04-15 21:24:10,"Don't know about langchain plans apart from the distribution, but generally open-source companies go in the self hosted and Cloud hosted startegies"

2023-04-16 09:12:16,Yeah agreed!
2023-04-16 09:12:51,"The interface is similar, but I think the big difference is that LLMs are conceptually structured, but untethered from reality. That I think is the big difference between multivac and LLMs"

2023-04-16 09:13:55,Multimodality will help a lot with that
2023-04-16 09:14:56,On the color front I just happened to come across this paper :) 
2023-04-16 09:15:24,Agreed they are largely conceptually structured

2023-04-16 09:16:49,Like in the “last question” the question asked over eons is can entropy be reversed. The fact that it took sooo long to answer because it is such a difficult question based on its understanding of reality was amazing

2023-04-16 10:58:16,Thank you
2023-04-16 11:00:58,I mostly use plus because it lets me use GPT-4 with large context windows and that turns out to be cost efficient. Do consider that.

2023-04-16 12:06:48,Correct
2023-04-16 12:07:42,"OpenAI embeddings are good but they would charge. Hence alternative ST , but con is image is huge"
2023-04-16 12:08:22,In the VM it works fine but when containerize ing it is becoming huge [ which is obvious ]
2023-04-16 12:10:41,May be deploying the model separately behind a service endpoint could be a way to go. That way you wont have to distribute the model in the application containers.
2023-04-16 12:13:13,Yes that's correct ; but the model itself is huge [ ST with all its fanfare Torch and … ] ; Are you suggesting deploying the Model in a VM and exposing as a service ?
2023-04-16 12:13:35,Yeah
2023-04-16 12:14:34,Thank you for your views
2023-04-16 12:16:03,I am just wondering how the community is thinking about using OpenAI for everything [ Embeddings and Chat Completion ]. My views are Embeddings can be done using ST and Hugging Face and reduce cost
2023-04-16 12:17:03,I agree.
2023-04-16 12:31:02,Have seen it start to work with 200 odd examples. OpenAI suggest 1000+ for accuracy. 
2023-04-16 12:32:32,Sorry I'm not sure i understand. Do you mean the image is large because of storing the vectors?
2023-04-16 12:32:59,Different than the OpenAI fine-tuning*
2023-04-16 12:33:38,"I am using Sentence Transformers for Word Embedding. The ST has dependencies on Torch and NVIDIA libraries , hence the image is large"
2023-04-16 12:34:41,Your standard flow is Embeddings + Chat Completion [ Very Himalaya level flow ] . For Embeddings to minimize cost using ST
2023-04-16 12:35:12,and Context / Chat Completion using OpenAI / Azure OpenAI
2023-04-16 12:36:10,It’s not recommended to use fine tuning where you can get away with embeddings.
2023-04-16 12:36:44,How many GBs are we talking about?
2023-04-16 12:37:01,> 5GB
2023-04-16 12:37:51,One solution from one helpful community member is to convert ST into ONNX format
2023-04-16 12:37:58,and this would reduce the size
2023-04-16 12:38:38,Any other solutions / viewpoints would be highly appreciated . even the approach is wrong with reason would also be highly appreciated
2023-04-16 12:39:52,I love this community . So very quick and helpful members
2023-04-16 12:42:03,"wait, I thought finetuning means providing extra/specific information to the model which it already doesn’t know. And, generating embeddings using relevant documents is a part of the process. Am I fundamentally wrong?"

2023-04-16 13:43:04,This is quite neat. I missed pinned messages for this!
2023-04-16 13:44:52,"Fine tuning adjusts the weights of a model, with more training samples. Embedding are usually used for similarity search(among other things)."
2023-04-16 13:47:16,"calculating embeddings is a part of adding “more training samples”, right? Or not necessarily…?"
2023-04-16 13:48:04,These things are orthogonal to each other.
2023-04-16 13:51:07,Are you talking about fine tuning the embedding model or something?
2023-04-16 13:51:34,These things are nuanced based on the context :)
2023-04-16 13:54:50,ah
2023-04-16 13:54:51,Think of it this way
2023-04-16 13:54:54,You can say embeddings is an LLM's mother tongue. It understands text by converting in into an embedding to understand the meaning and relation between words. Finetuning is giving the llm lot's of examples to learn a particular new skill or subject

2023-04-16 13:59:36,Anyway gpt3 embeddings are 1536 in length
2023-04-16 14:00:52,I see….
2023-04-16 14:03:44,"just trying to understand, so if this “intelligence” depends on the models’ weights, variance, etc which is obviously the case (basically upgrading from gpt3 to gpt4), there are ways to finetune, i.e., add more weights, etc. ourselves also? instead of waiting for a new release like gpt5?"
2023-04-16 14:05:21,I so long thought finetuning just means giving it more documents (storing the embeddings in a db)… i didn’t know there are ways to make the model smarter without burning huge computation powers
2023-04-16 14:07:15,Check this out https://huggingface.co/spaces/microsoft/HuggingGPT
2023-04-16 14:10:22,"Hmm ,think of embeddings as transformations (At very high level)"
2023-04-16 14:11:25,ya I understood that…
2023-04-16 14:11:26,When you fine tune a model
2023-04-16 14:12:21,what is the “process” of ‘finetuning’ then if not generating and storing embeddings?
2023-04-16 14:12:33,Providing it with prompts?
2023-04-16 14:12:51,to use those embeddings more smartly?
2023-04-16 14:12:52,"larger dof is not good for longer run, latency wise, too."
2023-04-16 14:12:59,Calling the api and updating the weights for your use cases.
2023-04-16 14:13:20,Weights being updated with example data
2023-04-16 14:14:12,Can I get a more comprehensive guide on how to ‘update these weights’ please?
2023-04-16 14:15:12,https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/fine-tuning
2023-04-16 14:15:18,Providing with example date like rightly said 
2023-04-16 14:16:16,There was recent tweet from someone about comparing fine-tuning and prompting. Will see if I can find it. That had some details of effects of fine tuning and what prompting can deliver.
2023-04-16 14:16:35,Tweet about a paper
2023-04-16 14:19:12,Make sure if finetuning is really necessary for your usecase (computational costs involved) or if you can simply  use a external vector database like pinecone or weaviate instead.
2023-04-16 14:24:07,"I had read a little bit of this when I was initially exploring, but never tried myself: ```question and answer pairs to additionally create adversarial questions and context pairs```"
2023-04-16 14:52:35,What do you people think of this?
2023-04-16 14:59:24,This is interesting but needs more finesse. 
2023-04-16 15:00:18,"Hey, not sure if this was asked here before, but how do we determine a good chunk size to use while converting a huge text dump + documents into embeddings. From what I understand a smaller chunk size make the extractions more ""precise"" while doing emb search but at the cost of much more computations wheras it's the opposite with large chunk size and also with larger chunk sizes we can't keep too many of the chunks in the final LLM prompt for answering the question. Any other ways of looking at this?"
2023-04-16 15:02:37,I think langchain's conversation memory types can be combined to optimise for your chunks

2023-04-16 17:45:49,yea it opens up that nyan cat youtube video 😄
2023-04-16 19:04:04,I tried asking GPT for this. This is what it responded with.
2023-04-16 19:05:26,A smart summariser Bot for WhatsApp groups will be really helpful.

2023-04-16 22:36:36,or is it just ranking them and using the closest match to the input
2023-04-16 22:37:16,Good questions
2023-04-16 22:37:36,Would love to hear what people have to say
2023-04-16 22:38:42,Auto GPT does have an intermediate summary phase where it tries to break the webpage down to 8192 token chunks
2023-04-16 22:40:17,Not sure whqts happening in here though
2023-04-16 22:41:17,makes sense..
2023-04-16 22:42:03,Anyone here who has worked extensively with these agents?
2023-04-16 22:42:03,There are few different things:
2023-04-16 22:42:30,[PHONE REMOVED] uses them almost daily to run his company and cribs about how broken they are
2023-04-16 22:57:11,If you do not like to use LLM for HTML parsing then this tool I found does a great job. But use it at arm distances because it is GPL3 licensed.
2023-04-16 23:12:30,not extensively yet but have the same experience.
2023-04-16 23:16:55,for now my plan is also to keep adding new tasks in classifier and seperating their workflow standalone
2023-04-16 23:36:52,"There are strategies in langchain for this.. map_reduce, refine, ..."
2023-04-16 23:38:56,Will read up on it. What's the umbrella term langchain uses for these?

2023-04-16 23:40:34,memory chains or conversation memory
2023-04-16 23:40:57,those are different I think
2023-04-16 23:41:45,Summarisation sounds about right
2023-04-16 23:42:11,Memory is retrieval
2023-04-16 23:42:30,Sorry. You are right. It's summarization
2023-04-17 00:22:06,"btw folks langchain discord has a ""ask-kapa-langchain"" channel for asking doubts. very useful bot while building with langchain. it's based on the langchain docs, codebase."

2023-04-17 00:39:49,I abandoned working on the prototype all together because of these issues 🥲

2023-04-17 00:45:29,The other party is trying to hack around that delivery logic
2023-04-17 00:45:41,True. The other side of this spectrum is someone building a resume builder to job candidates so that the resume is maximally similar to JD
2023-04-17 00:45:57,Never ending arms race
2023-04-17 00:46:50,"Yes, it's unethical. But if you won't use it, someone else probably will"
2023-04-17 00:48:08,"even today, recruiters don't do the first touch on resumes in big corps."
2023-04-17 00:48:09,Then the other side will start too :)
2023-04-17 00:48:41,There is also the matter of possible bias which the AI solutions might have. Which is difficult to solve for and a very sensitive issue.
2023-04-17 00:51:48,And then use chat GPT during the interview
2023-04-17 00:51:50,Boom
2023-04-17 00:52:31,Slightly off track but it reminds me of this dialogue from Batman Begins :)

2023-04-17 10:57:14,This seems to be GPT-3.5
2023-04-17 10:57:43,Someone tested using GPT-4 and they reported 21/108 questions being solved by GPT-4 
2023-04-17 10:59:55,"Also IMO these tests are very misleading ,it’s performance on zero shot prompting of JEE questions would obviously be poor "
2023-04-17 11:00:16,Present LLMs fake understanding
2023-04-17 11:00:23,"Plus we don’t really know what prompting strategy they have used, they might have simply kept the question and asked for the answer. Having a simple CoT based promoting strategy will probably lead to much better scores"
2023-04-17 11:00:38,Isn't having access to a Wolfram plugin basically cheating?
2023-04-17 11:01:13,It is sort of consistent with the fact that it cannot do complex math. For now. Physics and chemistry it can reproduce well with decent reasoning
2023-04-17 11:01:51,I’m 100% sure the ones reporting failure of GPT on JEE would be copy pasting questions in ChatGPT
2023-04-17 11:02:30,"""Significant gains are visible in the accuracy of the GPT4 model, in decreasing order of Chemistry(✨36%✨), Physics(14%), and Maths(3%) over ChatGPT on our challenge set"" thread says"
2023-04-17 11:02:39,"I’m curious to see the performance with Wolfram access + textbook content retrieval. Even though it’s kinda like cheating, considering the complexity of JEE it’s still impressive if it can solve with content retrieval and tools access as well"
2023-04-17 11:03:43,Also we're forgetting the value of negative marking
2023-04-17 11:03:51,"Exactly, these people just post results with some general prompting and then give a wrong impression"
2023-04-17 11:04:04,Not sure how else to train a LLM to solve complex math 
2023-04-17 11:04:19,Also perhaps there is some value in prompting it to skip math more than chem and physics
2023-04-17 11:04:30,Since it's dumber at maths
2023-04-17 11:05:18,+1 on this 
2023-04-17 11:05:50,In Zero shot prompting you’re just posting a question and taking at face value the first answer GPT provides
2023-04-17 11:05:51,Someone can experiment autogpt with jee and see where it leads
2023-04-17 11:06:02,Will be still useless with math I am guessing
2023-04-17 11:06:09,And also many low hanging fruit problems in JEE are repeat questions with slightly different values
2023-04-17 11:07:33,Also I'm sure GPT finishes the entire test in like 5 to 10 minutes
2023-04-17 11:09:47,And also sequential questions. Where one question's answer leads to the context of next one. I'm sure whoever implemented this experiment did not take into account the previous questions context and prompted GPT to answer it in isolation. 
2023-04-17 11:10:09,Anyone wants to join hands and work on this with me?
2023-04-17 11:11:24,Sure!

2023-04-17 11:14:48,"A lot of questions have diagrams as well, GPT4 can probably handle that but image functionality isn't even out yet afaik so that's also something to consider"
2023-04-17 11:15:21,"actually interesting idea, I could give this a try…"
2023-04-17 11:15:56,Clip it up
2023-04-17 11:16:23,Not going to help 100% of the time but that is indeed very valuable context

2023-04-17 11:17:05,Let's see
2023-04-17 11:17:27,If it isn't then we'll just prompt it to be a little hesitant in answering diagram based questions
2023-04-17 11:17:30,CLIP + some OCR logic + some prompting on top of that maybe idk
2023-04-17 11:17:33,Can probably glue up something like Amazon's MM-CoT and see if that helps with diagrams and figures? cc [PHONE REMOVED]

2023-04-17 11:35:37,You can create a separate prompt for determining the question type. In the prompt you can keep the three options in MCQ format at the end of the prompt so you can easily parse the output. Keep this prompt at the very beginning before the retrieval part

2023-04-17 22:03:52,"We build some models and ensemble some others. Our use case is deliberately narrow- we don’t need super powers. Besides, the problem with LLMs is that you have no control over them at all. If an LLM doesn’t behave the way you want it to, what will you do? Prompt tinkering is ok but it assumes that the LLM is perfect. And it isn’t. There are other issues with prebuilt LLMs as well which makes it tough to use in an enterprise environment."

2023-04-18 18:54:51,"I faced a similar problem where the text (customer feedback) language was unknown to us. So we added one step to detect text language and then prompted LLM to specifically reply in that language. In some cases (especially in code mix text) we did this via two-step chains. First, detect language using prompt and later pass it as a param to another."

2023-04-18 18:57:23,But audio is a bit more difficult
2023-04-18 18:59:03,Not worked in audio.
2023-04-18 19:00:20,exactly what I started using.. by specifying the language it works for a generic question
2023-04-18 19:55:41,https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=30xueN12guw
2023-04-18 20:05:14,How easy/complex was this language detection/translation?
2023-04-18 20:05:29,And did it introduce some latency?
2023-04-18 20:20:26,[PHONE REMOVED] check this. If API based solution then it will add latency for sure.
2023-04-18 20:20:41,"Of the top of my head - Cut out a very short snippet of the audio, then use something like deepgram or whisper?"
2023-04-18 20:20:56,"smaller the file, lower the latency is my guess.. but haven't tried it"
2023-04-18 20:22:51,"Best way to do this imo will be by sampling. Splice the audio into smaller chunks, hit parallelly, and give a best case score if your use case is language detection, else concatenate and map reduce for translation"
2023-04-18 20:25:53,"One issue is translation depends on context too, so chunks can’t be super small"
2023-04-18 20:35:39,So you can split on gaps in amplitude. With a rule like 5 gaps in one chunk
2023-04-18 20:49:33,This might actually make for a good cost reduction (compromising latency though) use case as well. Read the amplitude and omit parts of the audio where no sound was detected and then translate/transcribe
2023-04-18 20:51:29,Yeah that's pretty common in audio pre processing.
2023-04-18 20:51:50,Interesting.. didn’t know that
2023-04-18 20:52:53,Same for text too. we remove white spaces and new lines to save for tokens in document chunks.

2023-04-18 23:25:54,Can you explain what you mean by you have existing designs? Is it some type of sketch? Also can you elaborate on “segment various attributes of UI elements “ 
2023-04-18 23:27:56,Try this gradio space if you already have a sketch. https://huggingface.co/spaces/hysts/ControlNet
2023-04-18 23:32:17,"My understanding is that the maximum amount of control right now comes from control net models. Given that multiple controllers can be clubbed together and img2img and inpainting is also supported, with even huggingface launching a control net sprint , we will get a lot of community controlnets which can be used. T2I adapters is another approach but controlnet has community momentum with it."

2023-04-19 00:29:43,"This was my thought too. This just violates some assumptions for linear regression variants, you can consider 1. other regression algorithms like tree based ones, or 2. See if the target can be transformed via a sensible function to close to normal distribution."
2023-04-19 00:30:43,2. *and then apply liner regression family
2023-04-19 00:32:29,Can you elaborate what you mean by confined? And really bad for what exactly?
2023-04-19 00:32:40,"Also, can you plot it somehow?"
2023-04-19 00:32:52,"I tried using support vector regression and experimented with non linear kernels, the results remained the same. Will try tree based methods as well."
2023-04-19 00:40:27,"Also, really sorry if I am making some stupid remarks/comments about the data. I have not worked a lot with tabular data, and I am just a beginner in Machine Learning."
2023-04-19 00:42:08,This is not some sort of time series data?
2023-04-19 00:45:45,No it’s not a time series data
2023-04-19 01:17:07,It's not a function in the traditional sense. It could the case that y = some_prob_distribution(x). Ex. Y = normal_distributed(mean =x)

2023-04-19 10:19:06,Do you think dependence on these for home work affect reasoning abilities in kids?
2023-04-19 10:22:04,I want to use it in ChatBot style. So I want to build it on something like GPT-4 or any other LLMs. 
2023-04-19 10:22:18,"Yes, in my view"
2023-04-19 10:25:07,"yes. you just retrive the relavant context with cosine similarity , and simply feed it into the prompt. with character limit . it should work well . with some prompt engineering + if you using GPT4 put in the system message  to impersonate you based on the context provide.

2023-04-19 10:26:12,Do you think dependency on Google Search and Saved contacts affect our memory skills?

2023-04-20 13:55:53,I haven't worked with the API yet. So wouldn't know. Also the diffusers library isn't upToDate with the latest release. This is because the repo author is working on integrating it with automatic1111 first.

2023-04-20 15:17:11,"The best way to insert an external object like a glass into another image is to just overlay it in another layer using photoshop or free web based photopea. Export as a single image (img1). Also export an image in the same dimensions but with only the glass and the rest of the background black (img2). Then inpaint over and around the glass in img1. Load img2 into controlnet. Use canny, depth, hed maps or a combo of these based on the kind of object. Adjust the controlnet weight appropriately. Also adjust the weight of the right word in the prompt like (glass:1.2)."
2023-04-20 15:20:20,Another way to achieve the same thing is to load just the glass image with transparent bg into controlnet. and only use the canny / depth / hed preprocessor (not the model). Download the map. Position the map image according to your final image dimensions such that it is exactly where you want the generation to happen. Black the rest of the background and export as another image. Load this image into controlnet and this time leave the preprocessor blank. Only select the appropriate model. This works great because your object map is already perfectly positioned where you want it in the image.
2023-04-20 15:31:05,This is awesome [PHONE REMOVED] Thanks a lot for this. I'll update once I have setup Automatic UI.
2023-04-20 16:12:10,How hard to push per key API results to Prometheus? From there use any UI tool like grafana to monitor per API usages.
2023-04-20 16:40:34,Is anyone using GPT4 in prod? I'm sending gpt-4 as the model but its still using gpt-4-0314. Have heard gpt-4 is much more faster than the 0314
2023-04-20 17:02:09,Anyone have any clue if multimodal LLMs are good reading images of documents? Say for OCR.
2023-04-20 17:04:28,Which LLM’s? Pix2instruct? Or any other LLM?
2023-04-20 17:10:17,say GPT-4? I know the multi-modal functionality is not rolled out yet but curious of  Visual Document Q&A is an application since you can ask it questions about images.
2023-04-20 17:11:46,I was just checking out this repo: https://github.com/clovaai/donut
2023-04-20 17:11:50,Tesseract was a great solution for OCR the last time I tried but I'm not sure about it's performance in production environments
2023-04-20 17:11:53,Doesn’t use OCR
2023-04-20 17:14:34,"I've tried it, hard to fine tune to your use case and get consistent results"
2023-04-20 17:15:51,Ya tesseract is great. I’m coming from the perspective of one model to rule them all. It’s clear that LLMs have absorbed a lot of vertical NLP usecases. Wondering if I can just use a multimodal LLM in the future for OCR also instead of using tesseract or a AWS/GCP API
2023-04-20 17:18:19,"In all likelihood, yes. Microsoft's LayoutLMv3 already does OCR: https://huggingface.co/microsoft/layoutlmv3-base"

2023-04-20 17:27:25,"Would something like this be better and faster for resume parsing tasks, compared to feeding the resume text to an LLM and asking it to parse?"

2023-04-20 17:29:40,"Got it, thanks."

2023-04-20 18:03:10,"Sounds reasonable. Additionally, can I audit the requests made to each api key?"
2023-04-20 18:09:12,Labels can be used to pass API key hash or user friendly name (do not pass exact API key :))
2023-04-20 18:19:18,I tried using MM-REACT using hugging face space provided by them. It works much better than Donut. The work uses Reasoning capabilities of LLMs to extract information from visually rich documents

2023-04-21 14:45:33,My Ola's ex-colleague built this. See if this is helpful 
2023-04-21 15:36:32,"""Researchers are exploring a curious phenomenon known as in-context learning, in which a large language model learns to accomplish a task after seeing only a few examples"" (from https://news.mit.edu/2023/large-language-models-in-context-learning-0207 ) "
2023-04-21 15:39:53,https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712 in this paper Microsoft researchers who had early access describes to an extent how they think it works. Finally they also conclude they don't know how it works 🙁

2023-04-21 15:55:04,+github copilot ofc
2023-04-21 15:58:18,"Love how ""Langchain it"" is becoming a verb here"
2023-04-21 16:45:36,"Am sorry if I'm missing something here. What's new in this? Isn't this what we have been doing in most LLM apps? Just feed the context. Model won't ""learn"" anything."
2023-04-21 16:47:38,"In context learning examples include input/output pairs, not just stuffing data into the prompt"
2023-04-21 16:53:08,There is an interesting Microsoft paper that checks the values at various layers of the transformer when giving examples in the prompt vs fine tuning the models with the same examples for 1 epoch. They find similar values in both and have a theory that prompting with examples causes implicit gradient descent which helps the model perform on the unseen example.

2023-04-23 16:52:20,"I saw this tweet by the guy who made BabyAGI, with a new approach to vector search & embeddings: https://twitter.com/yoheinakajima/status/1650049673770725378?s=46&t=WT1iAtjftW-5_e62F8FZTg"
2023-04-23 16:53:00,"He then goes on to say that the “paper”, the code, and the twitter thread as well, were all created with ChatGPT"
2023-04-23 16:53:24,Can the experts here explain if this is all fluff or has actual basis?
2023-04-23 16:53:35,https://yoheinakajima.com/asymmetrix-asymmetric-vector-embeddings-for-directional-similarity-search/
2023-04-23 16:55:55,Not fluff. Nakajima has been tinkering with AGI for long
2023-04-23 16:56:42,"Yep. I was referring to this new technique for vector search which he came up with, or chatgpt came up with"
2023-04-23 17:11:29,Lol. He literally said he has idea what it does.
2023-04-23 17:13:42,Well I didn’t say he didn’t knew what he’s talking about or that what he’s speaking is fluff.
2023-04-23 17:15:08,"Yep. Still assimilating. Atleast from a reco system lens can comment : in theory, this can potentially be a good approach"
2023-04-23 20:36:28,"what are some places to hire tech folks interested in GenAI? understanding of how GenAI works and the nuances of embeddings, text processing"
2023-04-23 20:37:13,This WhatsApp group 🙈
2023-04-23 20:39:03,I hear OpenAI has some decent folks
2023-04-23 20:39:32,should have a job board :)
2023-04-23 20:41:40,This would be helpful - looking for an AD/Director of ML for my team too 🙌🏼
2023-04-23 20:42:30,How about a board that takes natural language input from job seekers and start-ups and matches them? Does something like this exist? Shouldn't be hard to build one.
2023-04-23 20:43:06,Looking to hire folks as well - full time or part time! Job board would be ideal
2023-04-23 20:44:17,"I knew tokens used for non English languages is different but looking at the OpenAI bills, it gave me a shock. Some Asian languages take a lot more - is there a comparsion somewhere?"
2023-04-23 21:11:15,Oh it’s ridiculous. 
2023-04-23 21:16:53,I haven’t come across a lang2lang comparison. But openAi has a tokenizer you can use to estimate tokens and build a comparison set.
2023-04-23 21:21:11,"For tokenization and word embeddings to reduce cost, you may like to use Sentence Transformers / [ something like that ] and pass the Embeddings to OpenAI for completion"

2023-04-24 12:26:02,https://e2eml.school/transformers.html
2023-04-24 12:26:11,Yeah the demographic data isn't available but the percentage of users in India is just going up month on month
2023-04-24 12:27:19,Same here. Hear anecdotal evidence of kids going majorly into it. My 12 yo son using it to rephrase stuff from Wikipedia for school essays 🤣😅

2023-04-24 13:47:27,"Yeah, by default, workshops will be paid. Upto the educator to price them. Can set this up early May and ask here :)"
2023-04-24 14:05:55,"So the way me and Nirant have been thinking to structure like 1 product/usage/use-case talk, 1 deep dive into some engg optimisations/libraries/use-cases and 1 deep dive into fundamentals."

2023-04-24 14:56:40,"Hey [PHONE REMOVED] can you explain a bit on ""creating realistic images"" specifically what would be the topics on this. Is it prompt oriented or model oriented or something else?"
2023-04-24 15:35:12,Sure works - was thinking this would be similar to Amod’s talk but can do a paid workshop too
2023-04-24 15:35:21,Makes sense
2023-04-24 15:35:27,Both - but mostly model oriented and more complex dreambooth methods

2023-04-24 21:18:04,Has anyone noticed differences between using newlines/replacing them when using openai's embedding api?
2023-04-24 21:19:32,"While you're at it, [PHONE REMOVED] and I'd love to know why Langchain does a newline replacement too 😅"
2023-04-24 21:38:06,\n is probably not a token in the vocabulary
2023-04-24 21:42:30,Creating a token from an unknown world and having it in the vocabulary is different. The model’s vocabulary are words that it understands to encode into something meaningful in the encoder.
2023-04-24 21:43:46,Can you elaborate or rephrase a bit? I didn't understand
2023-04-24 21:44:48,https://www.livemint.com/companies/start-ups/indian-engineering-colleges-lead-generative-ai-research-projects-in-indic-languages-facing-challenges-in-data-sourcing-and-computing-power-11681663553393.html
2023-04-24 21:46:11,"Let’s take a NLP model from huggingface which follows the transformer library specification. It will have a vocab file in it, you will see the vocabulary of the model, words  it was trained to encode. New line, tabs are not part of vocabulary."
2023-04-24 21:46:40,So while a newline could be a token it doesn’t have any semantic meaning when it’s encoded.
2023-04-24 21:47:34,"Aaah, that'd make sense. Thanks for explaining!"
2023-04-24 21:49:42,"So to rephrase the original question —  if we have the original vocab file for GPT3.5 and that has a newline, adding/removing it makes a semantic difference and vice versa?"
2023-04-24 21:54:10,"If the vocabulary has new lines, you could keep them. But for all practical purposes I haven’t seen models contain any space, tab or new lines in models"
2023-04-24 21:54:30,You will use up tokens and not get any advantage in terms of results
2023-04-24 21:54:39,"Sometimes, new line matters for text splitting/ chunking. (Such as splitting by para). Then the /n has meaning, correct?"
2023-04-24 21:55:10,I'm referring to text splitting pre-embedding
2023-04-24 21:55:50,Those are character splitters. Yeah they look into these control characters.
2023-04-24 21:56:50,"The assumption from the model author is that you would split texts the way you see fit and then remove unknown vocabulary, tokenize and then feed the texts into the model."
2023-04-24 21:57:57,*text splitters
2023-04-24 22:02:51,My approach for choosing splitting and sanitizing texts would be to run some experiments and see what preserves or improved the performance of the model with the least number of tokens.
2023-04-24 22:03:22,Context length obviously plays a role also. Can’t go longer than ctx supported.
2023-04-24 22:03:30,might be the reason for the extra tokens too? As the new line + word is not recognised as a common enough token
2023-04-24 22:04:25,You could look into the source code of the tiktoken library on GitHub to see how they are doing it. It’s purely heuristics.
2023-04-24 22:04:49,The tokenizer is called C100k or something
2023-04-24 22:05:48,gpt-4 uses a different tokenizer but they haven't updated the url you linked with that.
2023-04-24 22:06:50,yes

2023-04-25 01:21:06,idk honestly. yours is also low temp. so maybe more difficult than usual? my understanding is that most prompt injection out there is tested on the default temperature 0.7

2023-04-25 13:17:54,Is fine tuning necessary?
2023-04-25 13:18:28,I did kind of a similar approach to create diagrams using MermaidJS. Created embeddings from the docs and added gpt-3.5. Worked well for the most part
2023-04-25 13:20:37,Most of these components have several parameters that they accept that define the behaviour of the UI component.
2023-04-25 13:22:08,Plan of action that I have in mind:
2023-04-25 13:25:48,"Afaik, fine tuning is only available for base models not for RLHF'ed/SFT models. So you may see degradation in performance."

2023-04-25 19:19:46,"why not? at least thats the idea wit medical AI, as of now humans by nature will not trust AI diagnosis any more than a human doctor's diagnosis. AI assisted healthcare makes sense from both effort minimization and improving patient outcome"

2023-04-25 21:03:43,Open Source (Llama 30B-based) rival to ChatGPT from Huggingface:
2023-04-25 21:03:58,Must be WA blue 🤣
2023-04-25 21:06:10,You're welcome :P Did this via apple app on mac in case there's an actual constraint on other devices :P
2023-04-25 21:26:20,"Fine tuning vs sending long, detailed prompts is a very interesting topic/Product design requirement"
2023-04-25 21:28:26,My biz perspective is use out of box to test if it will give a satisfactory but not great output and then build your moat via fine tuning once the use case starts having traction. 
2023-04-25 21:28:45,Added Q to above:
2023-04-25 21:28:46,*satisfactory output
2023-04-25 21:28:48,https://manifold.markets/IsaacKing/will-any-llm-have-a-context-window
2023-04-25 21:29:06,Related discussion here https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=35682424
2023-04-25 21:31:01,"Interesting, are we saying that few-shot in-context learning is how FMs will be deployed in production?"
2023-04-25 21:31:29,"Noob question: I work at an education company. We finetuned chatgpt's davinci model on some of our content to see if it can create good new content. Results so far are fairly poor, and I'm wondering if this should be expected since gpt-3.5 and gpt-4 significantly raised the bar from previous versions? Has anyone else seen sub-par quality output from finetuned models? Are there other options (such as Huggingface transformers) that might work better?"
2023-04-25 21:31:49,Particularly when the context window will support 32K or 100K+ tokens which can fit all fine tuning data ?
2023-04-25 21:32:08,How do we think of expenses?
2023-04-25 21:32:26,More input tokens would mostly mean more expensive API calls?
2023-04-25 21:33:24,Expenses is ~ # of context window tokens to and fro on OpenAI atleast
2023-04-25 21:33:44,"My understanding so far is that GPT 4 especially is very capable for most use cases with few shot in-context learning. So would be easier to test and learn like this, figure the nuances of the use case and then evaluate smaller fine tuned models."
2023-04-25 21:33:52,Makes sense. With that in mind 1M tokens of context will be much worse on $ than fine tuning maybe.
2023-04-25 21:35:00,But say we were using an open source model (Llama? alpaca? Of the future) where pricing isn’t a factor of token count. The large context window approach will work better with more flexibility?
2023-04-25 21:35:45,Open question still - anyone tried both approaches?
2023-04-25 21:37:24,(Adding to what Karan said)
2023-04-25 21:41:44,I think it's a function of Product maturity
2023-04-25 21:44:59,"If it's a multi tenant setup, I think it's better to finetune on the combined data for all tenants and then use few-shot prompting to refine for every customer."
2023-04-25 21:49:58,"Umm, if I'm a chatbot/conversational AI company and have competing customers (say Axis and HDFC) as my clientele, I'd likely have a base model and fine-tuned (forked) versions of the same running inside the environments of Axis and HDFC"
2023-04-25 21:52:01,The former use-case was via anecdotal research
2023-04-25 21:53:05,How much are we seeing Indian clients caring about their data being used for model training? Is it just regulatory heavy industries like banking or are non-reg industries saying the same? (Eg Ed-tech)
2023-04-25 21:53:39,https://www.researchgate.net/publication/370213628_Scaling_Transformer_to_1M_tokens_and_beyond_with_RMT
2023-04-25 21:54:22,Personal experience from a limited sample set - more about the use-case than regulations
2023-04-25 21:58:43,"I think no ML product company can exist if *none* of their customers are ready to share their data for training purposes. So let's say big banks like Axis and HDFC are not ready, then the base model can't be trained on their data. But smaller banks might be ready to share their data for a lower price of implementation etc. (assuming this). So base model can be trained on the banks using the lower pricing tier and few shot prompting etc can be used for the Axis and HDFCs of the world, on-premise to make it work for their data. "
2023-04-25 22:00:22,Also important to build a differentiated solution. Else anyone can create the wrapper without fine tuning
2023-04-25 22:01:31,Well said. We have a similar vision - start with embeddings and then at some point fine tune per client (maybe per team)
2023-04-25 22:01:35,Precisely why AI has higher marginal costs (and poorer GMs) than traditional cloud software
2023-04-25 22:03:28,You can get away with embeddings right? So there’s no training?
2023-04-25 22:10:20,discussing this for a complicated usecase where finetuning is required in some capacity. So pureplay embeddings and few shot prompting won't work is the assumption here.
2023-04-25 22:12:44,"Those models doesn't not have RLHF etc, not just smaller models. So you will be seeing perf similar to GPT3 and some more: your fine tuning. You will need other models and then train RLHF or use one of the RLHF trained models and try. Haven't done the last part. You will most likely need to fine tune RLHF as well, as the new models might have drifted in the output space."
2023-04-25 22:16:54,"Very true. But at the same time all these companies are trusting MS, Goog and AWS with their data. One of our customers, large multinational, had absolute 'no' few weeks ago to if you can provide guarantee, nothing will be leaked, you can use OpenAI. Unfortunately, OpenAI fine print isn't that black and white."
2023-04-25 22:17:32,What's the exact fine print that is difficult to decipher?
2023-04-25 22:18:15,"From what I understand, context is the application's and not Open AIs but want to understand this further."
2023-04-25 22:18:34,Tell them they’ll loose everything when their competition uses chatgpt to outperform them 😗😝
2023-04-25 22:19:29,Scare is definitely one approach haha :D
2023-04-25 22:19:30,And it took the big 3 15 odd years to instil this trust
2023-04-25 22:20:09,"Or tell them you’re using azure, azure has like a direct passthrough of gpt"
2023-04-25 22:20:15,"Used replicate and runpod.io, would recommend both for serverless and stateful use cases"
2023-04-25 22:20:18,"In typical Amazon fashion, better selection inside a VPC that customers trust with Anthropic which is possibly the biggest competitor to OAI today"
2023-04-25 22:23:06,"It feels like a good tool for scaffolding, but also a bit blind. The way the repo is also feels limiting. "
2023-04-25 22:24:24,"Their wordings are something like ""OpenAI may use content to provide and maintain services"". What he heard from an OpenAI engineer was won't be used for training* (*to be verified by the engineer). Don't know if Nirant or others heard an update from their team."

2023-04-25 22:31:03,"Open AI engineer Boris Power - ""Prompting leads to faster results, with fine tuning it's painful to edit with changing data. Use fine tuning for exact format of input and output and if you have lots of historical high quality data. New use cases - fine tuning acts a lot of cost. Fine tuning doesn't do well when you need to understand facts and then provide the output"""

2023-04-25 23:06:33,Already did this. Like how this is fine print on the website since Sam said the purpose of releasing chatgpt to the world was (high frequency / diverse) user feedback.
2023-04-25 23:07:54,*this was
2023-04-25 23:54:08,"Openai doesn't need customer data to improve models at this stage.    No data sent over api by platform customers has ever been used.  When asked about it, they said they are just keeping the data around for 30 days for trust and safety."
2023-04-26 00:27:44,"OpenAI not needing data: Highly doubt that claim, they like everyone else would happily take more data. Esp when they are out of training data for GPT (they have exhausted text data). But also as feedback for fine-tuning layers like RLHF. The key there is they don't use API day, chatting on website probably will be used as is (which they say as well, in the free version). Ideally if they really don't need data, they should give a zero knowledge guarantee. They don't use input or output. But could they use intermediate layer info, can their folks eyeball it to improve the system. All those are probably open questions."
2023-04-26 00:30:13,I think multinationals too will move to start using them. Their models are quite good and it is just a matter of time.
2023-04-26 00:36:20,"They do need more data, just not api platform customer data."
2023-04-26 00:37:48,Data Partnership: Interesting.
2023-04-26 00:51:42,Anyone have a list of data partners for Open AI?
2023-04-26 00:54:47,Nah... They don't talk about how they train their new models either in terms of data or architecture...  Their platform api  data policy is public info though...
2023-04-26 09:29:53,"I spent a day in march at openai office when they have invited some startups. They are very much looking to get more data to train their models from the industry because they have exhausted internet and academic datasets. However their organization is so small that they are able to cater to partnership proposals only from the biggest tech companies right now, all of which are lining up at their door. Over time they may get to your request."
2023-04-26 10:49:12,"Woah, it would have easily made 90%'ile in my undergrad randomized algo course at IIT."
2023-04-26 10:50:42,"If it helps, BITS Pilani did not have a randomized algo course — we had a design and analysis of algorithms, which was more analysis than design: And even Turbo does better than on those questions (specially speed!) than I do even today 😅"

2023-04-26 10:59:07,"Widely known to maybe scientists, not discussed much I feel"
2023-04-26 11:00:15,"Fair, I might be suffering some form of inside-track groupthink here 😅"
2023-04-26 11:06:16,"To many, I wouldn't think it does"
2023-04-26 11:06:49,"Aligned, it's a utility like ec2 in 3 years or sooner"
2023-04-26 11:19:45,100% - this is the difference between AI now and 5 years back.
2023-04-26 11:20:27,The UX of consuming models was not great up until openai came into the picture.
2023-04-26 11:22:14,Still kinda sad that HF hasn't learned this well enough tbh
2023-04-26 11:22:55,"Once we have a well supported IR which works across all platforms, serving and consuming models from source would become a lot easier too."
2023-04-26 11:23:53,They were born at a different time. Compared to their competition at that time(2017-18) they have done well.
2023-04-26 11:24:48,Almost everyone who does NLP now makes their models work their transformer library.

2023-04-27 08:48:55,I faced this problem before. We used some form of leaky bucket to smoothen the API calling rate.
2023-04-27 08:50:02,Not particularly for OpenAI but for a general solution for limiting API calling rates.
2023-04-27 08:53:42,"429s, use the retry-after. Are you getting rate limited for requests or tokenS?"

2023-04-27 09:55:45,https://tetrate.io/blog/wasm-modules-and-envoy-extensibility-explained-part-1/
2023-04-27 09:58:48,"These enovy, istio, nginx are API proxy and they have a customised layer where we can add multiple filters. These filters can extend functionality. Which you can write in Lua, Wasm etc. Lua interpreters bring less overhead and way faster than python interpreter."
2023-04-27 10:04:49,Things like if you are testing multiple models on production one is main other are tests. And you like to send prod requests to all and then like to monitor outcomes. For this generally you need to write code. But in the case of these proxies you simply need to write small Lua or even yaml. And this proxy itself sends requests to all these services (which host models) and passes the response of the main service to the caller/client.

2023-04-27 11:02:32,"Think of a continuous model training process with multiple forks, each ""named"" or versioned model is a actually a checkpoint in that. "
2023-04-27 11:03:31,"Workflow wise: Say you build on 0314 or any other 3 month model, when it gets deprecated, you have to explicitly upgrade and you'll be prepared to run your entire battery of tests again. This is better than a silent upgrade where the behaviour of underlying model changes silently."

2023-04-27 12:08:44,"Might be useful for you,i was trying to train a Bloom model  and i was running out of GPU memory..and this gradient notebook helped me https://github.com/rasbt/gradient-accumulation-blog/blob/main/src/1_batchsize-1.py where if we want to use a batch size of 256 but can only fit a batch size of 64 into GPU memory, we can perform gradient accumulation over four batches of size 64. (After processing all four batches, we will have the accumulated gradients equivalent to a single batch of size 256.) This allows us to effectively emulate a larger batch size without requiring larger GPU memory or tensor sharding across different devices."
2023-04-27 12:17:06,"As I have mentioned, tried all possible combinations with gradient accumulation as well. Problem is of memory leak"

2023-04-28 12:56:21,"I totally agree! But in their defence, this space has been moving too fast for most people to catch up on. I'm surprised that most people have not heard of ReAct, but then know about AutoGPT :P"

2023-04-28 12:58:25,"Also, AutoGPT has fantastic marketing. Credit due where it is due."
2023-04-28 13:00:54,Did it actually do anything useful yet? Haven't seen any impressive results so far.
2023-04-28 13:02:14,AutoGPT has been major disappointment from the hype prospective
2023-04-28 13:04:07,it is only aboe to do small things/tasks with bounded scopes and well-defined goals 
2023-04-28 13:07:36,Can do basic financial analysis of companies. Somehow gets the easiest thing (getting the right current price from google) wrong. But was able to so SWOT + competitive analysis + DCF
2023-04-28 13:09:57,"This could be a stupid question but beyond customisability (and maybe power), what's the difference between bing (powered by GPT) and AutoGPT for basic questions? Both have access to the latest information through search."
2023-04-28 13:10:00,"Have done market sizing and memo writing using AutoGPT, but takes alot of time and gets into loops too often"

2023-04-28 13:19:27,"Bing has a lot longer context window — so can reason over more search results, is basically free for most people, easier to use."
2023-04-28 13:19:42,"AutoGPT took all the learnings developed by langchain, vectors DBs etc etc and made it available for the wider non-developer audience to use in the format they understand better. "
2023-04-28 13:19:44,Bing is also not powered 100% by GPT but uses an internal MSFT model quite often

2023-04-28 17:05:11,"What impact you foresee? Large Model, Faster Model, or new model arch?"
2023-04-28 17:13:47,Coreweave talks about tier 3 datacenters in north america. What does that mean? Do we have any in India as well?
2023-04-28 17:22:27,"Mostly faster inference in the 3-6 month horizon as compute providers figure this out, and perhaps more Fp16, Fp8/int8 proliferation for task-specific models"
2023-04-28 17:55:40,Faster inference means lesser costs because you can handle higher concurrent users per gpu
2023-04-28 19:04:38,"If I was running a serverless GPU company with mixed-GPUs e.g. A100, H100, P100 and what not — I'd resist the temptation to pass on these cost savings to customers. Mainly because I'm not quite sure how many customers will pay for 3x faster use cases"
2023-04-28 19:10:24,"Also at times you can’t guarantee to spawn up some of the higher end GPUs on demand, leading to slower spawn up time for users"
2023-04-28 19:10:56,"I doubt you'll have this luxury for long, imo serverless gpus are a perfect competition model with market competition dictating  the pricing instead of arbitrary end user value"

2023-04-29 00:49:43,Very lame question: Does LlamaIndex or Langchain support VectorDB with Sources with GPT4 or GPT3.5-Turbo? 
2023-04-29 00:50:51,"If yes, can you please point me to the right docs 😅"
2023-04-29 00:50:59,what does vectordb with sources with gpt mean?
2023-04-29 00:52:30,"Say the Vector DB replies with Doc1, 3, 5, 7 and only 5, 7 are actually used by the LLM to answer the question — I want the response to include 5, 7"

2023-04-29 00:53:49,response.source_nodes should give you the sources.
2023-04-29 00:54:11,"That gives 1, 3, 5, 7 — all top k"
2023-04-29 00:55:26,"ohh okay. Sorry, I misunderstood then. One way is to use evaluation module on top these to get only 5, 7 are being used."
2023-04-29 00:56:53,I have a hack for this
2023-04-29 00:57:35,Use this prompt - 
2023-04-29 00:57:54,Then simply parse the citations returned using regex
2023-04-29 00:58:25,I've tried variants of this. Not consistent enough unfortunately across questions. Do you change the system prompt in some way?
2023-04-29 00:59:53,Works very consistently
2023-04-29 01:00:09,(Haven't experimented with gpt-4 though yet)
2023-04-29 01:01:10,Including instructions and search results in system prompt made it forget the instructions sometimes
2023-04-29 01:01:22,So moved them to user prompt
2023-04-29 01:05:32,"This technique also in my experience has the added benefit of producing more grounded results, because you are kinda forcing it to cite sources. (Not sure why it works at all though)"
2023-04-29 01:21:59,OpenAI models don’t do this. What you want is basically the LLMs to cite references.

2023-04-29 01:31:14,"what could be reasons that the methodology can’t be ported to GPT-4? (I haven’t looked at the code yet, only did a cursory read on this today)"
2023-04-29 01:32:39,Do you mean LLM or code reasons? There are no LLM reasons
2023-04-29 01:33:28,Replacing the OpenAI() classes in the example with ChatOpenAI() doesn't work?
2023-04-29 01:33:50,Code reasons - is the “return_only_outputs” prop not available for ChatCompletions
2023-04-29 01:33:52,Code Reasons: Langchain is structured around separation of LLMs and Vector Indices — the Chat LLMs (e.g. ```ChatOpenAI```) prompts aren't compatible with these other operands like qa_with_sources
2023-04-29 01:34:29,You’ll have to extend the chain functions I guess..
2023-04-29 01:34:36,"Llama Index: [PHONE REMOVED] can share more context, but I think they've just gotten around to it. From what I can tell, they have no such limitations"

2023-04-29 01:36:12,"Yeah, sometimes I've to enforce that ""stay on topic"" policy to myself 🤣"
2023-04-29 01:36:28,Langchain is very complex though. Tried doing some very simple modifications today and I just gave up and went back to good old OpenAI libs
2023-04-29 01:36:41,"My eyes can’t believe this, what error does it throw?"
2023-04-29 01:36:45,It's definitely not meant for simple things
2023-04-29 01:38:14,OpenAI has a function in one of their libs to convert chat prompts to text ones and vice versa - that’s needed here I guess 😅
2023-04-29 01:38:47,"Wait, what. I've not seen this. Is this part of their default Python SDK? If not, can you link it here?"

2023-04-29 13:22:21,Nirant is busy tomorrow.
2023-04-29 13:31:15,"Hey guys. I am trying to build something with Generative AI in the advertisement space. I don’t have much idea on what exactly I should be doing and what are the issues faced by those running ads. So speaking with a few people who have experience running ads. If you know anyone or if you yourself are someone working on advertisements, would love to connect and discuss."
2023-04-29 13:31:45,My name is Srinath btw. And I am a final year BTech student.
2023-04-29 13:32:55,Would love to help [PHONE REMOVED] . Dm me whenever free
2023-04-29 13:33:20,"Folks, please reach out to our friend directly :)"
2023-04-29 13:33:28,Thanks Nitish. DMing you.
2023-04-29 13:43:09,"Hello everyone, I am Apurva. I am building a product to make content viral on social media using generative AI. "
2023-04-29 15:29:28,"Folks, I have an interesting research problem statement. I would like to build a generative model to generate legible pdf/image documents (text + image basically)."
2023-04-29 15:34:13,Looks like all the Mohits are looking for same use case. 😂
2023-04-29 15:34:48,Brilliant. We can call our library mohit then!
2023-04-29 15:35:14,Definitely 💯
2023-04-29 15:42:27,Would anyone know a transcription open source or paid API that can handle hindi/english as well as indian regional languages
2023-04-29 15:42:48,OpenAI Whisper does this off the bat
2023-04-29 15:44:02,"I tried assemblyAI as well but they are expensive, are there any other that I may have missed?"
2023-04-29 15:45:00,[PHONE REMOVED] should definitely be able to help!
2023-04-29 15:47:01,thanks will dm him
2023-04-29 15:55:55,"Building this but for CSVs at the moment, would love to chat!"
2023-04-29 16:00:23,For Hindi there are whisper models trained for Hindi from IITM.
2023-04-29 16:00:25,Deepgram built using whisper works good as well. They give $200 credit to try it out.
2023-04-29 16:37:05,You can try monster api as well
2023-04-29 16:49:59,If somebody is trying out deepgram nova vs Whisper - would love to hear results from both
2023-04-29 17:02:45,You don't need generative models for this. Converting raw text to PDFs/images and then applying simple distortions is a very common and effective way to get synthetic data for OCR.

2023-04-29 18:08:57,Hey
2023-04-29 18:09:00,Will not be able to make it.
2023-04-29 18:58:01,Will you be recording this?
2023-04-29 19:22:25,Weekend fun!
2023-04-29 19:35:58,D-ID is crazy good. Any ideas on the underlying architecture?
2023-04-29 19:38:30,SadTalker is open and it getting there. Some friends are working on a project and they moved on from D-ID for SadTalker. You will need a good GPU though.
2023-04-29 19:41:32,Not so sure but this tech is around since a while.
2023-04-29 19:42:03,Not zero shot lipsync / animation - that's hard and has limited work
2023-04-29 19:45:46,Sad talker is arguably better...
2023-04-29 19:48:40,D-ID is very expensive if you’re building a project with a pipeline to generate content on an enormous amount.
2023-04-29 19:50:23,How expensive?
2023-04-29 19:51:59,As mentioned on their Pricing page. 🤣
2023-04-29 19:52:33,Have you deployed and tested at scale?
2023-04-29 19:52:40,Unreasonably expensive for an api product
2023-04-29 19:52:47,We used multiple D-ID accounts to get this done :p
2023-04-29 19:53:42,They have a full fledged web studio as well.
2023-04-29 19:54:09,Yup exactly - I feel like the pricing is aligned for the dashboard only
2023-04-29 19:54:33,Right now SadTalker can generate 10min video per hour that’s 2$ GPU time
2023-04-29 19:57:46,"D-ID is charging 6$ per 10 mins. If you can have 3090 or 4090 at home, that would be like 300-400h gpu time to get your money back."
2023-04-29 20:00:12,May be get one with nvlinks for larger runs and still it’s a lot better return time for investment
2023-04-29 20:00:48,And yet has a lot of traction - good product to build.
2023-04-29 20:01:05,Any idea on what models they use?
2023-04-29 20:01:39,🤷‍♂️ their own. SadTalker is new and evolving. From tencent I think.
2023-04-29 20:09:11,"So many things to build, so many industries to disrupt. "
2023-04-29 20:14:31,Just ran it - seeing that its running gfpgan at the end too - so this time can definitely be reduced
2023-04-29 20:17:08,👍 
2023-04-29 20:29:39,Only notes (as of now)
2023-04-29 20:35:59,Yes and 2$ can be brought down if doing at scale (Assuming A100)
2023-04-29 20:36:27,Margins are great for this - and competition is less. (text to talking head avatars vs rephrase ai etc). Good product to build.
2023-04-29 20:36:40,I'll take a stab at building an mvp soon
2023-04-29 20:37:02,"Tried doing this back in 2019 and almost raised funding, but didn't work out"
2023-04-29 20:37:10,Not sure how big is the market for this though.
2023-04-29 20:37:41,It's an evolving market. Also look at leading indicators
2023-04-29 20:38:16,Wow this is very real
2023-04-29 20:38:57,"I've built this product as both an API, and also earlier (2020) as a charcater.ai type offering, and even tried to sell as nfts. "
2023-04-29 20:39:07,Hillarious stuff man
2023-04-29 20:39:14,I know how to do that :)
2023-04-29 20:39:26,That's the easy bit
2023-04-29 20:39:26,Don’t you want 8 AI avatars on Arnab’s show with different personalities?
2023-04-29 20:39:33,*Shakes hands*
2023-04-29 20:39:44,Thank you! [PHONE REMOVED] spent lot of time in generating the voices!
2023-04-29 20:39:52,Haha. We should jam.
2023-04-29 20:44:23,"If human can generate similar kind of content, I don’t think pureplay AI will sell. Human generated content is already limitless."
2023-04-29 20:45:21,It was just a joke. But AI fact checking anchor in every debate can be a nice start.
2023-04-29 20:45:46,Thinking XYZ movie in Nolan style. Or personalized standup making references about my own personal life - that might really work.
2023-04-29 20:46:16,"Also if anyone else wants to jam with [PHONE REMOVED] and me, and even potentially collaborate on building this - hit me up. "
2023-04-29 20:46:30,There will be a popup after every statement then 😅😅
2023-04-29 21:12:27,Interested. Would like to offer something like this to creators on Koo.
2023-04-29 21:14:01,Also interested. Particularly interested in the AI Vocalist use case.
2023-04-29 21:14:26,Please do keep me posted on the jam
2023-04-29 21:15:12,"Also interested in the jam in a literal sense, as I’d be happy to beta test to create viral content"
2023-04-29 21:18:38,Sure will make a group
2023-04-29 21:29:36,Any opensource alternative to elevenlabs?
2023-04-29 21:29:52,bark
2023-04-29 21:29:59,Anyone came across any examples/tutorials for QnA over CSVs which uses Python code or maybe some good way to answer queries?
2023-04-29 21:34:51,Text to sql kind of thing ? And then sql can be run on data or direct qna on csv data?
2023-04-29 21:35:02,Thanks! Checking.

2023-04-29 23:27:13,The analysis part might be outsource-able to thoughtspot

2023-04-30 10:42:03,basic project idea:
2023-04-30 10:42:10,shortcuts are super useful if you know what you're doing
2023-04-30 10:42:25,Most people don't use them to their full potential since the documentation is so messy
2023-04-30 10:43:33,"Can be a vague, small step towards AGI for the common-man."
2023-04-30 10:44:13,"Would love to get a functionality like : ""Create shortcuts to automatically change my wallpaper based on 7 images, 1 for each day of the week"""
2023-04-30 10:44:37,One of my friends set up something like that and it took him 2 full hours to get his head around it
2023-04-30 10:54:17,And even generating a step by step guide to make a shortcut should be plenty for people like me
2023-04-30 10:58:00,"Any best resources for creating charts/graphs from data, open-source ""Chart-GPT"" resources especially python based would be great. Have tried chartgpt(dot)dev, looking for alternatives."
2023-04-30 11:30:56,Got it. Any open source solution which you know?
2023-04-30 11:34:02,are you looking to fine-tune or perform RLHF?
2023-04-30 11:34:16,RLHF on an open-source model*
2023-04-30 11:39:40,Majorly for RLHF.
2023-04-30 11:41:51,"So, for the first case, let’s say"
2023-04-30 13:29:47,"Hey , "
2023-04-30 13:35:25,Contextual is the way to go. Tracing will allow for this. Working on it now

2023-04-30 14:28:07,"Add more RAM to your REPL with a boost. Repl on Replit might've very limited RAM, they're like 2007 PCs in terms of specs."
2023-04-30 14:39:34,Any other alternative you suggest?  Let me try to increase the ram and see?
2023-04-30 14:41:55,How do I read this - how’s the recall measured?
2023-04-30 14:45:57,Those details are the same as here: https://ann-benchmarks.com

2023-04-30 14:48:10,Langchain has a drive connector fwik. You could use that to then do search with it's helper functions

2023-05-01 12:01:04,Perhaps a weekly post with all open roles can work better instead of a separate WA group? That makes it easier for all seekers to discover open roles also. 
2023-05-01 12:01:10,The challenge is that posting on LinkedIn has been ineffective for specific areas and GenAI has very few communities.

2023-05-02 10:19:50,I would have loved to plug Langchain here if they had absolutely anything which worked
2023-05-02 10:20:40,Could you please elaborate? Trying this out. Any shortcomings that we need to be aware of?

2023-05-02 10:22:48,Is this not working for you?
2023-05-02 10:23:05,Random shortcoming from the last 24 hours alone which I've seen:
2023-05-02 10:25:03,"For a lot of _common_ use cases (outside of agents), it's perhaps better to roll your own then to use Langchain — and I say this as the resident Langchain fanboi of this group"
2023-05-02 10:25:12,What if there are a lot of messages? Exceed 4096 tokens.
2023-05-02 10:25:42,Make an extra API call and ask the model which messages are worth keeping up
2023-05-02 10:26:36,Give an Example?

2023-05-02 10:47:25,thanks!
2023-05-02 11:47:53,1) Does it make sense to use something else like llamaindex now. Anyone who has experience using both of them?
2023-05-02 11:48:40,There was a person from luma labs here no? 🤔
2023-05-02 11:48:40,A friend has used llamaindex for chat conversations and was satisfied

2023-05-02 11:52:30,[PHONE REMOVED] for chat convos how has your experience been with llamaindex?
2023-05-02 11:52:41,I know you use both langchain and llama
2023-05-02 11:53:14,Yeah I started of with gpt index but moved to langchain
2023-05-02 11:53:27,Actually I wanted to create custom tools
2023-05-02 11:53:59,My team's working on semantic search to feed in product content to LLMs. Anyone here has worked on Lucene based ANNs with OpenSearch 2.x ?
2023-05-02 11:54:05,"For these use cases, Langchain is still very good"
2023-05-02 11:54:59,Why Lucene/OpenSearch? Have a requirement which prevents you from using a decent VectorDB or Elastic itself?
2023-05-02 11:55:52,For storing chat history isn't llama better? Thought you had some points on this
2023-05-02 11:56:38,I have
2023-05-02 11:56:41,It gets the job done
2023-05-02 11:57:02,Those are also options being evaluated but there are company level constraints on them.
2023-05-02 11:57:21,[PHONE REMOVED] any input on the 2nd question?
2023-05-02 11:57:24,"Thanks, I will DM you."
2023-05-02 12:12:50,This is my biggest worry of using LangChain in production env. This is a very active repo lot of PRs being merged but still don't see much quality checks around it (unit and integration tests). Like Haystack and even some part of Transformers repo has which I feel should be required for any production quality codebase.
2023-05-02 12:15:04,"It's not just about backward compatibility. It's also about clarity on what they want to do — Langchain seems to be prioritising agents, tools and toolchain around that over everything else"
2023-05-02 12:31:11,"True we wrote own in js stuff moved away from langchain , will open source soon once we have most basic func"
2023-05-02 12:36:03,Question was around data connectors and indexing: 
2023-05-02 12:49:08,Does deforum have a commercial license?
2023-05-02 13:14:04,interesting - I've been using https://deeplearn.org/ for this
2023-05-02 13:24:14,Has anybody tried Semantic Kernel? Do you see this as langchain alternative? 
2023-05-02 13:38:46,"I don't see it as a Langchain alternative yet (doesn't care about agents, data indexing, tools at all) — but for the few things it does, it does have a cleaner API. I am planning to try it out if a project comes along"
2023-05-02 13:41:59,"Hmm, you're right. I could see Semantic Kernel adding tools, agents as capabilities with a clean-ish API in the short term."
2023-05-02 13:50:05,"But it'd be quite ironical if $MSFT has better API design than a well-funded, immensely popular FOSS project to be honest 🥲"
2023-05-02 13:50:52,yea! heard they raised another round already (not sure about the source though)
2023-05-02 13:54:11,Why though?
2023-05-02 13:54:37,I frankly don’t see any llm abstraction library really working out in the near term. Its like writing a C compiler for a changing chip design and Instruction set before x86
2023-05-02 13:54:47,API design has little to do with community traction I'd believe
2023-05-02 13:55:03,"Say more, I don't understand you"
2023-05-02 13:55:16,"Fun analogy, but the x86 is GPT4 no?"
2023-05-02 13:55:35,"Gpt is the processor, instruction set is the prompts"

2023-05-02 14:03:15,"Don't use langchain, absolute shit show at scale. Memory is essentially a list of chat messages, In our system, we save it in redis as a single serialised string, retrieved and constructed at run time. I've also implemented a moving window approach to summarise chat history to save on tokens. Happy to discuss more."

2023-05-02 14:08:49,maybe do dynamic rolling window for every question? Store all messages but only pass the ones relevant to the current questio
2023-05-02 14:09:20,What about summarisation? We’ve tried calling the openai summarisation API to summarise the prev chat but it’s slow af
2023-05-02 14:10:13,We need some inside info on how chatgpt is doing this 🫣
2023-05-02 14:10:34,OpenAI has a summarisation API? Didn't they deprecate that?
2023-05-02 14:11:33,"Prompt engineering helps there. Think of your usecases as bucketed modules. Don't use a one size fits all prompt, but smartly create prompts that can preserve needed info. Has been working well for our usecases"
2023-05-02 14:11:40,"Openai once suggested to us in 2020 to use a smaller and faster model for summarisation here, wonder how well that works"
2023-05-02 14:12:03,"It's a trade off, experience vs expense. Have to take that call based on your product."
2023-05-02 14:12:34,"use gpt-3.5 only, prompt it well, keep temp low."

2023-05-03 18:54:47,That’s true for multiple mediums. People who understand cameras really well can describe various aspects of the image in precise instructions. Similarly I have seen experienced writers perform much better in my workshops while using chatgpt.

2023-05-04 12:04:43,Thank you ; reduced further still no luck
2023-05-04 12:06:53,+1 have the same question about vector dbs
2023-05-04 12:12:45,"I have used Faiss and Milvus (via Haystack) for personal projects very long time ago. Used to create create separate collections for different type of datas. As that time filters were not common in these vector dbs. Now like to understand is there other better way, ideally separating storage from query layer."
2023-05-04 12:26:11,"Yes, separate collections is perhaps the cleanest way? "
2023-05-04 12:37:56,"For folks interested in Generative Art, cool results from inpainting and other SD tricks there: https://chat.whatsapp.com/GThJJhoF3cL7QCmrfIoY8J"

2023-05-04 12:57:12,Thanks for the shout-out Nirant 🙏🏻😊
2023-05-04 12:58:39,I have done this. 
2023-05-04 13:00:30,"What level of multi tenancy do you require? Separate collection is the easiest way, but you can go for a sharded approach, if you need horizontal scale"
2023-05-04 13:17:12,"Hi everyone, "
2023-05-04 13:17:50,Average out the embeddings for the document
2023-05-04 13:18:24,Are you predicting related keywords for a given text and then clustering somehow ?
2023-05-04 13:19:38,"For most prompts it's usually semantic keyword matching, in some scenarios there can be some logic involved"
2023-05-04 13:20:01,"Shyam, a few details which will help us answer your question better: "
2023-05-04 13:20:45,Could you describe your approach ?
2023-05-04 13:20:46,"Example, if the user is prompting 'x of 10%', but the data point has the absolute value of that variable, then some logic will be needed."
2023-05-04 13:22:02,"We don't implement the matching, because the prompts are varied as I mentioned, we are directly feeding the data and prompt to gpt-3"
2023-05-04 13:23:42,Is there a reason for using text-davinci-003 and NOT gpt3.5-turbo?
2023-05-04 13:24:56,"1. No, just the GPT-3 endpoint."
2023-05-04 13:26:24,"No reason, have to try gpt-3.5-turbo and compare results"

2023-05-04 13:32:58,Has anybody used langchain or llama index for hybrid embeddings? I was looking through their code to find what they use for sparse embeddings. Llama seems to use BERT and langchain I couldn’t find
2023-05-04 13:33:21,The error was the Vectors were not inserted properly. The correct code [ highly simplified is here]
2023-05-04 13:33:24,with client.batch as batch:
2023-05-04 13:33:49,Vector =  < Place your VECTOR embeddings here>
2023-05-04 13:34:43,"Llama Index has extensible Retrievers, so shouldn't matter either way no?"
2023-05-04 13:34:55,Thanks to  Soumendra @+91 74980 76111  for trying yo help me
2023-05-04 13:36:16,Thank you for your interest. I used simple Python and Weavite librarues
2023-05-04 13:37:18,Thanks Sharding is another good way.
2023-05-04 13:37:47,Ah got it. So BERT was just an example
2023-05-04 13:37:59,Found haystack to be great btw. the code is same for embedding insert and retrieval independent of the vector store you use.
2023-05-04 13:38:18,cc [PHONE REMOVED] was a Haystack contributor :)
2023-05-04 13:38:35,"Yeah, Llama Index has decent Retriever design. Some Custom examples: https://github.com/jerryjliu/llama_index/blob/main/examples/query/CustomRetrievers.ipynb"
2023-05-04 13:47:04,"I always had this question, deepset haystack was doing the semantic search pipelines for so long, why langchain became so viral as if some novelty?"
2023-05-04 13:47:55,"Ease of use, right place at right time, became viral too fast before people even knew about alternatives"
2023-05-04 13:48:34,Once the GitHub stars started picking up everyone's eyes were on it.
2023-05-04 13:48:36,Haystack is much better in code quality and documentation imo.
2023-05-04 13:51:04,"Chatgpt helped as well, probably they rode that wave, may be haystack didn't treat chatgpt as urgent requirement"
2023-05-04 13:52:25,"Langchain is not about semantic search, it's about QA, Tools and Agents. In fact, there is no search API in Langchain."
2023-05-04 13:53:11,I mean there is overlap between both
2023-05-04 14:03:58,indexes feels like semantic search interface - https://python.langchain.com/en/latest/modules/indexes/getting_started.html
2023-05-04 14:15:38,"Thanks, this discussion helped understanding strengths of langchain and/vs haystack"
2023-05-04 14:27:03,"yeah, just discovered this: https://docs.haystack.deepset.ai/docs/document_store because of the discussion here. I was thinking of creating a similar abstraction layer (i.e. provide a single API for vector DBs, allowing any VectorDB to be plugged in), but I might just depend on this now"
2023-05-04 14:29:16,True. Apart from code and documentation. Haystack is very good in design. Just check how haystack implemented PromptNode and compare it with Langchain. You will see the difference.
2023-05-04 14:31:46,"“ This approach is the most flexible, but creating numerous collections may result in resource overhead.  only recommended to separate users into multiple collections if you have a limited number of users “"
2023-05-04 14:32:59,"Agreed. And the vector store abstraction too. Granted it's not perfect, but flexible enough to mould it the way we want."
2023-05-04 14:34:06,100s should be pretty fine from what I've been told internally
2023-05-04 14:34:40,100x100 na
2023-05-04 14:37:51,"Go for sharded approach imo, cluster will take care of fault tolerance, shards will take care of horizontal scaling. It's easy to build."
2023-05-04 14:39:21,"fwiw, all FOSS Vector DBs offer cloud solutions so that you don't have to think about cluster sizing, managing servers, sharding and  problems like what [PHONE REMOVED] just mentioned"
2023-05-04 14:40:15,Build vs Buy 😄
2023-05-04 14:50:26,Vitess is a great tool.
2023-05-04 15:36:37,For folks wondering: https://vitess.io/ is a tool for sharding — and here is a good primer for what sharding means: https://aws.amazon.com/what-is/database-sharding/
2023-05-04 15:42:56,"Have y’all heard of Modular? Chris Lattner’s (authors of LLVM and Swift and programmer extraordinaire) startup that is trying to create a new AI programming language. Jeremy Howard is an adviser, and here he introduces the language. There are cases it is 3000x faster than equivalent Python code for matrix multiplication "
2023-05-04 15:45:10,https://planetscale.com/ does managed Vitess as well. We were exploring it at Razorpay.
2023-05-04 15:45:14,"Reminder: Programming language is called Mojo. It's not Free or Open Source. Given how Java shaped up, I'm wary of using anything without a community around it to maintain and at least do basic security fixes for 5-10 years."
2023-05-04 15:45:57,How did Razorpay end up doing sharding?
2023-05-04 15:46:28,Not being open source at launch was a weird choice...  Can't remember the last time a language launched like that...
2023-05-04 15:50:13,We didn't go ahead in the end. 😅
2023-05-04 16:04:03,Jeremy was a strong proponent of TF Swift as well. But that hasn't seen major adoption even inside G so ymmv

2023-05-04 16:20:29,This is using gpt4 as a judge having it rate llm outputs
2023-05-04 16:21:11,https://lmsys.org/blog/2023-03-30-vicuna/
2023-05-04 16:21:41,“According to a fun and non-scientific evaluation with GPT-4. Further rigorous evaluation is needed.”
2023-05-04 16:22:05,Exactly!
2023-05-04 16:22:13,Maybe we run openi evals on it :)
2023-05-04 16:24:14,This eval doesn't make any sense to me. Already LLMs capabilities to produce such ranks/marks are highly debated to it's stochastic nature. It's like a teacher that gives a different score each time when she evaluates  answer from a different room
2023-05-04 16:24:38,Yea... independent and good benchmarking of AI needs to be a thing...
2023-05-04 16:26:20,LLM evaluation is an open research question. We have some nlp eval methods like lm-eval-harness but need to improve from that.
2023-05-04 16:28:13,"just to add one more point, alpaca and vinuca are LLAMA derivatives so I don't think it can fit in that graph since they aren't new base LLMs. Also I don't think its good idea to train models on chatgpts output like Alpaca did, if you're curious about the reason:https://twitter.com/Shahules786/status/1650898925178720256"
2023-05-04 16:28:42,"Benchmarking has this weird dynamic of very useful for industry and their labs, but gives no glory to people who make them — so it doesn't attract hackers or academics. "
2023-05-04 16:29:33,Sure... at the research level some objective ones will help but also at the consumer and solutions level... We have a full tech gadget review industry... A similar AI review industry is needed...  This impacts everyone and everything now...

2023-05-04 16:42:40,"Most devs actually have the highest buying power in any organisation. If a developer says they need to pay 100$/mo to keep their database up, that’s a bottom line for a business"
2023-05-04 16:44:40,Devs are the end consumers

2023-05-04 16:48:24,"We should jam separately on this, very different problems and implications :)"
2023-05-04 16:48:35,"yeah. fastai was also going to build a tf swift version i think, but all those projects kinda got abandoned when Chris Lattner left Google."
2023-05-04 17:23:40,"Generative Pretraining is the default ""GPT"" training objective, I'll let you dig this up on your own. If you don't mind reading papers, the original Radford et al is still relevant for this. "
2023-05-04 17:28:15,"On a concept level I understand the difference, but while training it, is there a difference? I checked databricks dolly script - https://github.com/databrickslabs/dolly/blob/master/training/trainer.py"
2023-05-04 17:28:18,"For wider audience, the code interpreter is largely a Python REPL and a GPT4-fork finetuned on Python/code. This is not a separate feature or anything like that. "
2023-05-04 17:28:50,Difference in outcomes or syntax/code which we write?
2023-05-04 17:30:50,Syntax/code - essentially the training objective
2023-05-04 17:33:08,"Going out on a limb, but I'd like to think that they should be identical with different configs — finetuning and training objectives are often kept identical these days"
2023-05-04 17:35:48,Understood. So we are still doing next word prediction on instruction dataset. Then how does it learn when to stop?
2023-05-04 17:38:41,Yep. Code interpreter is quite useful.  Threw a csv I had at it and it saved me at least an hour in data clean up if not more...
2023-05-04 17:40:18,Chatgpt code interpreter and gpt-4 browsing models are more useful than I anticipated.
2023-05-04 17:40:39,Guessing — stop word markers in the instruction dataset?

2023-05-05 00:37:40,"Having tried all the models from Google, I fully agree they have no moat."
2023-05-05 00:41:22,You think OpenAI has no moat either?
2023-05-05 00:41:50,Community / dev side NFX is there
2023-05-05 00:43:11,Also early mover is a real advantage for them. All that gets built/is getting built right .. tough/lethargy to rewrite/rewire

2023-05-05 00:44:36,Network Effects
2023-05-05 00:44:38,Network effects 🙈
2023-05-05 00:45:58,"Of course not, which is why I pointedly talked only about Google 😀"
2023-05-05 00:48:45,"Opensource models are far behind OpenAI right now. They may be able to catch up, and I do think they'll reach gpt4 level performance eventually, but there's a good chance OpenAI will be able to maintain its lead for 2 to 5 years or more, and that amount of moat is usually enough."
2023-05-05 00:50:02,I don't think community/nfx is a moat here. Look at what happened to tensorflow.
2023-05-05 00:50:22,"I think even if open source becomes comparable or even more effective, the possibilities of building a business does exist. "
2023-05-05 00:54:38,OpenAI's moat comes from aligning with MSFT/Azure. Government and finance domains are essentially theirs for the taking.
2023-05-05 00:55:54,"And the pace at with they can onboard other businesses on plugins- like uber, expedia"
2023-05-05 00:57:02,"That will take a while to mature, finance sector is where they'll make the big bags for now"

2023-05-05 01:18:35,Perhaps works like Bloom could prove me wrong?
2023-05-05 01:27:49,"Another thing is that Microsoft+OpenAI can make inference costs so low that hosting other LLMs probably doesn't make sense unless compliance issue. Just like on-premise vs Cloud. While OSS models catch up on GPT4 quality, they are already working on inference optimization. Microsoft just announced today that they are investing in AMD to counter Nvidia GPU monopoly and also developing custom inference GPUs."

2023-05-05 12:40:45,got it thanks
2023-05-05 12:44:59,"The encoder takes in a sequence of input tokens, the decoder needs to generate/predict the output sequence. The decoder produces a probability distribution over the vocabulary of the language at each time step, conditioned on the previous tokens in the output sequence and the context vector. This probability distribution is then used to sample the next token in the sequence. "
2023-05-05 12:47:00,"as they both have separate rate limits, can we use gpt-3.5-turbo-0301 as fallback when gpt-3.5 limits are over?"
2023-05-05 12:49:00,"I think they've shared rate limits, but if they do separately -- yes"
2023-05-05 12:50:34,"Depends on many parts in the decoder, from nucleus sampling to beam search. But safe to say that it's not a decoder problem. "
2023-05-05 12:50:53,Does it work that way? Or rate limits are key based
2023-05-05 12:56:04,"so, in reality, could we control and fix the seeding of the model, so that it is guaranteed to generate the same output every time for a particular input (also, would temperature=0 do the same thing)?"
2023-05-05 13:00:38,Sure
2023-05-05 13:04:27,"Yes, but there is always some non determinism with GPUs."
2023-05-05 13:09:38,"In GPT, the randomness comes from the probability distribution over the vocabulary right? Is there a way we set top-k/top-p values though the chat interface?"

2023-05-06 12:14:52,These are the one's ive found quite useful:
2023-05-06 12:55:42,"New open source LLM, better than Llama, commercial use allowed"
2023-05-06 12:58:14,"""The 7B model is still training (at 800B tokens) and we see the training loss still decrease consistently. As a result, we will continue to train it to 1T tokens."" Fascinating that models will start to touch the trillion mark!"
2023-05-06 13:17:02,"No. There are two ways to make it deterministic (this is not including RLHF magic, any fine-tuning magic etc, don't know what all they have here) but both with different behaviours. One by setting temp=0, here you are forcing softmax to select the top word pick, so this degenerates to greedy though you are sampling. Thus will have issues being it taking the most frequent word combinations."
2023-05-06 13:18:08,"The other by setting seeds. This still allows you to 'actually'  generate using top-p/top-k. OpenAI does not let us to set the seed afaik. You can also play with combination of top-p and  temp for your particular problem to see when it is stable/deterministic, you don't need to always go to zero."
2023-05-06 13:19:45,Pro Tip for anyone trying to pursue this line of reasoning and looking for first hand experience: Take a GPT2 or BLOOM model and try to get consistent outputs — you'll develop a very good mental model of what it takes to get a deterministic output.

2023-05-06 14:17:30,Might have a better time just running clip interrogator and just asking gpt for a score from that genenrated caption
2023-05-06 14:22:47,"Hallucination and determinism (the above definition of it, same output for same input) are not that related. Hallucination is largely an after effect of model learning patterns that aren't true, in the weights so to speak. The determinism issue is largely a final layer problem (and may be fine-tuning layers). As in how you select from most  reasonable walk amongst series of words choices (you essentially have k-ary tree starting from first word). Another meaning of determinism could be whether it could generalize well (minor perturbation of input don't lead to change in output), this is very related to hallucination and both are related model weights."
2023-05-06 14:34:07,"I don't think this is doing human profile scoring per se 😀. It is trained on AVA, so doing scene scoring. So nice sunsets or bokeh images, highly saturated colors etc should get good rating."
2023-05-06 14:38:00,[PHONE REMOVED] sir would you like to explain AVA and image dataset curation methods/conventions — lot of folks here are not from Vision in particular
2023-05-06 14:40:40,It is pretty bad at scene scoring too unfortunately. Only the examples they've shared score well.
2023-05-06 14:51:57,"Sorry, my bad. This is for the problem of Visual Aesthetic Scoring that is given a set of pictures, score pictures from interesting to least (think flickr interestingness if you know what that was, like what photos you will want in your album or showcase your photography talent). There were bunch of datasets created for this, AVA was one of those, I think curated from DPChallenge with score and sematic tags for each image."
2023-05-06 14:55:18,it's ranked based on likes etc not from a specific person also each paper is has a short summary as well as why it's important basically designed for a daily quick scan

2023-05-06 15:07:13,"Any good library references to create datasets for LLMs? Say, training Vicuna/Dolly 7B/13B on a domain. I want to replicate what BloombergGPT did in finance but for a very specific bucket in finance. Also, any way to estimate infra cost for suchs training and hosting?"
2023-05-06 15:08:39,"Given a prompt, and a set of generations from the prompt, example, if the prompt is ""black and gold colour scheme, blue sky, white mountains, red house,... "" and 10 images are generated, is it possible to rank the generated images based on how well the prompt was followed?"
2023-05-06 15:11:17,"Additionally, given that there are numerous generations where there are small issues, for example, extra hand in one, incorrect tshirt representation in another, is it possible to auto build a workflow, which figures out where the image is incorrect , masks it, and sends through another generation to fix that area?  If so, what would be required for it to detect errors in the image?"
2023-05-06 15:12:29,Reply with: DM me 😂
2023-05-06 15:14:29,you can check out the stanford alpaca repository.  They explain the method that lets you create the dataset based on few hand written examples. That uses distilling datasets using LLM's from open AI. But if this is something that is going to be for commercial use you have to check the terms of service.
2023-05-06 15:19:34,Could be a growth hack as well
2023-05-06 15:23:49,"Are you a dev? Because you just pulled a ""It's a not a bug, it's a feature"" 😂"
2023-05-06 15:58:16,"No that is a different problem altogether. The above one is a very visual problem, doesn't depend on things like semantic meaning or the implications of those as much. So for example, it will rank the fanous Henry Cartier Bresson's Leap into unknown photo (this photo's context is Europe entering world war 2) poorly. The visual aesthetic problem to a decent degree is sort of solved. Many models are production use, where you can remove human time required. But this problem requires more understanding of real world (like humans have 2 hands etc). So training on that dataset probably won't work as well. I think [PHONE REMOVED] and others have worked on this more. They can chime in on what works."
2023-05-06 16:00:38,"I mean, large scale deployments are common for Visual Aesthetic scoring, where revenue numbers can be impacted if you do poorly."
2023-05-06 16:04:16,"Is it possible for a visual QA model to identify errors in a picture, if we use ""errors in the image"" as the question? Then use grounded SAM to auto-detect areas where the visual QA answered? And then use models which are finetuned on those datasets to fix those imperfections?"
2023-05-06 16:05:13,"I am asking more from a workflow, rather than one model doing it all. It would be difficult to make it work using a single model."

2023-05-06 16:23:46,"a naive idea that comes to my mind, is divide the images into multiscale patches, embed with CLIP and then check similarity with the prompt."
