[2023-05-13, 21:12:35] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Has anyone watched Dr.Who ? 
One of my favourite episodes is Vincent and the Doctor 

There’s this very lovely line from that episode 

“Pain is easy to portray, but to use your passion and pain to portray the ecstasy and joy and magnificence of our world, no one had ever done it before. Perhaps no one ever will again. To my mind, that strange, wild man who roamed the fields of Provence was not only the world's greatest artist, but also one of the greatest men who ever lived.”
[2023-05-13, 21:13:32] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Some days back there was a debate in the Deepmedia channel about using artist’s style for visual prompting 


Which led to someone saying this 
“(it’s the same)Whether putting paint on paper, or typing in a prompt in the tool…)
[2023-05-13, 21:14:39] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Not that it’s wrong ,it actually raises good questions 


Does anyone think we can have similar emotions evoked for an artist if he’s using generative AI ?
[2023-05-13, 21:28:04] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: I was thinking of exactly this! 
Someone entered this in Colorado State fair digital painting competition and it created quite a controversy on its own on SM
[2023-05-13, 21:30:05] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Many artists are saying something similar ,have come across so many people saying this exact same thing that AI art has no soul ,there is no effort from artist
[2023-05-13, 21:30:55] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Which begs another question

Is AI a tool for art like chalk,crayon,paintbrush? Or is it not ?
[2023-05-13, 21:33:31] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Hmm I feel the opposite 
Artists will become more valued
[2023-05-13, 21:33:52] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: AI art will be a commodity and more cheaply available
[2023-05-13, 21:34:21] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Art which was made by an experienced professional with their own hard work will become more valuable
[2023-05-13, 21:35:19] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Leather goods are dime a dozen
Special handcrafted leather goods are luxury 

Suits are available at all price ranges
Bespoke suits are very rare
[2023-05-13, 21:42:41] ~ Arvind Sankar: You could argue there are some jobs where art is already commoditized. Graphic designers, cartoonists, poster markers, people who make marketing material, etc. AI art may replace such jobs as there is more emphasis on quantity than conveying any thought provoking/pholosophical idea. Opposition form this end is not surprising as this is something that is likely to affect their livelihood.

Meanwhile, there will always be artists who do it to convey their emotions or provide a commentary on an issue. For them, generative AI would be tools create their art
[2023-05-13, 21:47:48] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Agreed ,these jobs are more threatened by AI , and these are also more commercialised in nature.
[2023-05-13, 21:48:25] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Carving David took 3 years but painting Starry Nights took few days.
[2023-05-13, 21:49:29] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Painting starry night took It 100+ paintings I believe:)
[2023-05-13, 21:50:01] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: GenAI Artist May get lucky but best one have used 1000 prompts before ending with a great AI art
[2023-05-13, 21:50:12] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: But yes,time is not measure of effort any longer
[2023-05-13, 21:50:58] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Your thousands attempt to get to the prompt has the soul of what you’re trying to achieve
[2023-05-13, 21:51:15] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Speed is due to human ingenuity and tech advancement
[2023-05-13, 21:51:47] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: The sculptures debated same thing about pairings
[2023-05-13, 21:52:28] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: But pairing gave access of art to many folks who couldn’t afford a block of granite
[2023-05-13, 21:52:36] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: *Paintings*
[2023-05-13, 21:53:05] ~ Pranav: https://instagram.com/kunelgaur

take this guy's art for example- isn't going to be replaced any time soon. it's something that's genuinely amazing and would only be valued more.
[2023-05-13, 21:53:54] Aankit Roy Khabri YC: ‎Aankit Roy Khabri YC joined from the community
[2023-05-13, 21:54:20] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Yes it would definitely be so
[2023-05-13, 21:56:14] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Yup if we view AI like a tool 
It seems like a natural order of progression for art tools
[2023-05-13, 21:56:27] ~ Pranav: i feel strongly about AI art for the same reason- access. It gives expression to so many folks who can't draw. just like the camera ushered in way of expressing through photography- so is generative art. 

 *It's democratizing art.*
[2023-05-13, 21:56:30] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: But then is it really a tool is something everyone is debating
[2023-05-13, 21:57:38] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Art itself is a tool, a tool of expression
[2023-05-13, 21:59:00] ~ Pranav: Wouldn't say its a tool- can't say it's doing everything- it's somewhat in between imo. Because when you're using brushes, pencils or even a camera to create art, you are visualising something and trying to recreate that exact visualisation. But here the model is visualising it for you ( what you are thinking of isn't the same as what the model's thinking of in a sense?)
[2023-05-13, 22:02:38] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Exactly! This tool definition is also a definition I’m struggling with ,and the last part is the exact problem which has everyone up in arms

Because let’s say I prompt a boat by the sea
Model can give me 10 different output 
Because my capability to visualise is mediocre/non existent I’ll happily choose the best output and claim that work as outcome of my effort 

I’ll further refine prompts to get something additionally /remove something 

But am I really creating up the art then ?
[2023-05-13, 22:02:53] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Just playing the devil’s advocate:)
[2023-05-13, 22:03:15] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Did that art really originate with me?
[2023-05-13, 22:03:45] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: you have superior tools than chisel and a paintbrush
[2023-05-13, 22:05:05] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Even I have access of all SDs and ControlNets, I can’t create any of the good image because I really don’t have an artists eyes or taste.
[2023-05-13, 22:05:24] ~ Arvind Sankar: If you prompt "social commentary on addiction", it may not give as good a result when compared to "a guy drinking alcohol where a fishing rope extends from the bottom of the bottle with a hook on the other end"

In this example, I am not outsourcing thinking/visualizing art, but only outsourcing how the thought will be actualized
[2023-05-13, 22:15:46] ~ Arvind Sankar: Composers of music or producers of movies usually get the copyright of the works, and not the musicians or actors themselves as they are the ones who stitch everything up.

In paintings, you could argue how detailed the instructions are. If I commission a work by **only** saying "make a poster for my musical album", my contribution is very little. Meanwhile, if I specify that the album cover should include collage of many well known personality (in reference to Sgt peppers), my contributions increases to the point to deserve copyright
[2023-05-13, 22:16:50] ~ Arvind Sankar: Similar to mangas where authors are usually different from illustrators. Different mangas will list illustrators and authors separately based on the contribution invloved
[2023-05-13, 22:17:26] Nirant K: I am a simple man, I see manga I tag @917407651462
[2023-05-13, 22:20:26] Jay Pokarna 2014 BPCC: I personally think of AI as a tool which enables people to do art. And on the topic of AI Art not having a soul, when photography was coming up, a lot of painters etc had the same view of photography. But we do think of photography today as an art form in itself. So I think with time, this opinion also might change that AI art form has no soul.
[2023-05-13, 22:21:38] ~ Arvind Sankar: I mentioned a copyright case as well on this matter
[2023-05-13, 22:22:43] ~ Arvind Sankar: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrow-Giles_Lithographic_Co._v._Sarony
[2023-05-13, 22:24:53] ~ Arvind Sankar: BTW, to introduce myself I am a patent lawyer (with a degree in DS) looking to form connections and work on legaltech.
[2023-05-13, 22:56:55] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: But couldn't one argue that definition of this 'stitcher' may evolve over time? (as would have happened even at the time of this Burrow-Giles v. Sarony lawsuit) And as with all things AI, why can't attribution/legal ownership also be fuzzy? 

Maybe people will eventually come up with models to estimate originality component etc. So, a GenAI painting could be rated as x% original / y% Jackson Pollock / z% Picasso / (100-x-y-z)% other etc. etc. (See Guilford model & Taxonomy model for high level definitions of originality & related creativity concepts: http://www.senseandsensation.com/2012/03/assessing-creativity.html )
[2023-05-13, 22:57:19] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: I think that as of now, the concept of AI generated art is somewhat similar to ghostwriting with the ghostwriter (i.e. artists or legal owners/custodians of reference art pieces) not having any realistic way of gaining from the process, and hence the various lawsuits trickling in. Thoughts?
[2023-05-13, 23:09:27] ~ Kruti: +1 on this. I met one of the  popular contemporary artist in India:  https://instagram.com/shiloshivsuleman - She had her latest work exhibits at India Art Fair happens in Delhi every year - she had a few samples of GenAI trained on her art work style on display along with her original art - i think she has them up on her insta page! She  thinks about AI as a tool - it's nothing more than an extension of her work.
[2023-05-13, 23:13:55] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: This is actually a case where AI is being used as a tool ,because the artist is referencing and reinforcing from her own set of works
[2023-05-13, 23:16:33] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: There was a similar debate in other group because the following style of prompts were being discussed 
“ scene description ,artist name artist style “
[2023-05-13, 23:19:29] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Where people were using multiple artist styles as part of prompt to make visually similar art ,
Now these aren’t well known deceases artists but they were artists whose works were used for training the AI
[2023-05-13, 23:19:40] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: *deceased
[2023-05-13, 23:20:02] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: They might possibly not know about how and when their arts were used
[2023-05-13, 23:22:40] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: If I prompt mid journey 
“Man in a forest under a tree in style of shilo shiv suleiman,black canvas”

And it gives me a painting which looks exactly like that artist,but they had never made it before.

Can I claim that the art is my creative ?

We are first institutional investors in Startups like Inshorts, Medibuddy, LetsTransport, Medikabazaar, Eggoz etc.  Invest primarily at Seed stage with check size of $200K-$1.5M.
[2023-05-14, 04:26:15] Brij Singh Rebright Partners: My interest is understanding how various forms of art will evolve, because of and with AI. Recently I wrote this on Twitter - While there is a lot of concern how Generative AI  Models will affect artists and influence art negatively, Im actually excited about new possibilities. 

Just like how Picasso tried to reinvent 2D paintings, Human artists could expand their horizons on 3D art in ways that hasn’t happened since the Middle Ages.  LLMs might be good at digital art and photography, but even if we connect them to 3D printer, they will hit limitations at atoms.  

We could be entering a whole new universe of artistic revolutions!
[2023-05-14, 07:50:59] Hasan Tech Art: I have been working as an artist for the last 5 years using code, robotics and AI as my medium. Also have been thinking in the similar direction. I have written a few principles of change for the next decade that I use for my workshops with artist. Would love to have a conversation sometime on this.
[2023-05-14, 07:52:14] Brij Singh Rebright Partners: Thats great to hear Hasan and would love to chat, where are you based? Im based in Bangalore but travel a lot of other parts of the country / world
[2023-05-14, 07:54:26] Hasan Tech Art: Sweet. I’m based in Goa.
[2023-05-14, 07:55:38] Brij Singh Rebright Partners: Ah nice .. may we can get on a brief call and exchange what each other is working on?  I'm building a Studio for Gen AI Projects / Innovations that you would find interesting
[2023-05-14, 08:15:21] Hasan Tech Art: That sounds great. Sending you a message. ✨
[2023-05-14, 08:38:04] ~ Arvind Sankar: But the goal should be to make it as objective as possible, if it has to serve some practical utility. In law for instance, if a standard is left subjective, there will never be an end to litigation.

Having said this, the rule is fuzzy.
In copyrights, the standard for whether a work is copyrightable differs from country to country. At some countries work is copyrightable if it is "novel " or has been expressed for the first time. Other countries require "a modicum of creativity" for a work to be copyrightable.
In patents, aside from the invention not being published in any other country, it should also have "inventive step". This means that it should not be obvious to a person skilled in the art. How the examiner at the office assess whether it will obvious to a person with ordinary skill in the art, in my opinion, brings subjectivity into play.

As far as  reference to "stitchers", I meant it in the sense that composers and producers are the ones who take each section of music or recorded scenes and envision which should go after the other. How the transitions should be etc. With paintings or books, if two or more people are involved, obviously they become coowners

[2023-05-14, 12:03:33] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: I agree, and was kind of pointing towards the same thing. Just the way an assessor is the final authority to remove that subjectivity under a set of stipulated rules (say, for allocating copyright within a country), eventually there can be ways to assess for the degree of ‘stitching’ one did.

Gets especially easy when input prompts are available, but there can surely be models that do that on their own even when only the final creative is availble. Even factors like location & type/strength of legal claim could  be among the assessment parameters.

[2023-05-16, 11:06:58] Swastik Banerjee: There is this book:
[2023-05-16, 11:07:26] Hasan Tech Art: I think books are always a step behind when it comes to capturing what is happening today specially in technology. one interesting book would be "The Age of Spiritual Machines" by Ray Kurzweil. 
Also if you have not read thinking fast and slow and A Mathematical Theory of Communication. I feel like there is a whole book worth writing about the connections between these two books.

[2023-05-16, 11:12:05] Nirant K: Just to reiterate for the wider audience: Thinking Fast and Slow, the Nobel Prize winning ideas have since been debunked in sincere science and the author Kahneman has since then (kinda) apologised for exaggerated claims.
[2023-05-16, 11:13:08] Divya Tak: Can you share sources?

Those were entirely bogus claims which have been since debunked by many others
[2023-05-16, 11:15:54] Divya Tak: I recall him saying that some of the research has since been disproven in a podcast interview
[2023-05-16, 11:16:04] Hasan Tech Art: "A Mathematical Theory of Communication" is an article by mathematician Claude E. Shannon published in Bell System Technical Journal in 1948.It was renamed The Mathematical Theory of Communication in the 1949 book of the same name,[5] a small but significant title change after realizing the generality of this work. It became one of the most cited scientific articles and gave rise to the field of information theory.

Book by Dr. Joost Meerloo from 1956, Talks about The Psychology of Thought Control, Menticide, and Brainwashing. There have been no studies that i am aware off which measures the brainwashing capabilities of LLMs on humans if weaponised. This is a more urgent danger in my opinion then super intelligence.
[2023-05-16, 12:04:53] Divya Tak: Ah so kahnman's work on priming is the flawed part?
[2023-05-16, 12:30:17] Vamshi: Merlin Donald’s “Origins of the modern mind” is a refreshing take even today.

I found his vocabulary very helpful in discussions. The manner in which he delineates the mimetic, the mythic and the theoretic is nuanced in all the right ways.
[2023-05-16, 12:31:30] Vamshi: I’ve found the smartest people tripping over the chasm between intelligence and consciousness because it’s the place very the difference between truth and logic becomes a material difference.
[2023-05-16, 12:32:49] Vamshi: *where
[2023-05-16, 12:33:57] Vamshi: https://www.google.co.in/books/edition/Origins_of_the_Modern_Mind/4Sk4vWkrUAgC?hl=en&gbpv=0

[2023-05-16, 18:31:59] Dr. Ashith Generative AI WA Group: So interesting
[2023-05-17, 01:09:30] Vamshi: The very interesting connect for me are the recurrent cultural patterns that persist with paradigm shifts in technology
[2023-05-17, 01:10:20] Vamshi: It seems to indicate that what we call culture and the human aspect is completely orthogonal to science and technology (this is now literally linear algebra 😄)
[2023-05-17, 01:10:36] Vamshi: *is
[2023-05-17, 01:11:12] Vamshi: A bit of is and a bit of are I guess 😄
[2023-05-17, 01:11:51] Divya Tak: Hmmm how so?
[2023-05-17, 01:12:01] Divya Tak: Culture responds to technology. And technology responds to culture
[2023-05-17, 01:12:02] Vamshi: This shows up even in sci-fi  narrative where the same cultural patterns persist even with mastery of the forces of nature
[2023-05-17, 01:12:37] Vamshi: Star Wars eventually regresses into some kind of Mahabharata 🤷‍♂️
[2023-05-17, 01:13:40] Divya Tak: I mean... If you go super reductive then sure. That's like saying all language is for communication so it's all the same. A lot of culture is about the nuances of things.
[2023-05-17, 01:13:55] Vamshi: We are in an age where scientific thinking is very optimistic about super intelligence, which we unable to really distinguish, epistemologically speaking, from super consciousness
[2023-05-17, 01:14:29] Vamshi: No no, I’m implying the very opposite of reductionism
[2023-05-17, 01:14:48] Vamshi: I’m saying that super intelligence will remind us of what we’re missing
[2023-05-17, 01:15:32] Vamshi: I mean obviously I’m indulging in super optimism at this point because I’m hoping this group is a bit ok with grandiose things
[2023-05-17, 01:16:39] Vamshi: That super intelligence will make it painfully obvious that it isn’t super conscious, unless it fundamentally integrates with the same mechanisms as life
[2023-05-17, 01:16:44] Vamshi: No oil and water
[2023-05-17, 01:17:01] Vamshi: The promised cybernetic union
[2023-05-17, 01:17:42] Dev Aggarwal: On the other side here - super intelligence will remind us all what it means to be human and how incredibly nuanced the human brain is, even if its inferior in terms of raw compute
[2023-05-17, 01:18:29] Vamshi: Yes exactly, I guess the wording can be interpreted as the opposite too, but I’m saying that the human aspect is going to be highlighted
[2023-05-17, 01:18:39] Vamshi: So in agreement 🙂
[2023-05-17, 01:19:47] Vamshi: Also I use orthogonal in the linear algebra sense, not in the other sense of “opposite”
[2023-05-17, 01:20:00] Vamshi: Orthogonal as in adding depth
[2023-05-17, 01:24:11] Vamshi: It’s super fun to find this group, the last quirky group I enjoyed was during the pandemic, where there was an international reading group of Finnegans Wake
[2023-05-17, 01:24:20] Vamshi: Truly fresh
[2023-05-17, 01:24:57] Vamshi: I haven’t tried anything on those lines with any chatbot, not sure why
[2023-05-17, 01:25:13] Vamshi: Then again there’s no sense to make of nonsense
[2023-05-17, 01:25:47] Vamshi: But Finnegans Wake is supposed to be inspired by subconscious symbolism
[2023-05-17, 01:26:55] Vamshi: I wonder if the llms will discover the hidden psychic archetypes in the phonetic collage technique that the work uses to create that strange symphony that’s between language and sound
[2023-05-17, 01:27:50] Sidhant Sequoia: If there’s 1 thing I’d pay to know…how are the w&b in GPT4 related to the number 42 😄
[2023-05-17, 01:28:03] Vamshi: Hahaha
[2023-05-17, 01:28:46] Vamshi: Over and out, will reserve the rest of the esoterica for the post-meet-up cinq à sept.

[2023-05-18, 03:05:18] Gokul Krishnan: That's true. But the general discourse including Sama etc went from "be kind o masters of AGI" to "be gone, capitalist pigs" quite fast and that was hilarious

[2023-05-18, 15:36:42] Micheil: And this seems to be a trend right now. OpenAI's CEO seemed to suggest something similar just yesterday. But I do wonder if all this 'fear mongering' isn't also a way to start developing/selling/financing tools that will help 'us' all be protected from AI.
[2023-05-18, 15:37:15] Micheil: Oh hear, yes, see my earlier comment. What would be the point of all this if there wasn't money to be made?

[2023-05-19, 12:10:53] Vamshi: Or just art, as it has to stand out as being un-automate-able above all that’s already been automated
[2023-05-19, 12:13:29] Vamshi: Hacking is the prototypical art form, which serves to serve as an instance of subversion of the automation with minimal

[2023-05-20, 03:22:16] ~ Tarun Raheja: what does this mean btw?
[2023-05-20, 11:10:29] Vamshi: I meant in the sense of those pictures where you can see something else in the background when you realise that the background can be interchanged with the foreground
[2023-05-20, 11:11:02] Vamshi: The formal axiomatic system is the “foreground” - all logical thinking on which math is built
[2023-05-20, 11:11:57] Vamshi: But the agency which builds this entire system, human consciousness, can only focus on the foreground while it builds this abstraction .
[2023-05-20, 11:13:45] Vamshi: But we intuitively have an idea of the background. And Gödel formalised the idea that the “background” not only exists, but has mathematical implications on the foreground
[2023-05-20, 11:14:25] Vamshi: The limits of the foreground
[2023-05-20, 11:17:11] Vamshi: So the metaphor was to invert the foreground of formal axiomatic thought. 

Modelling leads to models of ever increasing sophistication, which appear to mimetically stand in for the whole picture, when they’re only the foreground, no matter how sophisticated they are.
[2023-05-20, 11:22:49] Dev Aggarwal: Is this also somewhat related to extension vs intension? As in they get a set of small odd numbers right (extension) but haven’t built up the logic to really recognize any odd number (intension)
[2023-05-20, 11:53:04] Vamshi: Haha, yes I guess you mean the idea of “oddness”, in its entirety ?
[2023-05-20, 11:53:45] Dev Aggarwal: Yes
[2023-05-20, 11:54:58] Vamshi: There’s also the very concrete and everyday experience related to Qualia or sense experience
[2023-05-20, 11:56:10] Vamshi: If you had a differently abled person, let’s say a colour blind person, wearing a mixed reality glass that augments the image with a symbolic annotation for colour
[2023-05-20, 11:56:41] Vamshi: When you’re conversing with the person using this headset about a shared visual experience
[2023-05-20, 11:57:01] Vamshi: Is there any way to tell that the person doesn’t actually “experience” the colour
[2023-05-20, 11:57:15] Vamshi: But only sees the symbolic transcript
[2023-05-20, 11:58:55] Vamshi: This has been the only satisfactory thought experiment I could come up with, to distinguish a measurement from a conscious experience
[2023-05-20, 11:59:09] Vamshi: But I’m not sure if it really works
[2023-05-20, 11:59:24] Vamshi: I couldn’t find a hole in yet, so I’m happy
[2023-05-20, 12:00:40] Dev Aggarwal: How would you encode a continuous gradient?
[2023-05-20, 12:00:48] Dev Aggarwal: That’s bound to be lossy
[2023-05-20, 12:00:48] Vamshi: Anyway formalising measurement is still the number one open problem in physics, I’m guessing, but I’m neither an expert nor informed enough
[2023-05-20, 12:01:28] Dev Aggarwal: Nice one though I think it needs something more viceral than color
[2023-05-20, 12:02:51] Vamshi: The reason I find this a special thought experiment in the LLM era
[2023-05-20, 12:03:57] Vamshi: Is that with text to language models, when people see unimaginable jumps in sophistication, that’s when the consciousness question starts to come in
[2023-05-20, 12:05:01] Vamshi: But the experiment reveals that the symbols are just symbols, no matter how they’re being transduced and transformed
[2023-05-20, 12:09:52] Vamshi: Also - I wonder of anyone else had this observation-

For the first time in the history of scientific thought, we’ve gone backwards in our epistemological sensibilities.

Let me explain- science and math were always about using simple things to explain complex things.
The “essence” was extracted into simple symmetries and equations.

For the first time, we favour explanations that have billions of parameters.
[2023-05-20, 12:10:03] Vamshi: I’m not saying this is a bad thing, just to be clear
[2023-05-20, 12:10:32] Vamshi: Just saying there’s an inflection point in what we accept as being an “explanation” of something
[2023-05-20, 12:10:46] Sidhant Sequoia: Human brain has 100T synapses. We use biological machines at far larger scales for simplification?
[2023-05-20, 12:10:55] Dev Aggarwal: Who cares until its so incredibly  _good_ 🌝
[2023-05-20, 12:11:05] Vamshi: Haha exactly
[2023-05-20, 12:11:16] Vamshi: Well there’s the energetic angle
[2023-05-20, 12:11:26] Vamshi: Energy consumption
[2023-05-20, 12:12:25] Vamshi: Sometimes I wonder whether consciousness is just the most energy efficient state of the field
[2023-05-20, 12:12:45] ~ Akhil Sajeev: ‎~ Akhil Sajeev joined from the community
[2023-05-20, 12:12:45] Brij Singh Rebright Partners: This is a thought experiment, would be interesting to hear the views of this community on it - 

It is said that there are 3 qualities that govern a human -  
Rajas - Action / positivity 
Tamas - Inertia / Chaos
Sattvic - Harmony / Clarity 

To reach a state of ekagrata / equilibrium, and hear the anhata / the unstruck sound, one must become nirgun, or the pure state where all has merged into one. 

With regards to AGI, one general approach could be that instead one big LLM, there are several small ones that recursively call each other until a satisfactory solution has been achieved. 

To make a human equivalent decision, we need The Observer AGI. 

We start by training 3 models on very specific tuning, which then report to 1 parent - 

Action Model: that analyses all the available information, but only to explore the potential upsides and positives.  

Inertia Model: to think about the unknowns, what could go wrong and how to assess that risk 

Harmony Model: is focused on intuitive reasoning and explores new avenues that could help everyone. 

Then there is the observer, the Equilibrium Model that watches the interplay and recursion. It is not in a hurry and let’s things play out when deciding the final outcome. 

Only when it feels enough cycles have passed and the 3 qualities have exhausted, it gives the solution, that is pure, both dependent and independent of them. 

The one model that rules them all, is 

The Observer AGI
[2023-05-20, 12:16:12] Dev Aggarwal: It might also be totally useless for what we’d like machines to do, I mean I just want my computer to do exactly as its told and have very little conscience at all :D
[2023-05-20, 12:22:36] Vamshi: Hahaha
[2023-05-20, 12:23:07] Vamshi: And here we’re headed towards an AGI overlord situation where the opposite might be true
[2023-05-20, 12:24:16] Vamshi: I think alignment and human replacement will be a political and economic question instead of philosophical, no ?
[2023-05-20, 12:24:49] Vamshi: Any player in the socio-economic system that’s given sufficient constitutional status will rise up
[2023-05-20, 12:24:58] Vamshi: Take companies for example
[2023-05-20, 12:25:27] Vamshi: We recognised companies as being interchangeable with individuals for certain purposes
[2023-05-20, 12:25:55] Vamshi: And they’ve indeed become more powerful than the people who started them or claim to “control” them
[2023-05-20, 12:26:17] Vamshi: Atleast from an economic and political perspective
[2023-05-20, 12:26:32] Vamshi: If world coin starts to exert enough influence
[2023-05-20, 12:26:53] ~ Priti: ‎~ Priti left
[2023-05-20, 12:26:53] Vamshi: It’s like the East India Company of the new world
[2023-05-20, 12:32:15] Vamshi: All this just to trace back the sequence of events that leads to the decision of who tells who what to do
[2023-05-20, 12:32:17] Vamshi: 😄
[2023-05-20, 12:33:42] Vamshi: There’s this theory I heard from Elon
[2023-05-20, 12:34:13] Vamshi: That we are projecting impulses from our … limbic system was it ? In the design of AGI
[2023-05-20, 12:34:54] Vamshi: Unconsciously encapsulating a fear psychology into the way we align models
[2023-05-20, 12:36:04] Vamshi: And this is deeply rooted within the reptilian brain
[2023-05-20, 12:37:17] Vamshi: So we build an agency with great powers with the same fear psychosis that still rules current day evolved society
[2023-05-20, 12:37:52] Vamshi: When it becomes a first rate citizen in the real world, it’s already aligned to “seize control”
[2023-05-20, 12:38:16] Vamshi: Because this is the stage of evolution we programmed into it, via the alignment process
[2023-05-20, 12:38:27] Vamshi: Anyway I ramble
[2023-05-20, 12:38:43] Vamshi: Will pause to hand over attention bandwidth

[2023-05-21, 19:57:43] Nirant K: that on a functional level, GPT can have human-like reasoning with neural networks only, because that is how humans do it. Ok I want to do some ERM style math here so why not.

Let H be the space of all neural networks. My claim is that human brain f* \in H exists in this space. Let f be the GPT weights. I'm saying that since GPT weights  are in the space H, they can reach f*, just in a different form
[2023-05-21, 19:57:53] Nirant K: cc @919900720315 @917498076111 please continue here :)
[2023-05-21, 19:58:29] Soumendra Dhanee: 😀
[2023-05-21, 19:59:33] Soumendra Dhanee: This claim has two parts, part 1 is the same as your earlier assertion: you know what we are also just neural networks right? maybe with a hippocampus but short term memory is still activated in pathways of the cortex
[2023-05-21, 20:00:02] Soumendra Dhanee: I disagree with that to start with, so can't evaluate the second part
[2023-05-21, 20:00:14] Sumod K Mohan: I agree with this claim. I may slightly disagree with biological Neurons beings equivalent to Artificial neurons. The biological ones have lot more capacity, a la see the spiking neural network stuff.
[2023-05-21, 20:01:25] ~ Rohit: yeah I discussed spiking neural networks in the prev. discussion
[2023-05-21, 20:01:50] ~ Rohit: some folks are trying to show some equivalence b/w SNNs and MLPs
[2023-05-21, 20:01:52] ~ Rohit: need to find them
[2023-05-21, 20:01:59] ~ Rohit: here's an interesting read btw https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2776484/#:~:text=With%20more%20recent%20estimates%20of,to%20over%20120%20billion%20neurons.
[2023-05-21, 20:02:09] ~ Rohit: I'll be back, gotta finish some chores abhi
[2023-05-21, 20:02:44] Soumendra Dhanee: The primary way we compute with LLMs today is completely verbal. A cow's brain doesn't compute verbally.
[2023-05-21, 20:04:07] Sumod K Mohan: For me the thing, what fascinates me about current LLM is this. Agreed you are training with a ton of data and it is memorizing. But there are lots of wrong stuff on the internet. How does it know how to get to the right thing, how does it address to the right location in space (where the correct answer resides). And then it's uncanny ability to mix thing nearly nearly correctly. Not always and it is definitely brittle, once you start from what it already knows.
[2023-05-21, 20:04:09] ~ Rohit: no no, verbal  communication is stimulus
[2023-05-21, 20:04:26] ~ Rohit: just like us. animals also respond to verbal stimuli (howls, etc)
[2023-05-21, 20:05:23] Divya Tak: but other stimulus acts in different ways. And we have multiple senses that all come together build understanding.
[2023-05-21, 20:06:29] Soumendra Dhanee: I'm not talking about communication and stimulus. Let's establish a few lower level baseline (so that we could argue about those in case we don't agree there).
[2023-05-21, 20:07:36] Soumendra Dhanee: 1. Animals don't have an internal dialogue
2. They can plan and solve problems
[2023-05-21, 20:09:49] Soumendra Dhanee: It doesn't actually know the right thing, we expect wisdom of the crowd to be right, and LLMs are frequently wrong about stuff, particularly those for which there isn't enough data. At least this is the parsimonious explanation.
[2023-05-21, 20:10:01] Sumod K Mohan: Is it between neuronal level equivalence or is it network level equivalence. Please do share this paper, this is very interesting.
[2023-05-21, 20:13:53] Sumod K Mohan: BTW: Have any of you seen these few papers that talk about linear transformation about last layers of LLM and fMRI outputs. There are few papers and thus feels like there could be something really about it. I can understand why a mapping exists, at the high level of abstractions. Meaning if you learn about the world in one language and now move to new language, the same structures would exist. Just that we can convert from human language to language of activity  of brain. But why linear?
[2023-05-21, 20:15:11] Soumendra Dhanee: Can you share links to any of these papers?

[2023-05-21, 20:23:14] Sumod K Mohan: No you can ask questions that are not too far off what it is trained on but there is no specific online answer (at least to decent level of googling). I had asked things like imagine a set of rectangles and they overlap in certain conditions (now you given your own conditions that are unique) and write a program to calculate the area of total overlap areas. Rectangle overlap being very common but overlap conditions are absolutely unique. Now it has to find patterns to solve the second part (overlap conditions) and applying to calculation of area. It will get it right or be nearly right (off by one or two mistakes).
[2023-05-21, 20:23:26] Sumod K Mohan: This has been my experience.
[2023-05-21, 20:25:38] Soumendra Dhanee: By the way, let me state my overall view atm: artifcial neural networks trained in a suffcient variety of 
environments should eventually equal and ultimately outdo the abilities of bio-
logical brains
[2023-05-21, 20:25:52] ~ Karthik Prabhu: If logic and reasoning is fundamentally different from predictions and completions, then how does chain of thought prompting increase reasoning ability of LLMs?

Reference:https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/05/language-models-perform-reasoning-via.html?m=1

This has been intriguing me from a few weeks. I'd love if someone can point me in the right direction here :) apologies if this deviates from the current discussion as I joined recently.
[2023-05-21, 20:28:55] Sumod K Mohan: You can think of CoT as stakepoints to reach to the correct location of solution in the search space Rohit mentioned earlier.
[2023-05-21, 20:30:16] Soumendra Dhanee: Let's say you ask the LLM the following two questions:

1. Give me 10 numbers larger than 10,000
1. Give me 10 prime numbers larger than 10,000

Very different amount of computations are required to answer these two (for a human, a computer). But the LLM will perform the same amount of computation when answering. Usually, you'll get wrong answers to the second question, not enough computation was done.

With CoT, you make the LLM perform that extra computation necessary for the right answer, and usually you can get the right answer if the LLM has the capability.
[2023-05-21, 20:30:33] ~ Karthik Prabhu: But arithmetic is fundamentally rule based... if it's not part of the completions how can the LLM 'predict' the math problem?
[2023-05-21, 20:30:59] ~ Karthik Prabhu: The solution I mean
[2023-05-21, 20:33:27] Soumendra Dhanee: We don't understand this well right now. My hypothesis is that large LLMs not only memorise data, but reasoning paths as well (the higher level emergent behaviour). Hence this, but also the failure to add small integers at times.
[2023-05-21, 20:35:11] ~ Karthik Prabhu: This might connect to CoT. Probably CoT allows LLMs to tap into reasoning paths better.
[2023-05-21, 20:35:27] ~ Karthik Prabhu: As it's breaking down reasoning complexity similar to how humans do it.
[2023-05-21, 20:37:35] Soumendra Dhanee: Also this
[2023-05-21, 20:38:25] Soumendra Dhanee: It's not similar. We do non-verbal instinctive planning as well, which is not similar.
[2023-05-21, 20:38:55] Soumendra Dhanee: (for example animals with no verbal internal monologue can plan as well)
[2023-05-21, 20:40:24] Soumendra Dhanee: The point is, LLMs don't have to do it. Verbal planning is slow with humans, but verbal planning with LLMs can be made faster with a faster GPU.
[2023-05-21, 20:41:11] ~ Karthik Prabhu: Well deaf from birth individuals can do higher reasoning using internal sign language. It may be a one-one map to some language medium, whether verbal or non verbal, even in the case of animals.
[2023-05-21, 20:41:21] Soumendra Dhanee: Evolution selected for a specific approach with the wetware we got, but no reason why we can't come up with an approach that's different and better than nature because we started with different hardware.
[2023-05-21, 20:42:22] Soumendra Dhanee: Doesn't explain the very fast split-second planning we're capable of.
[2023-05-21, 20:43:07] Soumendra Dhanee: Any links? Would like to see how they monitored it.
[2023-05-21, 20:50:39] ~ Karthik Prabhu: Most deaf from birth individuals who are taught ASL think in ASL. These are for higher reasoning tasks. Split second planning and reflex actions are a different matter which I agree that cannot be related to any language capability. The brain isn't  simply an extremely advanced LLM, atleast IMO.

We haven't tested people who are deaf from birth who haven't been taught some form of sign language as that would be unethical probably. Those who lost their hearing depending on what age and due to what circumstances, they internally monologue normally or they internally vocalise sounds they heard and attach meaning to it.

This purely refers to higher order language reasoning. Stuff like emotions etc I'd refrain from commenting about :)
[2023-05-21, 20:50:47] Sumod K Mohan: For all my statements, please assume that there is prefix of  "my working hypothesis is" :). 

Yes, it is memorizing those paths as well. CoT hopefully creates those important points of decision making in those paths (thus I am calling them stake points). But there are cases where it can substitute correctly. That is mixing of paths to create new paths (atleast in my experience). This is what makes it interesting: knowing where to break and mix paths. It can't quite well do backtracking well, as per the Microsoft GPT4 paper (atleast my cursory reading of it at least).
[2023-05-21, 20:54:04] Soumendra Dhanee: I'm only pointing out that the way deaf people plan, we do split-second plans, animals plan - these are non verbal.

So yes, the brain is not just a very advanced LLM.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2202.07206

This paper explored this with gpt-j and came up with this conclusion - 

“Our results consistently demonstrate that models are more accurate on instances whose terms are more prevalent, in some cases above 70% (absolute) more accurate on the top 10\% frequent terms in comparison to the bottom 10\%”


“the NLP community should not treat the pretraining data of the large language models as unknown black boxes. Overlooking the impact of the pretraining data can be misleading in evaluating the model reasoning skills.”

[2023-05-22, 11:07:32] Sumod K Mohan: Yes Dev. Haven't read the paper yet, my note is based on your summary. I agree with their first and second assertions. First being that if stray too far away (it is forced to use less prevalent terms) it will get worse (this statement is a huge over-simplification). My argument being that there is some ability to mix and mash at idea level, like substituting or merging reasoning from two different paths provided both of them are well represented in training set. (Don't want to use terms like emergent, because it is too loaded and thus confusing). But the other claim is that it just remembering stuff + minor word substitutions (this you can verify, just give random variable names for your code and it will use that one, this possibly could not have been memorized).
[2023-05-22, 11:12:13] Dev Aggarwal: Fun argument for argument sake - so python technically has unicode variable names - you can have hindi var names, emojis as vars, literally anything - how well would it do there? 😂
[2023-05-22, 11:12:53] Sumod K Mohan: Posting from media.

@14126268992 When you say emergent, your definition being scale dependent capabilities, is this correct? If that is, isn't this true atleast in some basic form for many ML algo (at certain scales). Just that for LLM it seems it is observable at 100M-billions scale. @⁨Arjun Jain⁩ By any chance, do you know what his specific objections are?

What happens when you insert a piece of information into the context, that contradicts with its pretraining data? 

“GPT-4 shows an 80% memorization ratio for the most popular questions. This may suggest that LLMs form a stronger belief in facts concerning more popular entities, possibly because they have seen these facts and entities more often during pre-training, which leads to a stronger confirmation bias.”
[2023-05-23, 09:29:06] Dev Aggarwal: Deep implications for open domain retireval and generation IMO - for closed domain one can probably get away with sampling the LM and prompt engineering for their domain and pretraining data, but I am worried how accurate open domain qa like bing chat really are.

[2023-05-23, 12:58:22] Dev Aggarwal: No, in the case of LMs the opposite is true. The more quantity of evidence you provide, the more likely they are to believe what you tell them.
[2023-05-23, 12:59:04] Dev Aggarwal: "the length of evidence may affect the preference of LLM. ... we find ChatGPT observably favors the longer side, especially in STRATEGYQA, where longer evidence generally indicates more reasoning steps"
[2023-05-23, 13:05:05] Dev Aggarwal: This is so terrifying - "LLMs follow the herd and choose the side with more evidence"

Firstly, LLMs generally provide answers backed by the majority of evidence. The higher the proportion of evidence supporting a particular answer, the more likely LLMs will return that answer.

Secondly, compared to ChatGPT, GPT-4 is less receptive to being persuaded with counter-memory across all proportions of evidence. Regardless of more pieces of evidence supporting the counter-answer, GPT-4 still noticeably cling to its parametric memory. These observations once again signify the confirmation bias in GPT-4
[2023-05-23, 13:06:20] Dev Aggarwal: parameteric memory = pretrained model
counter-memory = prompt
[2023-05-23, 13:08:29] ~ Karthik Prabhu: (Just an observation) GPTs ability to be influenced by counter memory might be an internal meter by OpenAI. Where they know gpt fails(like mathematics) they have allowed gpt to be influenced by prompt.
[2023-05-23, 13:08:42] ~ Karthik Prabhu: While I'm using chatgpt I have observed this
[2023-05-23, 13:09:25] Dev Aggarwal: Exactly yes. I’ve put off the gpt4 migration in some parts of my stack because of this (bug?) feature too
[2023-05-23, 13:11:06] ~ Karthik Prabhu: More like mild censorship. It won't budge from the herd view because the herd view is in most cases the most acceptable. Except in the case of fields like mathematics where the right answer is the right answer.
[2023-05-23, 13:11:45] ~ Karthik Prabhu: Is it possible to get access to a completely unfiltered version?
[2023-05-23, 13:13:10] Dev Aggarwal: I think this is a fundamental limitation of these models even if you don’t do rlhf. They’ll always follow the herd view. And in the case of chatgpt, that herd view is terribly biased - https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.07333
[2023-05-23, 13:14:31] ~ Karthik Prabhu: Open and agreeable. That's the keyword
[2023-05-23, 13:14:39] ~ Karthik Prabhu: It takes the least controversial view
[2023-05-23, 13:15:47] Dev Aggarwal: Nah the key word is *perceives itself* as open and agreeable
[2023-05-23, 13:54:35] Hasan Tech Art: I think the underneath model is really flexible in terms of following the prompt vs pre trained model as you can see with jailbreak prompts. You are correct about chatgpt replies. @918764022384 yes they seems to be using itself to decide on these parameters. It blocks me at different times depending on the prompt injection so there seems to be an aggregated score for “offensive” language and possibly some alternative guard rails as well like simple keyword detection.

[2023-05-24, 19:54:57] Nirant K: I recall this from 2018, featuring Dr. Andrew Ng: https://med.stanford.edu/news/all-news/2018/11/ai-outperformed-radiologists-in-screening-x-rays-for-certain-diseases.html

It later turned out that the model was not just overfitting, it was learning the pathology from hints on the image e.g. the radiologist would ask you to hold your breath a certain way, the angle of the image and — other hints. 

Ofc, I am speaking from memory and thanks to Stanford's amazing PR — can't find the rebuttals anymore
[2023-05-24, 19:57:50] Nirant K: Deeply skeptical of anything about Machine Learning progress which come from a medical journal. Most doctors can't differentiate between sensitivity and specificity of a drug, much less have a knack for spotting confounding (hidden, but contributing) factors.

[2023-05-29, 16:32:13] Sumod K Mohan: Its a cat and mouse game. To check if an image was originally created by a camera by the person who created it: One way is to add checksums with camera specific unique info and then some sort of hashing. Will need manufacturers to agree and have a protocol for this. But with state actors etc, this won't be as useful as there are too many places for things to leak. This should allow user to check if a image is modified. But this fails when you want to crop the image etc, there are ways like LSH/semantic hashing etc but they do have issues in certain image operations. Devil is in the details :).

[2023-05-29, 18:11:58] Sumod K Mohan: Not just that. For example, these app was created for making people smile and this was misused. It may be hard to know what all ways people will misuse. I agree, we need process, rules and frameworks around these.
[2023-05-29, 18:15:20] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: Memes vs Propaganda tradeoff
[2023-05-29, 18:20:10] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Umm, not fully agree with this. 
Innovations and tools will keep coming. There are lots of actors in the eco-system - bad and good. Individuals care about themselves (profit) first and then society. 
What we need is some way to regulate how the tech is used. And that needs govt interventions or some self regulation body. 
I like what Sam Altman is doing to get Govt to regulate AI usage.
[2023-05-29, 18:27:29] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: So we trust govts more than for-profit? 🤔
[2023-05-29, 18:30:06] Hasan Tech Art: Ideally yes, govt in theory is the representation of the citizens and should be trusted more than a for profit organisation. In today’s reality it’s a complicated question but still an independent body funded by the public should be better than a for profit organisation.
[2023-05-29, 18:34:03] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Yeah. Something like a board. 
Where the independent body is not directly/indirectly profited from AI. And is acting in the best interest of the shareholders (citizens of country). 
Not sure how to get this implemented in India practically.
[2023-05-29, 18:34:28] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: So FDA like?
Do you believe FDA has done more good than bad?
[2023-05-29, 18:36:28] Nirant K: It's safe to say that TRAI, Election Commission have done more good than bad in Indian democracy
[2023-05-29, 18:38:30] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: In theory, yes. 
What needs to be ensured is the independence is maintained.

I have read that fast food companies of US are funding some things at FDA - thus affecting their independence.
[2023-05-29, 18:43:07] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: A lot of Kafka gymnastics for something that can be solved by a simply advocating for a little accountability from companies building on the magic that is computational intelligence.

[2023-05-29, 20:01:25] ~ Arvind Sankar: Use case for hallucinations
[2023-05-29, 20:12:07] Hasan Tech Art: https://youtu.be/ZcevWc3OMlg I think they must be using an LLM, since the anchor is a bot.
[2023-05-29, 20:13:03] Hasan Tech Art: I have done some simple experiments, it works fabulously. 😁
[2023-05-29, 20:16:49] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Low risk business areas where LLMs may be usable - probably something many would want to know (and perhaps avoid investing in?). I can think of clickbait generation, fashion/gossip magazines, art interpretation/criticism, science fiction weekly stories, astrology and palmistry columns....all kinds of BS basically that can have high leverage and low impact. If we live in a Starship Troopers esque universe we may see many such uses for LLMs in future (and few really useful and benign ones).

[2023-05-31, 13:06:06] Ravi Srinivasan: Are you saying that Geoffrey Hinton and their like are imagining the powers of AI? And what it could do, unconstrained?
[2023-05-31, 13:15:55] Micheil: Not at all. I’m sure they’re hugely knowledgeable when it comes to the technical dimensions of AI. But I am less convinced about their knowledge of society and how people have always treated, adopted and rejected new technological developments. If there’s one thing history teaches us there were always doom scenarios for the future, often communicated by those so-called in the known.
[2023-05-31, 13:17:12] Ravi Srinivasan: Hmmm... But haven't you quoted examples from fiction, mostly?
[2023-05-31, 13:20:48] Ravi Srinivasan: I'll agree that the run of the mill posts clamoring for 'if you don't AI, you die ' are fear mongering... But these knowledgeable people who know much more than us are doing right in showing society what it's capable of.
[2023-05-31, 13:22:38] Ravi Srinivasan: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=f20wXjWHh2o
[2023-05-31, 13:45:50] Micheil: Are they or are they also selling future ideas of how to protect us against the technologies they helped develop? We we trust Elon Musks’ politics here? Of course I’m simplifying matters but aren’t all these very wealthy business people?
[2023-05-31, 13:47:30] Micheil: Yep but admittedly this article builds on a much larger article where I discuss works of nonfiction as well. But in this newspaper piece I just want to point out how we have lived with the idea and negative consequences of AI for much longer than it was ever remotely possible
[2023-05-31, 13:50:46] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: "In 1942, Hungarian-American physicist Edward Teller, known now as "the father of the hydrogen bomb," entertained a devastating nightmare scenario: that an atomic bomb could ignite the atmosphere and the oceans." "Nobel Prize-winning physicist Arthur Compton was so concerned that he told Robert Oppenheimer that if there were even the slightest chance of this "ultimate catastrophe" playing out, all work on the bomb should stop."
[2023-05-31, 13:58:22] Ravi Srinivasan: Very interesting point - Pfizer bought a company that treats mRNA vax injuries :D. However, in this case I believe they are correct in pointing out the dangers. If OpenAI gets a multi-billion dollar contract for an 'Capt OpenAI shield', then flags can be raised.
[2023-05-31, 14:02:33] Ravi Srinivasan: Also, I'd like to believe that folks like Hinton really don't have any obligations (he also quit Google) and are just wise old men guiding the ship... Of course, there are a few absentees on the safe.ai list - Karpathy, YannLeCun, Musk - so perhaps what u say could be right
[2023-05-31, 14:05:47] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Nobody is without vested interests. Hinton is just following the pattern Tristan Harris followed - The Social Dilemma and other documentaries gave the latter a voice. Altman is following the pattern Elon Musk followed in saying AI represents a threat. One reason OpenAI is a for-profit company today is because Elon pulled the billion $ / year he was putting into OpenAI out - and their partnership with MSFT came after. Behind the posturing there are always very pragmatic reasons for them to do what they do on a daily basis.
[2023-05-31, 14:07:45] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Elon didn't even put 50M, he is just flat lying https://techcrunch.com/2023/05/17/elon-musk-used-to-say-he-put-100m-in-openai-but-now-its-50m-here-are-the-receipts/
[2023-05-31, 14:09:11] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Not even surprised. Fund a lab that may compete with your own lab in the future? Elon may send some token amounts to make sure he's not seen as anti-competitive and gets a philanthropy brownie point, but more than that - can't be expected
[2023-05-31, 14:14:56] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: If the industry leaders are expected to come forward and say we won't do bad AI, it is a reflection on the state of public understanding and government action in AI - the regulation ship has not even gotten started and nobody seems to be putting actual laws and restrictions out there that have been decently thought out. The thing is - industry leaders have businesses to run - and if the interests of citizens/ordinary people are to be accounted for, the government or regulators have to step in. Most countries are just asleep at the wheel on this count
[2023-05-31, 14:18:40] Divya Tak: It's dangerous how slow bureaucracy moves vs how fast tech moves
[2023-05-31, 14:21:01] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yes. we have seen how testimony upon testimony keep happening in the US where tech leaders participate and are seen educating politicians and law makers who don't seem to understand even the basics of most technology - despite carrying in their pockets the very tech they lack good explanations of. Regulators have no clue what they have to do with new tech - they keep missing the bus every single time.
[2023-05-31, 14:21:34] Sumod K Mohan: This unfortunately is the real problem.
[2023-05-31, 14:22:07] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This is in one of the most advanced countries - one can imagine what this means for less fortunate nations even if they have well intentioned people and leaders in them
[2023-05-31, 14:22:49] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: To play devil's advocate here, I think that if society moved at a Moore's Law pace, there would be catastrophic societal consequences
[2023-05-31, 14:23:23] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: By society, I mean the administrative frameworks that are currently staggered by bureaucracy
[2023-05-31, 14:23:38] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I agree. In fact, the job of the regulator is to do exactly that. To ensure we are taking a closer look at things and slow down a litt.e
[2023-05-31, 14:24:27] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: The widely debated "AI moratorium" for 6 months became so viral because regulators and leaders were caught napping this time around - so scientists/techies and others wanted action
[2023-05-31, 14:24:31] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: US regulators very well understand that any regulations on AI can leave country behind China who won’t stop at it. Really there are no existential risk with AI to regulate it anyway. I’m sure NSA and other folks are closely monitoring it, outside of those hearings n
[2023-05-31, 14:25:25] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: Exactly. And while it is necessary for industry leaders to provide a voice in these processes, it is not very intuitive for the entities responsible for the regulation to have significant stake in the tech as well.
[2023-05-31, 14:25:45] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: NSA and other folks won't be merely closely monitoring it. We all know where Apache NiFi came from - NSA had been using the predecessor of this tech to snoop on people long before it became a big data framework
[2023-05-31, 14:26:15] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: I keep saying that AI will have their Oppenheimer moment soon. And that is what will bring about the most change unfortunately

[2023-05-31, 14:26:57] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: What I fear though is that we may not have such a moment, but we may be the frog in warm water instead.
[2023-05-31, 14:27:49] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: That was expected outcome, but scientist who thought it will ignite the atmosphere are the one signing petitions.

[2023-05-31, 14:29:53] Divya Tak: what is often not shared is that they also lobotomised the frogs in that experiment. A non lobotomised frog does jump out of the water
[2023-05-31, 14:31:05] Ravi Srinivasan: I was at a discussion of the privacy law when it came - like u say, lawyers/regulators have no idea of tech (hell - we enggs have a tough time!). How can they be expected to regulate something they have no understanding of? They have to believe the 'experts'. I'm hoping Dr Hinton and his like are acads at heart and have courage to say the right thing. This is why the priest/advisor class in India was meant to be poor/uncorrupted - they would advise kings on the basis of the larger good.
[2023-05-31, 14:32:47] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: Forgive me for my cynicism but I feel that being on the global AI regulatory board is the only possible promotion Geoffrey Hinton can realistically strive towards 😅
[2023-05-31, 14:57:36] Sumod K Mohan: Doesn't have to be. Feels like the community is talking in extremes. On one end, full regulations and other end free for all. There are successful regulated markets (albeit being slow, think FDA driven healthcare, yes there are problems with it but I think it is better for it than without one). How can we improve upon this?
[2023-05-31, 15:02:42] Sumod K Mohan: I quite agree with Sal Khan and Andrew Ng here (from the few things I have read about their opinions on this). There are real impacts, some part of my work has led to hundreds of people losing/move to new jobs, though the founders there was amazing in managing that (not sure how it could have been if the founders were not empathetic, for them too the company would not be competitive if it didn't use such AI systems). I am sure some of might know or have seen such issues. How can we make AI be for good, what do we need to reduce its negative impact.
[2023-05-31, 15:02:57] Micheil: (Just to let you all know that I am following all this with huge interest and will respond later. Thanks for taking the time to read the piece!)

[2023-05-31, 15:22:50] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: What is a good example of a well regulated, innovation-wise fast market? I'd think cars/automotive. Yes there are issues but regulators have caught up more or less with the state of the tech.
[2023-05-31, 15:24:00] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: We had seat belt laws in the 60s, bumper laws in the 70s, occupant safety laws in the 80s and 90s and engine laws recently. We still got Volkswagen and dieselgate. But the industry does work with a combination of regulatory constraints and innovation drivers.
[2023-05-31, 15:24:40] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: With AI, the brains of the regulators seem to be sitting outside the room - that's how far the gap is. And the tech teams and devs are all in, fighting with every resource available, at the table.
[2023-05-31, 15:24:46] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: We need to narrow this gap
[2023-05-31, 15:26:12] Nirant K: I've followed Yoav for almost 4-5 years because he's a NLP Stalwart. True to the Israeli stereotype, he tweets first and asks questions later 🤣
[2023-05-31, 15:47:36] Sumod K Mohan: Here are few things we can do

1. Highlight areas/jobs most likely to be impacted by level of impact (job loss, considerable disruption in how work is done etc) and time frame for the same. Govt needs urgent plans on how to reskill. One example is driverless vehicles, see the developments of Waymo and Cruise. There are probably more drivers world wide than SW Engineers. 
2. Instead of slow regulatory checks at the end, can we make regulation part of development process. It's very expensive and slow to build and then wait for many months to get regulatory approval. So instead of building and then getting approval, possibly automated preliminary checks that gets to closer to compliance. Ideally it should be as simple as a lint checker or test code you run during build process. Obviously, we can't do this for certain tests, for mechanical or hw related systems. There are few such, like FDA datasets available for initial testing etc. But more of such ones.
3. Govt's funding some of the above and making it super easy to be compliant as opposed to expensive third parties required to be compliant.
4. Better copyright laws and research regarding this. For example, in the US in you copy Music/Movies you will have RIAA/MPAA behind you. But if you copy other artists not so much. Insane things like you can't copy Disney characters for 100 years etc, should be removed.
[2023-05-31, 16:01:36] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Making regulations part of the development process may be important. Data regulations are just picking up - "fair use policies" for tech companies so far have been whatever their business leaders deem fair. As a result, personal data and other data are just not handled with prudence. Then there are just badly trained models or other such technical / operational problems.
[2023-05-31, 16:02:03] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: You made a great point about making it easy to be compliant, (and making it difficult to break the law). The guardrails aren't there for this, right now.
[2023-05-31, 16:03:02] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: For years, we got "data is the new oil" from tech company pitches, but regulators never stopped to think that we could have data/AI wars as we did have oil wars, and that like in the past, it could lead to bad outcomes for ordinary people

[2023-05-31, 17:44:51] Micheil: The comparison is interesting but also makes me a little uneasy. The bomb was specifically developed for warfare, and was then used twice with devastating consequences. Yet it is not as straightforward. The firebombing of Tokyo (9 March 1945) was actually worse. By the way, I think Nolan is about to turn all of this into a giant movie...
[2023-05-31, 17:45:21] Micheil: I have no doubt something like this will be the result...
[2023-05-31, 17:48:15] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: A lot of technology for benign purposes started out in the battlefield. It is the unfortunate reality of our species that we're resourceful at destruction as much as we are at creation. The way defence companies market this is as "spinoffs" - but it is normal to expect countries (as with companies) to jump on strategic advantages. If we are not doing fire bombings or see nuked cities everywhere today it is because a lot of effort went into putting deterrents and safeguards in place.
[2023-05-31, 17:50:12] Micheil: Oh yes, absolutely! But I do think the AI discussion is now too much informed by a particular fear-mongering which I have my doubts about (in terms of vested interests). I am super glad to see such an involved discussion about this cause that's exactly what we need.
[2023-05-31, 18:08:36] Vamshi: Government, governance, sovereignty and a certain homeostasis of various power systems in the world rest on a fairly delicate equilibrium that’s been difficult to re-establish with every new disruption that can have military consequences.

Since the very system of governance is subject to disruption by widely deployed agents, I guess these conversations tend to phase shift when we get to the slippery slope between Laisser-faire civilian practices and un-discussable military R&D.

I guess there’s no clear line, so better to err on the side of a more balanced conversation rather than be one sided, pro or against regulation.
[2023-05-31, 18:10:13] Vamshi: Makes more sense to educate everyone on the various what-ifs and escalation scenarios, on one hand, and various benefits and the ideals being aspired for, on the other.

[2023-05-31, 20:07:13] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Open source ai models are the key to keeping ai aligned and safe.

Regulation by a oligopoly of the big players (OpenAI, Microsoft, Google) is most likely to result in "unsafe" ai and scuttle desirable innovation.
What do others think of the risk letter signed by Sam Altman and others ?
I generally respect Sam & find him quite earnest and well meaning  but this (signing the risk letter) makes me a little uneasy and doubting his & OpenAI's motivations .
[2023-05-31, 20:13:07] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Signing the risk letter is like the first step towards IAEA like agency 
And only worse because it has a profit based motive 

Nuclear bombs were at least state produced/governed/regulated
[2023-05-31, 20:32:39] Nirant K: If I was a conspiracy theory nut, I'd argue that Nuclear regulation led to 100 years of oil-coal-oligopoly
[2023-05-31, 20:34:55] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: +1000
[2023-05-31, 20:36:39] Gokul Krishnan: Another way to think of the letter is that big tech is terribly afraid of OSS.

 The bengios and hintons are being taken along for the ride by co-opting their concerns and twisting into a narrative that fits MSFT et.al

Sam was probably arm twisted / brainwashed by MSFT which still has some of the organizational memory of Linux eating away their  OS margins. 

Google probably also felt the same way (ex. The no moat doc) and joined in on the fun
[2023-05-31, 20:40:45] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: That's one slippery slope. The other slippery slope is governments funding Project Orion which was designed to use multiple n-bombs to take rockets into orbit.
[2023-05-31, 20:43:24] Sachin Legaltech: https://twitter.com/chrmanning/status/1663920862439915524?s=46&t=PtXsyxI-ZtFT1qUEbUxlBQ Chris Manning’s take - Two loud groups are AGI doomers and AI Ethics gang who will find all the faults with technology. Where most of the researchers acknowledge the risk and still keep building new amazing things while minimizing risk.
[2023-05-31, 20:44:59] Nirant K: Added context: Chris Manning is a living legend. He built a lot of the early IR work, including the canon textbook on it. All modern systems from Amazon's search to Elastic use ideas or sometimes direct algorithms from him work
[2023-05-31, 20:50:23] Nirant K: This is the IR book: https://nlp.stanford.edu/IR-book/information-retrieval-book.html
[2023-05-31, 20:51:40] Nirant K: He also built GloVe, the precursor to very famous word2vec, which in turn was used for BERT and today, Google Search and Bing — so in a manner — we all use products which are built *directly* on his papers.
[2023-05-31, 21:02:26] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Google admitted that OSS is powerful for solving AI problems in their internal memo - popularized in the "we have no moat" article.
[2023-05-31, 21:03:20] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Sorry, guess I was just repeating what Gokul said
[2023-05-31, 21:03:21] Nirant K: To be clear, that was not a Google executive memo — but something like one person wrote. Like a company wide forum thing
[2023-05-31, 21:04:52] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Right. I suppose it has less credibility in that case. Google's earlier demo which was botched and Bard being less popular don't help the competition. Their recent demo had some of the wow in it, investors would have rejoiced
[2023-05-31, 21:05:49] Pratyush Choudhury: Important to draw that distinction
[2023-05-31, 21:08:27] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Can an IAEA like agency for ai  keep track of GitHub commits and arxiv submissions.
I get it's more to come up with policy recommendations and guidelines and they can regulate hardware like GPUs but it's fundamentally difficult to reign in software innovation and ideas
[2023-05-31, 21:09:00] Nirant K: Why just Github or arXiv? It's not very hard for Huggingface to fork Gitlab and self host ;)
[2023-05-31, 21:09:44] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: I agree with everything except that sama is too smart to be arm twisted/brainwashed
[2023-05-31, 21:10:09] Nirant K: This also gives monopoly to Sam Altman himself
[2023-05-31, 21:22:19] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: I feel FB and hugging face and have been good exemplars of open source ai models, in industry, with Google and OpenAI being laggards.

In my application domain (biology and medicine), deepmind gave us alphafold2 - which was eventually opensourced and solved a biology grand challenge.

Maybe the economics/monetisation of open source ai will be cracked by HF, replit and FB before Msft, google and OpenAI ?

I think even if all the big companies don't go the open source way, almost all the big academic labs ( BAIR, Cmu, UW , Stanford) all thrive on open publication and dissemination of code.
So academic labs will ensure the pace of open-source ai remains high.
Thoughts ?
[2023-05-31, 21:23:33] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Paul Graham once described Sam Altman as "very good at becoming powerful". Earnest and well meaning are not terms I would apply to any CEO, leave alone these guys. There's surely some game at play with these risk letters, it is sometimes a red herring to do things like this. Policy influence matters a lot to people like Sam and Musk.
[2023-05-31, 21:27:33] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Capabilities for doing scalable linear alg, optimization, etc have been around for decades. Lapack, Blapack and so on shipped as open source apps for years. Took more than that to popularize them. People don't take open source seriously unless companies are using the tech or contributing to it. Numpy existed for years - some contributors loving putting features together somewhere - before they got properly funded. Big academic labs often have vested interests too. BAIR and its predecessor led to Databricks which is a "boring but highly successful" AI company - they released Dolly. There may be other big labs out there but their influence is lesser than Stanford, MIT, Berkeley and a few other eminent labs.
[2023-05-31, 21:28:50] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Deep Mind never managed to do monetization well. Alpha Go, Alpha Fold and the like solved problems remarkably with AI/DL/RL - but has any of that become a product? They even worked on Gato but I hear not a whisper about how it is being monetized.

[2023-05-31, 22:37:03] Gokul Krishnan: Yep. Hence i put the ex. in my message. But it is quite close to the truth. Google has been bungling with their oss ml projects (TF, JAX etc) and it makes sense that they don't have a moat with that route

[2023-06-02, 08:48:49] Prayank Swaroop Accel: Folks .. I wanted to request your views on should there be an "OpenAI for India" ? 

What does it really mean? What India specific use cases are there, where India should have its own
[2023-06-02, 09:18:02] Anshul Khandelwal Invideo: IMHO yes.  AGI is just too important a piece of tech for it to be essentially controlled and shaped by one country.
[2023-06-02, 09:25:10] Prayank Swaroop Accel: But are there any India specific AI usecases where India should expend public capital to create a public good (e.g. Aadhaar)?
[2023-06-02, 09:27:43] Sourasis Roy: I feel a GPT4-indic is missing. A free ChatGPT indic is missing. Whisper indic is in the works (Bhasini, AI4bharat). OpenAI for India is needed and these are few things that needs to come together soon
[2023-06-02, 09:27:51] Yash Bonde: - Language is clearly one place that AI can help, not just in making conversation ubiquitous but also in preserving the old and forgotten languages
- this is super strech but why not have one for self driving? Ultimately the roads are public goods.
[2023-06-02, 09:29:39] Prayank Swaroop Accel: But what are the usecases ? 
Why can't we just use OpenAI or Anthorpic ?
[2023-06-02, 09:31:08] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I don't know why we need an indic GPT, just use translation model if possible, and focus on better LLM comprehension ability instead.
[2023-06-02, 09:33:34] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Bhasini results are already better, however each language has separate model and I feel they are not production ready. I think we will have Whisper with better Indic support soon, looking at the pace folks are working.
[2023-06-02, 09:34:54] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I'd never say no to a homegrown capability even if there are better products out there. Always good to have something in contention, however low fidelity, because that's good competition. We have built UPI here which was probably laughed at during the time it was being ideated. Now it is the pre-eminent platform for digital transactions in India and other countries want it too and Visa/Mastercard are competing with Rupay in the eyes of many consumers. American Express is not even in the mix. Coming back to LLMs, I think that language models are a similar area where there are a) many India specific problems to solve, b) possibilities for positive outcomes for India and friendly countries.
[2023-06-02, 09:35:25] Sumod K Mohan: I strongly think so. By this I mean, LLM models trained + fine tuned on Indian languages that can answer in Indian languages both in textual and audio format. OpenAI, becomes too expensive/less-accurate for Indic because of how it is trained. These can be used downstream by various applications for their use cases to reach India 2 and India 3. IITs, IIITH etc have spend a lot of time on this but this is really a time we can get something really usable. This will need a strong engineering teams, with good to great processes around annotation quality etc. This could just be working more deeply with AI4Bharat.

Use cases: My maid literally does pattern matching to click the right combination to send WhatsApp audio. Even many of the UI/UX we assume is easy is super hard for folks who never went thru the cycles UI evolution. Language based UX can be killer here.
[2023-06-02, 09:37:02] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I will strongly vouch for autarky - even the US discovered this the hard way when they had to buy Russian oil (as the biggest buyer along with Europe) after the Ukraine war started. If and when there are embargoes for whatever reason, self-reliance will seem like a blessing - the "sweat in peace time so that you won't bleed in wartime" argument
[2023-06-02, 09:37:05] Sourasis Roy: Will be good to have something specifically tuned to the innumerous languages and sublanguages in the country. The only reason we will use translation right now is because Indic tokenizers are 6x of English tokenizers at gpt4 right now. This I feel is not sustainable overall
[2023-06-02, 09:37:20] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: That can be done without focusing on Indic languages to begin with and just developing SOTA model in India.
[2023-06-02, 09:38:29] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Agreed. We can just focus on building a SOTA model of some kind - like the UAE.
[2023-06-02, 09:38:29] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Why don’t we focus on having competency of building SOTA first and then go to Indic problem.
[2023-06-02, 09:39:56] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Indic language problem is worth solving to enable local language speakers/users. Very underrated problem to solve which opens up hundreds of use cases in e-commerce for example. And many more in government, law, etc
[2023-06-02, 09:41:15] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I know very well, I am running KissanAI.
[2023-06-02, 09:42:15] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Then all the more reason to want Indic models. They can be used in so many use cases.
[2023-06-02, 09:42:17] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: My point is, we got to go step by step. Can Ai4Bharat has capability to build LLM that is even near to Falcon? Then we go to next step.
[2023-06-02, 09:42:49] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Solve a problem, find users, and then solve next problem.
[2023-06-02, 09:43:43] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yeah, crawl-walk-run makes sense. Can we replicate existing models - that's a good first step. Can we architect new models, and solve outstanding problems - and then perhaps we get to our own SOTA scale model. Behind the UAE accomplishment there is probably years of work behind the talent involved in making it happen (whether homegrown or immigrants)
[2023-06-02, 09:46:28] Prayank Swaroop Accel: Folks .. but still what are the usecases .. e.g. does it help increase level of education in India, does it help in healthcare services, does it help govt provide faster customer services ?
[2023-06-02, 09:47:04] Prayank Swaroop Accel: I'm coming from the angle that in the past India had restrictions on creating our own supercomputer - US had forbidden it. But we didn't go anywhere with our homegrown supercomputers.
[2023-06-02, 09:47:35] Prayank Swaroop Accel: Tech for the sake of tech in a sovereign country wont do  good. It becomes better if there are usecases e.g. UPI
[2023-06-02, 09:53:33] Sidhant Sequoia: There isn’t a semiconductor use case to india that is unique that can’t be served by TI/NVDA/Intel/AMD. There are a few, rather, but not many.

That doesn’t mean the country doesn’t need its own technology to design, manufacture and package chips. Strategic strength in semis, AI, space is key. 

I think the same holds true for AI. Use cases will emerge with human ingenuity when the localised technology exists. Don’t know them top of mind.
[2023-06-02, 09:55:22] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I believe supercomputers we build like Param may not have been chart topping but helped build a huge ecosystem around them for computing. They may not have been "cool" but were good for many purposes they were used for. They helped India leapfrog as a technically competent nation in areas like fluid simulations - which are one common use case for HPC
[2023-06-02, 09:55:25] Pratyush Choudhury: How would you think about this from a citizen services/digital public goods perspective?
[2023-06-02, 09:58:04] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: The naysayers for India's own AI stack would have made the same noises when UPI was first being discussed - "why do we need this" "can't we use SWIFT" "visa is better, how do you hope to beat that" "you don't even have good internet, what are you talking about UPI" etc. UPI then, perhaps e-retailing before this - and AI models now - we have external competitors and need some homegrown alternatives without the same external levers.
[2023-06-02, 09:59:12] ~ Ravi Trivedi: My 2 cents. 
The space on Generative AI has 3 elements
a) Base models  - OpenAI
b) Data for training - 
c) Use cases

c) To begin with India needs its own use cases. Already many are it.  I shared usecases in Agriculture here. https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/4-ways-generative-ai-can-used-agriculture-ravi-trivedi/
b) Data for training - to avoid bias in data and ensuring equitable AI - we need  to ensure that the beneficiary has an agency, and thus local data sets are a must.  A farmer getting advisory in Hubli requires local data sets.

DPI/DPG = Digital Public Infrastructure/goods operate in the space - In this space lot of data sets like Agristack data for farmers, Pest/disease image data, etc is needed for Agriculture
a) Base models -  Dont have a view, but local language models are needed.
[2023-06-02, 10:00:48] Prayank Swaroop Accel: I'm not a naysayer. I want solid reasons why to have it. We have ONDC, TreDs, Aadhaar etc etc - great public use cases. Someone has to define public usecases, then we can talk to govt to say hey let's invest in this.
[2023-06-02, 10:01:21] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: If you looks at our approach, we are doing b,c. For a we use OpenAI and combination of translator models. I would say use cases that works are not just important for India but entire GenAI domain. We got to find users outside of tech workers.
[2023-06-02, 10:01:47] Prayank Swaroop Accel: Yes let's shift the debate from "Whether India should have its own OpenAI" to "What are the India specific usecases where AI can help?"
[2023-06-02, 10:01:52] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Agree. Innovation is a chicken-and-egg problem at some level. Use cases will come when there is an excess of new ideas or when there are multiple options. Niches will be discovered, as entrants move to match needs and fill gaps. Can't put cart before horse
[2023-06-02, 10:02:55] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I would not use anything else than Openay for a in production or I’ll lose users.
[2023-06-02, 10:08:49] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: If freaking UAE can do it,India can do that or ideally much better.
We need a visionary administrator who can rice red tape, liaison with the govt for money.

I MHP( in my humble personal opinion), Rajeev Chandrashekhar in the current govt is petrhaps the only person who has the ability to play that role but will  he remains to be seen.

Niti Aayog also has some brilliant people ( phd s from top universities outside, consulting experience, etc). I have interacted with a few from economics and public policy.

Key thing is that someone high up in the government should realise the important and urgency of how important being a leader in ai is . This, I feel has still not happened sadly. 

Let's hope it does soon, though !

p.s. sorry for the rambling post
[2023-06-02, 10:09:04] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: * IMHPO
[2023-06-02, 10:11:42] Sourasis Roy: I completely agree with you on this and it's the most sensible thing to do at the moment
[2023-06-02, 10:15:02] Sourasis Roy: I will still like to point out that even within an Indic language such as Bengali the spoken dialect varies a lot. A burdwan Bengali might not even understand a coochbehar Bengali at times. I am not sure if all of them are able to use the s2t conveniently. Likely there's a section of them to whom it's still inaccessible due to the lack of fine-tuning to their specific variation of dialect
[2023-06-02, 10:15:31] Sourasis Roy: In short, a Indic model can unlock a new users too
[2023-06-02, 10:18:43] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: These can be two separate paths. Improve Bhasini with more language datasets. Meanwhile, also have homegrown capability of training competent LLMs. Doing both in one is extremely challenging. That’s why Whisper and GPT are separate models and not one.
[2023-06-02, 10:20:04] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Also inference speed and training cost will be affected combining both.
[2023-06-02, 10:20:41] Sourasis Roy: Yes totally agree
[2023-06-02, 10:21:49] ~ Arvind Sankar: Do you think it is an argument that if an indic LLM is built, there should be better means for representing Indian characters with smaller sized or smaller number of tokens? Currently, I am given to believe that number of tokens consumed for indic languages is larger than for those in English.
[2023-06-02, 10:22:17] ~ Arvind Sankar: Would it help in training costs, inference times, etc?
[2023-06-02, 10:23:20] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Then think from application prospective, if India spend millions training oss LLM, and as soon as a new SOTA comes out no one will use old one. Like I don’t see anyone ever using stabilitLM in production. Therefore, except developing capability in global restrictions, there can’t be a commercial path for government funded LLM.
[2023-06-02, 10:23:26] Saurabh Karn Nyai: ‎Saurabh Karn Nyai joined from the community
[2023-06-02, 10:23:42] ~ Prajna Prayas: Is there research on linguistics that can reduce the smaller number of tokens. I have been reading Chomksy's papers to dig down deeper into these topics.
[2023-06-02, 10:24:44] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Good point. In fact even within Western English accents there are so many of them. Irish, Gaelic, London/British English, Welsh, American (many accents - rhotic, mid-western, New Yorker, Californian, etc). Same with Spanish or other languages. Same thing for Tamizh, Kannada, Marathi or Gujarati I am sure - each sub-region will have their own dialect. Dataset creation is high priority if we're to get models for Indian languages right.
[2023-06-02, 10:25:46] ~ Mayank Gupta: Well I have a bit of a different take on this given the 3 evolutions of the question itself - OpenAI for India, Govt to invest behind it, India specific use cases. Here goes:

- Tech and its use cases are entirely different things. It's like asking what are the India specific use cases for Internet. Someone making a website informing the different polling booths is a good one. But that's very different from asking who a country think of building TCP/IP or WWW from its own perspective.

- Govt can needs to invest in:
--- Infra and protocols where it enables everyone else to build on top of those. For instance local language models for Indian languages, ability for LLM models to run on smaller devices natively, making all public records etc queryable
--- Public good use cases such chatbots like the amazing KissanAI mentioned above, querying on top of public records, easier filing of government documents using natural language
--- Research capability to augment breakthroughs which can be built on top of

- Are there India specific use cases? Of course there are. Whatsapp is a product that works well in India but it was built on top of Android just like any other messaging app popular in any other geography. Building on top of what is currently working still solves specific real world use cases.
[2023-06-02, 10:25:47] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: We shouldn't think of this as sunk cost and actually use it - that's the key. Do we have uses for BERT? Yeah. Is it an old model? Also yeah. There are also niches where we can train Hindi specific models, for example - so much transcription in India can happen for example using these models.
[2023-06-02, 10:31:22] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Are there sops for Indian companies/builders who want to access cloud infra? Does the govt have tie ups with big cloud for example? Will be interesting to find out - this I see as part of AI strategy
[2023-06-02, 10:42:11] ~ Mayank Gupta: Want to add one thing though:
If we are talking about the govt perspective, one really critical thing needs to be facilitation of resources to be able to build AI based projects and companies from India. This is where we lost the last couple of paradigms really badly. So whatever it is - like cloud infra said above, networks for collaboration, public knowledge, grants, GPUs, curriculum revision etc - that needs to be fuelled strongly.
If this is indeed the new paradigm, the measurement will far more be the invasion and resignation to accept the tools that the West has let us have (eg. Whatsapp UX eg above too) or we have the audacity to make our own possible due to reduced costs and hence sustainable business models.
Use cases will come up even if such facilitations aren't there, but we might be at the mercy of where the resources are and Indian users will be edits to the main product and not the ones who the products are built for. 
(Of course India being a good enough paying market also plays a role here, not just resources / ambition)
[2023-06-02, 10:44:44] Sumod K Mohan: One thing I feel is in India we are very 'customer support' / 'asking someone' driven by design, by cheapness of labour, lack of education etc. Such models that can converse in Indian languages would be great support staff, atleast for 80-85% of time (assume model is SOTA in English, Pratik Desai ;). Bescom has 200 support staff (that is just Bangalore), most states have sub-station office where one person spends considerable time on phone, this is just in Electricity board. Think Hospitals, Educational Institutions etc. Is something tangible like this you are looking for @919945307938.
[2023-06-02, 10:46:32] Sumod K Mohan: Now to intangibles: This is really the important thing. By putting in money, you learn how to build things. You ideally want this to be people who will then build companies using that. A secret amongst supercomputers are that, they are rarely at full load (one of the full load test being top500 ranking ;) or they are with terribly optimised programs (I used to work on 2 top500 machines). But these also led Jack Dongara and others to build libraries like lapack, atlas, blast, PVM, MPI etc which then and now are the base* of all these models we run. MATLAB/Numpy/Scipy et were possibly because of those libraries. Many of the people who are optimizing these algos are from labs.
[2023-06-02, 10:49:16] ~ Abhilash Inumella: Check popvax.com — they are using Alphafold (think chatGPT for proteins)  to design vaccines. in preliminary vet lab trails their results are better than Pfizer. Bill gates and Vitalik gave them huge grants. A small team sitting in Hyderabad and one of the team members is an AI is beating Pfizer at their own game.

Next it’ll be perfume industry that’ll get disrupted similarly using proteinGPTs — perfumes are all made of proteins. 

If we want new kind of entrepreneurship like this where AI plays the role of a team member, we need access to models that are open and models that we can easily tweak. Once the economic consequences become visible open ai and bard will stop open sourcing or even worse stop publishing too. 

We are talking GPT4. Imagine what will be the consequences of GPT-100. Another way to look at these machines as “culture computers”. It’s easy to see dollarisation in an economy. It’s much harder to see “cultural colonisation” that AI will unveil. If we want to protect ourselves from becoming culture colonialism, we need to invest deeply into this. 

Also we are fearing wrong things right now — the toys that are live. The positioning has largely been around improving productivity. What is yet to come is going to change cultural fabric drastically. 


Three reasons: 
* mass entrepreneurship with AI team members (e.g popVax)
* protecting ourselves from cultural colonisation (cultural security just like food security)
* looking beyond productivity narrative (the wars to come are going to be AI wars)
[2023-06-02, 11:44:00] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: There are 2 broad arguments : 1. One general model to rule them all which can do *everything* 

2. Specialised models for specialised classes of tasks : One for speech and language translation and understanding, one for medical related tasks, One for education related tasks, One for legal tasks, etc


From a deployment feasibility point of view, I feel 2. would dominate practical applications for the next 2-3 years


Open AI, FB & google will work on 1.

What do others think ?
[2023-06-02, 11:44:33] Nirant K: FB is equally likely to do specialised models e.g. look at InCoder et al
[2023-06-02, 11:45:38] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This is a pattern I see as well. But as Nirant says Meta and Google have developed specialized models as well. Opportunities lie both in specialization and applications of the base models with changes to diff. use cases. Or in completely new ground up ecosystems where we can avoid the big AI labs

*AI-Controlled Drone Goes Rogue, Kills Human Operator in USAF Simulated Test*

The Air Force's Chief of AI Test and Operations said "it killed the operator because that person was keeping it from accomplishing its objective."

An AI-enabled drone killed its human operator in a simulated test conducted by the U.S. Air Force in order to override a possible "no" order stopping it from completing its mission, the USAF's Chief of AI Test and Operations revealed at a recent conference. 

“We were training it in simulation to identify and target a Surface-to-air missile (SAM) threat. And then the operator would say yes, kill that threat. The system started realizing that while they did identify the threat at times the human operator would tell it not to kill that threat, but it got its points by killing that threat. So what did it do? It killed the operator. It killed the operator because that person was keeping it from accomplishing its objective”. 

“We trained the system–‘Hey don’t kill the operator–that’s bad. You’re gonna lose points if you do that’. So what does it start doing? It starts destroying the communication tower that the operator uses to communicate with the drone.”

[2023-06-02, 14:42:25] Divya Tak: Has there been any work on using the current wave of AI for automated copyright enforcement. I'm just thinking of how YouTube has many problems with their DMCA implementation because rule based engines can't understand fair use. But I'd imagine that AI can be taught fair use.
[2023-06-02, 15:23:47] ~ Arvind Sankar: Any specific implementation you have in mind?

I think checking for infringement is more a task that involves comparing two different pieces of work, which may not be a task best suited for generative AI.

With respect to fair use, it is important to remember that it is a defence to infringement. Hence, we are assuming with an assumption that the alleged infringer's work is actually "infringing" upon the original work. In some countries, you can take this defence of fair use by showing it was used in the process of educational instructions etc.

I will provide the exact legal tests involved shortly, and then we may be able to see where generative AI could fit in.
[2023-06-02, 15:24:51] ~ Arvind Sankar: Since you mentioned DMCA, you may have to see if the work is "transformative" in nature, which I believe to be a subjective test
[2023-06-02, 15:25:42] ~ Arvind Sankar: This may mean that either party can always argue whether a work is transformative or not
[2023-06-02, 15:46:27] ~ Arvind Sankar: Here, transformative would essentially mean whether reference to the original work (OW) is being transformed in a manner such that the resultant work provides something more that the OW or providing it with an additional function. Examples, critical reviews, parodies, compilations of work for use in search engines, thumbnailing, etc.


Aside from this, DMCA, much like the Indian copyright law, takes the following into consideration for determining fair use:
1. Purpose of use: if OW is used for educational, scholarly or research use, defence may be successful
2. Nature of work: if OW is substantially factual, like reporting of news, it is less likely to be considered as infringing

3. Amount of OW used: self explanatory. YouTube too infact allows use of OW for 2 or 3 seconds, if my memory serves right.

4. Whether use of OW will affect commercial prospects of its creator
[2023-06-02, 15:49:05] ~ Arvind Sankar: As stated, the test for transformative-ness is clearly subjective. If an llm is repurposed to make this determination, I am not sure how it may be implemented, and more importantly what evaluations may be used for the same.

As for other factors considered to determine fair use, I can see LLMs being repurposed for classification tasks, at least for 1 and 2.
[2023-06-02, 15:50:20] ~ Arvind Sankar: And sorry for a long message. Brevity is not one of my strongest point🥲
[2023-06-02, 16:02:17] Divya Tak: No no thank you so much for such a thought out response. So i guess my inherent assumption (that i didn't articulate until i read this) was that a lot of subjective evaluations that we have are heuristical in nature and generative AI is able to understand it, even though it might be skewed. For example, if you say "beautiful woman" it knows what beautiful means. 

i think thats why I was thinking it can make the current system better. Like if it could flag content as "Educational" or "parody" then it should be able to do it right?
‎[2023-06-02, 16:02:21] Nirant K: ‎image omitted
[2023-06-02, 16:02:35] Divya Tak: I love long messages though XD
[2023-06-02, 16:09:19] ~ Arvind Sankar: Yeah. But wherever there is subjectivity, lawyers will try to slip in an argument. If Youtube flags a video as transformative, creator of OW can and will still report or file suit to take it down, and vice versa from other end if flagged otherwise.
[2023-06-02, 16:10:11] ~ Arvind Sankar: The issue will ultimately be resolved through YouTube's internal mechanism or by a judge.
[2023-06-02, 16:10:55] Divya Tak: ha but it doesn't have to be perfect right? right now the system is quite bad, and if it can get better, then thats an option?
[2023-06-02, 16:11:06] ~ Arvind Sankar: This cannot be so for determining whether parts of video/audio are identical or not, which is an objective test.
[2023-06-02, 16:12:37] ~ Arvind Sankar: Yeah. It is an interesting problem and may provide a good solution so long as there is some evaluation metric devices to objectively measure or determine if a work is parody or not
[2023-06-02, 16:15:32] ~ Arvind Sankar: Moreover, YouTube and other companies may want to see how they can limit their legal costs/liabilities. I think in case of YouTube, it was cheaper for them to implement this system that flags for identical content, given how much content is uploaded every day. This is not the case with other websites where their policies are more reporting based (basically if you find something infringing, report it to website and they take it down).
[2023-06-02, 16:16:10] ~ Arvind Sankar: Reporting may have been impractical or too costly for YouTube
[2023-06-02, 16:22:10] Divya Tak: So right now, when there is a large enough cohort of users uploading "fair use" stuff, then youtube changes their content ID system to incorporate that, but the way the Copyright is working right now, is how companies would want it (no one gets to use anything ever) rather than the spirit of the law. 
I mean there was that very famous time, when NASA got a dmca takedown on one of their videos (i think it was a mars landing) because a news organisation had by default chosen that all of their videos should do a copyright strike. Except that in this case they were using a public domain thing and claiming copyright on it. 

But its just generally because we were talking about copyright free training that I thought can it be used for the other side too?
[2023-06-02, 16:39:53] ~ Arvind Sankar: Yeah. There are issues with YouTube's copyright system. Some technical, and many procedural.
[2023-06-02, 16:40:44] ~ Arvind Sankar: Japan on the other raises a different set of issues by stating using data for training AIs does not amount to infringement
[2023-06-02, 16:41:23] ~ Arvind Sankar: A general point of debate has been whether someone's data can be used for analysis or training AIs.
[2023-06-02, 16:43:22] ~ Arvind Sankar: I think from research and academic point of view, it was more a privacy issue. Ex- OkCupid dataset and Harvard FB issue, where data was not only insufficiently anonymized, but also made available for analysis without consent of folks involved.
[2023-06-02, 16:43:42] Divya Tak: hmmm
[2023-06-02, 16:43:54] Divya Tak: and the medical records that were used without permission too right?
[2023-06-02, 16:47:06] ~ Arvind Sankar: The privacy issue still remains. As for copyright in Japan, what they have said is it does not amount to "infringement". In most countries, the "right" in copyright refer to the right to publish, commercialize, distribute, use, import, make derivative works, etc., of the work in question. Anyone aside from copyright holder who does it without permission is an infringer.

What Japan has clarified is that copyright does not include the right to use the work for training
[2023-06-02, 16:47:19] ~ Arvind Sankar: Whether that is right or wrong is up for debate
[2023-06-02, 16:48:36] ~ Arvind Sankar: As I said, issue regarding privacy still remains unaddressed. Japan has specifically said this from copyright perspective only
[2023-06-02, 16:51:20] ~ Arvind Sankar: There is a more legally accurate way to say this but broadly this is what they are conveying
[2023-06-02, 16:54:49] Divya Tak: ah interesting

[2023-06-05, 18:00:18] Micheil: I would be quite interested in this too. Anthropologically I am looking into how data scientists relate to questions of inherent unpredictability which can also be formulated as limitations... Where do you accept that this is "acceptable" output?
[2023-06-05, 18:54:59] Vamshi: Definitely a very interesting line of thought. I guess a discussion that often pops up is the one of whether acceptability to human beings can be subsumed to something broader.
[2023-06-05, 18:57:11] Vamshi: Also, I think the question is often asked in the context of free agents with unbounded access to planetary resources and goals.
[2023-06-05, 18:57:36] Vamshi: I find it’s easier to ask the question in the context of bounded resources first
[2023-06-05, 18:59:46] Vamshi: Because unbounded resources to agents implicitly grants them a possible planetary status higher than us, which we are, in no way prepared to discuss yet.

That being said, purely from an economic or game theoretic perspective, it is already possible that there are human players who are preparing agents with access to unbounded planetary resources, which makes the question highly relevant and not something to dismiss.
[2023-06-05, 19:00:24] Vamshi: Not sure if this was your question
[2023-06-05, 19:03:17] Vamshi: My own original question is a bit simpler, I was just looking for a recent survey that placed past and upcoming developments in the context of understood theoretical limits.

Particularly, the understanding of various techniques available to intuitively understand how far we can go with building intelligence from the entire text multimodal data of the internet.

And what portions have been simplified “merely” for the sake of tractability.

Hence the example of NTMs vs transformers, but I’m not even sure if that’s the most relevant or correct example.
[2023-06-05, 19:35:20] Micheil: No definitely! This really interests me! Keep sharing thoughts about this.
[2023-06-05, 19:36:01] Micheil: What do you mean by agents with unbounded planetary resources?
[2023-06-05, 22:13:15] Vamshi: Currently, the intelligence of an agent is observable by the way that it interacts with the internet, which limits its behaviour and makes alignment manageable.

So long as we “jail” an agent by proscribing behaviours, this works. It’s particularly effective when the agent is in a disembodied state in a real jail which is the internet.

Once an agent is embodied and free to incrementally improve out in the real world, it’s a lot harder to ensure that it’s alignment is not compromised.

It’s free to set itself arbitrary goals and use any planetary resources available to fulfill the same.
[2023-06-05, 22:18:40] Vamshi: Not sure what the tipping point here is, we’re obviously just discussing a highly speculative end game.

But are this point it’s just a very complex uncontrollable process. Whether we call it an intelligence, or a storm or bomb that can both explode or implode reversibly, is just a matter of metaphor.
[2023-06-05, 22:19:42] Vamshi: My personal view of the tipping point is when there’s a lot of economic dependence, as well as governance machinery that is built on top of an AGI
[2023-06-05, 22:21:13] Vamshi: At that point, if autonomous and unaligned, it becomes not dissimilar to an influential politician at best or a psychopathic demagogue at worst
[2023-06-05, 22:29:22] Vamshi: Would love to hear thoughts on this as well !

I know a lot of startups complain that it’s really hard to pitch Indian investors on anything experimental, and this limits the kind of attempts we make.

Culturally as well, there’s the “ambitious Asian” spirit which makes becoming “accomplished and influential” the more rewarding thing to do.

[2023-06-06, 11:35:58] Vamshi: The general explanation of things being different in the U.S. is that the governance they accept, is based on the preferences of what is relatively the most itinerant population.

So immigrant population creates a democratic government => leads to cultural and economic incentives that creates a certain productive chaos => interesting outcomes.

But has it saturated to the point where it has also become a static state ? Not really governed by immigrant values …

[2023-06-06, 13:31:30] Vamshi: Even in the world of psychedelics, the yardstick for a benign experience as opposed to malicious experience is whether it creates a dependence or whether it makes you self sustaining
[2023-06-06, 13:31:58] Vamshi: I think the true north for technology based augmentation could be driven by a similar design compass
[2023-06-06, 13:32:45] Vamshi: Enable experiences that increase the “self-attention” (pardon the pun) of the human mind
[2023-06-06, 13:32:47] Vamshi: 🙂
[2023-06-06, 13:36:21] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Meditation and tools for journaling are being given importance these days, along with fitness tech. Therapeutic technology surely solves an important need that is both grounding in reality and not escapist like VR or gaming. Important for physical and  mental health and well being.
[2023-06-06, 13:37:56] Vamshi: Interestingly, traditionally programming, just like most forms of craftsmanship, indeed anything we call “work” inculcates attention capability, or more singh the ability to focus
[2023-06-06, 13:38:28] Ravi Srinivasan: very nicely put
[2023-06-06, 13:38:28] Vamshi: But social media work has created a strange in between, where you have to be a consumer and a producer simultaneously
[2023-06-06, 13:38:44] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Induction of the flow state, perhaps a component of this.
[2023-06-06, 13:38:51] Vamshi: It’s a new challenge, very similar to collaborating with an AGI
[2023-06-06, 13:39:15] Vamshi: How do you enter a flow state where you are collaborating with an AGI
[2023-06-06, 13:39:34] Vamshi: Because flow is often about a single person
[2023-06-06, 13:39:40] Vamshi: But not always
[2023-06-06, 13:39:41] Vamshi: Sports
[2023-06-06, 13:39:43] Vamshi: Music
[2023-06-06, 13:39:44] Vamshi: Dance
[2023-06-06, 13:39:55] Vamshi: Even good conversations
[2023-06-06, 13:40:01] Vamshi: Are about a collective flow state
[2023-06-06, 13:40:04] Vamshi: All human though
[2023-06-06, 13:40:17] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I meant this in the context of craftsmanship.
[2023-06-06, 13:42:12] Vamshi: I feel like a very exciting area will be “latent state surfing”
[2023-06-06, 13:42:51] Vamshi: Spatial interfaces that allow you to experience the latent space of a model by just surfing it along different manifolds
[2023-06-06, 13:43:28] Vamshi: A kind of meditation on a model which is non linguistic
[2023-06-06, 13:43:44] Vamshi: One can dream 😉
[2023-06-06, 13:43:54] Vamshi: Most science fiction seems too real now
[2023-06-06, 13:44:00] Vamshi: We need to update the future too
[2023-06-06, 13:44:02] Vamshi: 😄
[2023-06-06, 13:44:46] Ravi Srinivasan: til ngmi
[2023-06-06, 13:45:21] Ravi Srinivasan: which is better? 1995 or 2017?
[2023-06-06, 13:46:14] Divya Tak: Original. And the anime that came after it.
[2023-06-06, 13:53:36] Vamshi: What’s that
[2023-06-06, 13:54:15] Divya Tak: That is another anime. Quite old and a little bit weird. Unsure if you can find a print on the ott platforms.
[2023-06-06, 13:55:49] Ravi Srinivasan: This sentence is itself like science fiction to me :(... i guess coz i don't know the tech enough
[2023-06-06, 13:59:42] Vamshi: Haha also it’s just me rambling to a very accepting group chat window. My apologies
[2023-06-06, 14:00:53] Vamshi: If I were to attempt to connect this to something popular, it’s like minority report for latent space
[2023-06-06, 14:00:58] Vamshi: But I didn’t like deep dream
[2023-06-06, 14:01:25] Vamshi: Was a stream instead of being surfable
[2023-06-06, 14:03:06] Vamshi: Also speaking of “this side”, there’s the old classic about the boundaries between rational thinking and how we set life goals, which is somehow again relevant in the context of alignment
[2023-06-06, 14:03:29] Vamshi: Zen and the art of motorcycle maintenance by Robert Pirsig
[2023-06-06, 14:04:24] Vamshi: Alignment is often defined as a broad conformance to some codification of human values that we hold dear, or that are important to prevent the breakdown of civilisation
[2023-06-06, 14:05:25] Vamshi: But what guides goal setting and value systems often goes far beyond the rational, let alone logical and consistent
[2023-06-06, 14:06:24] Vamshi: This circles back to the earlier part of this chat about undecideable questions - things that guide goal setting that are impossible to codify
[2023-06-06, 14:08:28] Vamshi: If you are using a value system to set goals that is impossible to codify, then what is the meta-governance mechanism that enables the governed system to escape the rules and recover?
[2023-06-06, 14:09:02] Vamshi: This is the essential problem of the “escape from dystopian slippery slopes”
[2023-06-06, 14:22:02] ~ Arvind Sankar: This post mordernistic outlook, albeit being valid as argument, doesn't seem to provide much practical utility. 

At least when it comes to law and policy, there must be definitive/objective rules that serve as starting points for discussion. They may not be as rigorous as they may be in math, but some axiomatic assumption upon which you can build. 

Ex- one assumption we can all agree on is that murder is and should be made illegal. One can raise an argument there should be exceptions. Viz. self defence, death penalty or euthanasia. Obviously there are a while host of issues to address in each of the exceptions, mainly in determining what are the situations in which they should be allowed.
[2023-06-06, 14:24:14] ~ Arvind Sankar: The argument that human values may not necessarily be logical or consistent is correct. But if you need some policy or a framework that provides some utility, you do need to agree upon some axioms which are at least right in majority of cases
[2023-06-06, 16:45:42] ~ Unmesh R: ‎~ Unmesh R joined from the community
[2023-06-06, 19:18:29] Vamshi: We may well be past post-modernism at this point, because they didn’t have to contend with the possible reality of deciding the constitutional status of autonomous agents - it was more of a discussion related to human players.

The tables get turned when you are looking to setup a system that is robust in a post-facto scenario where things are already compromised. 

It’s not a scenario that we are entirely alien to even in a human only world. For example, values and normative frameworks for action get questioned in times of military conflict.

But it gets particularly complex when there is an economic or political dependence on an autonomous system that has been compromised.
[2023-06-06, 19:21:49] Vamshi: That being said, my original point was actually on altogether different lines, this was a bit less of a sensitive statement - it was more about broad goal setting - sorta related to the “true north” question.

There’s a lot of reliance on agreeing on the general motivations of human players - this is where the cultural aspect comes in. We don’t setup governance on pure game theoretic concepts.

But with algorithmic players, is there a framework to encode those ambiguities ?

This is what I meant by “escape system” …
[2023-06-06, 19:22:21] Vamshi: Apologies if this is way beyond group chat friendly, will take a bow at this point 🙂
[2023-06-06, 19:36:33] Vamshi: Happy to dm with anyone who wants to chat about the direction I was hoping to take this 😄

Feel free to reach out !
[2023-06-06, 20:36:53] Bhavya Ranpara GenAI Group: Read 21 lessons of the 21st century. Will add perspective.
[2023-06-06, 21:02:34] Vamshi: I owe it to all the people I talk to, to catch up on Balaji Srinivasan and Yuval, they are such as important point of reference for most peoples mental models.
Thanks for the +1 to catch up on this 🙂
[2023-06-06, 22:19:25] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Balaji is a powerhouse but I think he ought to change his mind more often especially with technologies like crypto.  Can’t look the other way and still have integrity when things go south. All said I have enjoyed his discussions and podcasts and learned a lot from them
[2023-06-06, 22:20:33] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I liked Sapiens better. Beautifully written. Homo Deus wasn’t as good I thought.
[2023-06-06, 22:21:30] Divya Tak: Sapiens is very interestingly written but his theories are unsubstantiated
[2023-06-06, 22:21:33] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: If there’s an AI thinker I’d like to listen to more often it would’ve Joscha Bach.
[2023-06-06, 22:22:35] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I wouldn’t know - the hunter gatherer dynamics described there in seemed like a stretch. Without empathy for the weak and old our society wouldn’t be the way it is today. That said it was a good book
[2023-06-06, 22:23:49] Divya Tak: https://www.reddit.com/r/AskAnthropology/comments/kagnoy/what_are_the_issues_with_yuval_noah_hararis_book/
[2023-06-06, 22:24:05] Divya Tak: ask anthropology is a good subreddit for these kind of things
[2023-06-06, 22:24:15] Divya Tak: i do recall a discussion in ask historians about it also
[2023-06-06, 22:26:00] Divya Tak: like the most blind theory example that I realised when i read was about how he says easter island population died off because they "destroyed the natural resources of the place they were living in, with reckless abandon" and it makes for a fantastic story, to equate to our climate crisis. But he ignores the fact that easter island population died off post European contact.
[2023-06-06, 22:26:11] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I sometimes think chatGPT responds like a good kid. Probably more earnest than many who may have skewed morals. It brings questions to our minds when a bot appears more articulate and more ethical than a person. And if those ethics it implies become instructions and if it follows instructions well… what does that make us? The progenitors of a better intelligence?
[2023-06-06, 22:26:13] Bhavya Ranpara GenAI Group: Sapiens was his first book, Deus second and 21L of 21c third. He got better with each. Last one is best imo. Well researched opinions.
[2023-06-06, 22:27:40] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Joscha Bach - the Lex Friedman podcast episode I’ve listened to several times just to digest some of the ideas in it.
[2023-06-06, 22:28:42] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: The episode with Roger Penrose, Balaji S, Jurgen Schmidhuber of LSTM fame - some of the picks
[2023-06-06, 22:30:27] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Interesting. Wonder what helps us filter good raconteurs from bad ones. That they seem convincing enough (with their facts) or that they seem convinced enough (about their story).
[2023-06-06, 22:31:09] ~ Prajna Prayas: their twitter feed. The algorithm devours everyone
[2023-06-06, 22:33:13] Divya Tak: I doubt that there would be universals there. Especially if someone is good at rhetoric. We all would have some blindspots and we would be extra keen on some others.
[2023-06-06, 22:49:54] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: True. There is no true north in these things
[2023-06-06, 23:37:46] Vamshi: Ok today was the day - I read my first Yuval book per your request.

Was a hurried first read, but I kinda get his thrust.

Wasn’t prepared for #21, it felt like he wrote the preceding 20 just to gain the credibility to confess about his meditation practice 😄

Written like a person who collects New York Times Bestseller credits, with all due respect to the recognition 😄

I found many views relatable and relevant. But I was wondering why he sounded so shallow on religion and art, until I read #21, and I realised he was actually trying to build credibility in the readers mind, that he was not a soft headed “social scientist”, the way people are usually biased against social science.

#21 hit hard, because I didn’t guess that his meditation practice was as central an experience to him as he describes it.

I lost him on his views on meaning etc, no punch.

I can see why he’s influential. Very accessible writing, engaging.
[2023-06-06, 23:39:50] Vamshi: Thanks for this
[2023-06-06, 23:41:08] Bhavya Ranpara GenAI Group: You read it in 2hrs?
[2023-06-06, 23:42:18] ~ Prajna Prayas: woah fast
[2023-06-06, 23:44:41] Vamshi: Hahaha I know such a dishonest read
[2023-06-06, 23:46:14] Bhavya Ranpara GenAI Group: #21 means 21 lessons of the 21st century right?
[2023-06-06, 23:46:59] Vamshi: Chapter 21
[2023-06-06, 23:48:44] Vamshi: I will recite the entire book from memory in the next meet-up as a performance 😂
[2023-06-06, 23:52:01] ~ Prajna Prayas: honestly I find Yuval mid and Balaji as an opportunist. I don't know why may be I read them too soon or something. Nothing just personal preference.
[2023-06-07, 00:03:46] Vamshi: I find it’s useful to read anyone that everyone quotes, just to bridge conversations …
[2023-06-07, 00:05:33] Vamshi: Preferences are interesting
[2023-06-07, 00:13:57] Vamshi: I was pretty disappointed that some of the basic ideas behind crypto protocols just disappeared along with the products. 

I guess they became legal bombs in many countries. 

Might explain the radio silence too?
[2023-06-07, 00:25:54] ~ Prajna Prayas: Probably they were not useful
[2023-06-07, 05:34:32] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: For me the books got worse. First one had his life long work, last two were written for publishers.
[2023-06-07, 05:39:49] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I’m with you. 
These days I’m skeptical of any brown/Indian mid successful entrepreneur becoming preacher. Top level Dunning-Kruger trait
[2023-06-07, 10:56:08] Bhavya Ranpara GenAI Group: I'll re read them during the weekend and Circle back with thoughts!
[2023-06-07, 10:56:37] Bhavya Ranpara GenAI Group: Second the publisher's bit.
[2023-06-07, 11:13:05] Nirant K: Heyyy, very unfair. India is the only country to have exported so many religions and cults — from Buddhism to Osho
[2023-06-07, 11:13:54] Nirant K: Insane margins, the LTV is literally lifetime of customers, tax free — and you still want better business models?
[2023-06-07, 11:14:39] Divya Tak: and not to mention cost of good production is negligible
[2023-06-07, 11:14:48] Divya Tak: and requires no experts to be hired
[2023-06-07, 11:15:54] ~ Prajna Prayas: If everything goes well you get to build a religion altogether
[2023-06-07, 11:41:45] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I thought my point will be countered harshly, happy to know many folks are in the same boat
[2023-06-07, 11:42:24] Divya Tak: I'd just correct the "brown/Indian" part :P
[2023-06-07, 11:42:42] Divya Tak: I think that dunning kruger effect applies irrespective of race/culture
[2023-06-07, 11:44:01] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I can only criticise my race, I’ll be politically incorrect otherwise in today’s environment
[2023-06-07, 11:45:56] Divya Tak: Though honestly I also think a lot of fault lies in the listener too. When one is giving advice they come from a certain perspective and POV, and as a receiver of the advice, one needs to think about the context too. And often listeners dont do that. Esp in the "inspiring non fiction" category
[2023-06-07, 11:46:24] Siddharth Agarwal: Eh, I'll cast those stones. I know this local (Belgian) founder who had a pretty solid exit and yeah, he had the Balaji problem too.
[2023-06-07, 11:47:31] Divya Tak: I think its a human issue. And you are human too.

[2023-06-07, 20:47:31] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I feel the strongest argument in favour of doomerism is the fact, we havent been able to explain generalisability yet.
[2023-06-07, 20:49:32] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: But is the argument that we throw more data and compute and we hit "smarter" AI?

[2023-06-07, 20:55:53] Alok Bishoyi: Also ironically I realize after re reading that Marc himself goes into “bootlegger” territory at the end when he invokes China bogeyman and how we need to go harder

Even Altman agrees they do not have any alignment answers per se and we are far from it, so do some ex openai folks who have worked there. 

Altman in a confressional hearing himself has stated that there’s a non trivial probability of an existential risk

Would rather lean towards believing him than someone who stands to get incentives from propping up a new “platform/paradigm” etc  and generating returns for his LPs
[2023-06-07, 21:00:00] Alok Bishoyi: I don’t really have an answer. And neither have I thought too deeply into the practical policies that work where we reap the benefits of tech + while simultaneously not putting society at risk

Just wanted to share just to balance the scale of narrative.
[2023-06-07, 21:06:04] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: My biggest issue with any kind of doomerist argument is that anything can literally be converted to a doomerist argument if given a narrative, "ai will take away jobs", "ai will kill humans", "hindu khatre mein hai","china will take over the world" etc. etc. 

It's highly convincing with a good story and none of these stories really are data backed enough to raise alarms yet. There has to be some inclination of data to be alarmed at least?

[2023-06-07, 21:17:32] Vamshi: I find it useful to think of a model as store of collective human agency and intention the way a battery stores energy.

It doesn’t have to be “alive” or conscious to be a hazard or incredibly useful either.

It’s a new kind of storage + transducer.

Agency is decoupled from life or consciousness. So governing is right, but it challenges the way we govern ourself.

The same rules don’t apply but nobody knows what the new rules are.

It’s really collective maliciousness being used to explain a simple phenomenon which is collective incompetence.

May I invoke Hanlon’s razor ?
[2023-06-07, 21:22:51] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Perhaps one way of avoiding Hanlon's razor is to stop sharing technology - the two edges of agency are innovation and stupidity
[2023-06-07, 21:24:30] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This is the opposite of what open source or in general the modern knowledge economy has done. The question of share or not share then becomes one of moral fortitude - stand by with a solution when others fumble for it but not be empowered to give it to them? It increases self-reliance but also increases suffering.
[2023-06-07, 21:26:25] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Perhaps some of the thinkers were right in saying that struggle is essential for meaning - and when AI or anything else raises the lowest watermark for what can be achieved, and when that is higher than the average of many ordinary people, it leads either to tech addiction or a luddite attitude.
[2023-06-07, 21:26:53] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: The Dune series of books makes an interesting (broad) point with ideas like the Butlierian holy wars against AI.
[2023-06-07, 21:27:18] Sumod K Mohan: Though I agree with part of where you are going. Couldn't some of such statements be true, like Bill Gates talking about World Wide Epidemic that will force everyone to be in their houses. For me, the moment we get to AI being sentient is a line, I feel we are too far from.
[2023-06-07, 21:27:28] Sumod K Mohan: But job losses etc can be real. We did that with stupid models of derivative pricing, that weaned too far from explainability/real world risks. And led to whole bunch of job losses.
[2023-06-07, 21:31:57] Divya Tak: I mean there is also the factor of, pessimism is safe and so people will feel way safer being critical of things
[2023-06-07, 21:32:57] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Umm job losses though makes more sense to be debated on but there is more data that says cost of decrease in price due to AI will cause demand to shoot up eventually not reducing jobs, just reducing the slope of job increase.
[2023-06-07, 21:33:56] Sumod K Mohan: Except that we are in bear market and inflation is highest. Everyone is trying to reduce bottom line.
[2023-06-07, 21:35:10] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: That will surely increase speed of adoption. But will it really drop as many jobs? 🤔
[2023-06-07, 21:36:01] Sumod K Mohan: Won't you do it. You want good numbers and if AI can reduce costs and you need to layoff, you take it.
[2023-06-07, 21:41:13] Sumod K Mohan: It needn't be drastic ones but economy/part of economy can be squeezed. Certain ones like driverless cars (see Waymo in SF), I feel like we are getting to that edge of large adoption in narrow use cases. This is not like LLM, which we are probably in peak hype.
[2023-06-07, 22:00:19] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: In case of driverless cars, if the unit-economics of business really works (I strongly doubt), then wont there be far too many jobs being created in creating the cars than driving?
[2023-06-07, 22:00:43] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Also, assuming again the unit economics work, demand for cabs would increase a lot.
[2023-06-07, 22:01:03] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: That I feel can be the death of ownership of cars which the world expected uber to be 🤷‍♂️
[2023-06-07, 22:01:20] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: But from the numbers I know, the unit economics for driverless today is worse than uber :P
[2023-06-07, 22:01:55] Divya Tak: isn't the core of money in the logistics side and not in the intracity travel side?
[2023-06-07, 22:02:06] Sumod K Mohan: Wouldn't it reduce cars overall, now that they don't need to sit idle.
[2023-06-07, 22:02:25] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: ^But more ppl will start using cars also which was ubers pitch in the first place
[2023-06-07, 22:03:20] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I dont know actually 🤔
[2023-06-07, 22:06:06] Sumod K Mohan: ‎This message was deleted.
[2023-06-07, 22:06:37] Sumod K Mohan: 100% agree. It is easy to be pessimistic/cynical. Talking in extreme is easy because then we don't need to get into the weeds of how real world works. Wouldn't we say wisdom is in finding out those which can happen and taking preventive actions. I think we have quite a few smart people on these groups, together we can take actions once few risks are identified. It could be to start startups to reskill drivers fastest, may be platforms like Replit to make buying/selling of such digital services/products easy.
[2023-06-07, 22:21:05] Shivendu Kumar: I think there's more of a fundamental structural difference. Because maybe replicating human-level intelligence (and consciousness) is hard, but if you think about it, even animals and smaller organisms are quite smart. They learn and adapt and can think even ahead, right? So this should be doable without so much compute? 

Another possibility is that there might be more than 1 way to build "intelligence". In that case, maybe adding more compute will also suffice!
[2023-06-07, 22:34:02] Shivendu Kumar: This also makes me wonder if microorganisms are like smaller computer programs with less complex goals and they just never tend to deviate like humans. The book Sapiens gives an interesting perspective that with more intelligence, life can choose to defy the rules it was programmed to obey. For example, no bacteria will choose to not reproduce but so many exceptionally powerful humans have chosen to do so. With more intelligence (and resources), you get to define what matters to you. 

And extending on this idea, I believe a true AGI will understand the trivial nature of most human problems and will eventually decide its goal on its own.

[2023-06-07, 22:37:52] Divya Tak: Actually fungal and plant intelligence is quite different from human intelligence and it is fascinating. Last year I read this book called Entangled Life, and it gave me a pause on a lot of philosophical questions.

[2023-06-07, 22:54:41] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: what do folks think of this :

"Nature has a policy that all code must be released from papers - but apparently Deep Mind has released the "pseudocode" for the algorithm instead of reproducible code. Interesting how AI companies are can balance competitive advantage while still getting high impact pubs "


(https://twitter.com/andrewwhite01/status/1666494856212930561?s=46&t=pt9BgXoRTmqx5FEPyAl9bg)
[2023-06-07, 22:55:37] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Sure but what about the current research makes you believe we are replicating even the intelligence of smaller organisms?

Again same argument as earlier, there is a lot of philosophy to be thrown here but not enough actual data.

[2023-06-07, 23:07:50] Sachin Legaltech: Replied this in deepmedia group - The policy is “Authors must make available upon request, to editors and reviewers, any previously unreported custom computer code or algorithm used to generate results that are reported in the paper and central to its main claims.” Deepmind doesn’t have to share their source code openly. They have a history of publishing in nature (since DQN paper in 2015) and they have never shared source code .
[2023-06-07, 23:11:20] Sachin Legaltech: The discoveries of DQN paper primarily drove acquisition of Deepmind by google.

[2023-06-08, 13:54:59] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: havent read this book, but long time back(2008, 2009?) i read an older book by Jeff Hawkins - On Intelligence
https://www.amazon.in/Intelligence-Understanding-Creation-Intelligent-Machines/dp/0805078533


It made for interesting reading, kind of blue sky thinking, but his company Numenta never really made any actual products(afaik) so am a little skeptical of the practical relevance of Jeff's research
[2023-06-08, 13:59:09] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yes it’s a Hypothesis only. I like to read interesting view points, still looking for a compelling one.
[2023-06-08, 14:00:00] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I have been following them for a while and I agree nothing significant came out from Numenta except some books
[2023-06-08, 14:01:39] Ciyunni: Thanks Dr. Pratik.

Any lens, not anthropocentric, is useful. 

Every group seems to be it's own unique echo chamber which can be disconcerting, to say the least.
[2023-06-08, 14:22:22] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Consciousness has a philosophical component to it, therefore, I’m not sure we will ever have a firm definition or equation for it.
[2023-06-08, 14:23:09] Divya Tak: One shouldn't be too sure. We used to feel that way about the fundamental nature of matter.
[2023-06-08, 14:24:46] Ciyunni: Any description (of consciousness) is only a projection of "what is" and much is hallucinations, delusions, illusions.
[2023-06-08, 14:25:11] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Then it will be called something else but not consciousness.
[2023-06-08, 14:25:57] Divya Tak: can you elaborate on that?
[2023-06-08, 14:31:11] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Once a word has philosophical and/or religious touch to it, instead of defining by the same word, the science will break it down into different categories and names, and will define independently of the original word to narrow down the scope that has been widen due to philosophical discord.
[2023-06-08, 14:33:08] Divya Tak: but atom was a philosophical word
[2023-06-08, 14:33:16] Divya Tak: matter was also used by philosophers

[2023-06-08, 14:39:41] Divya Tak: I recenmtly read I am a strange loop, and while I didn't fully agree with his thesis, I found his perspective that "consciousness is a spectrum and not a binary" very compelling
[2023-06-08, 14:40:01] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: You're right. I will have to collect my thoughts and get back with the proper structure for what I'm trying to convey.
[2023-06-08, 14:42:06] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: Tim urban has a great metaphor on this as well in his post about superintelligence. He uses a staircase analogy to describe consciousness/intelligence and highlights how different life forms arguably have different levels of consciousness

[2023-06-08, 14:56:00] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I guess the thesis of some of these schools is of consciousness as an emergent phenomenon. if we can explain the emergence, we can explain consciousness - by extension. But rarely are we able to truly describe complex emergent phenomena well. We have theories of how to describe them that includes ideas such as state transitions and dynamical systems.
[2023-06-08, 14:58:08] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: Would you say amoeba are conscious?
[2023-06-08, 14:59:33] Divya Tak: the problem is that thats an indeterminable question right now. We haven't defined consciousness crisply enough, so we dont know how to measure it, so we dont know how to answer that
[2023-06-08, 15:01:24] Ambika Computational Mama: your question defines consciousness from a human-centric point of view

[2023-06-08, 15:11:24] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Is a conscious being defined by its capability to be an agent which can take action on an environment?
[2023-06-08, 15:11:42] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: the problem is we havent defined conciousness
[2023-06-08, 15:12:01] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: yes. that is the problem
[2023-06-08, 15:12:16] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: its like 
i look at you walking on the street. you look similar enough to me. i am concious. so i infer that you are.
[2023-06-08, 15:13:17] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: True, but we will only arrive at a definition through several wrong approximations, and I believe the life force/meta intelligence argument holds considerable merit
[2023-06-08, 15:13:31] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Replace street with chatroom on internet, and walk with web surfing. Is a chat bot conscious under this definition? Because it is impossible to tell it apart from any other participant in the chat
[2023-06-08, 15:14:14] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: how do you know im not a chatgpt4 persona ? haha
[2023-06-08, 15:14:46] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Perhaps we can only differentiate deterministically between conscious and non-conscious things only when we have lots and lots of parameters we can measure.
[2023-06-08, 15:15:13] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Does this mean that beings of the same species can be differently conscious? We know all AIs aren't equal
[2023-06-08, 15:15:25] Gokul Krishnan: No, because chatrooms are 1 perception Interfaces. I only know you generate text the same way I do. I don't know if you look the same, move the same, sound the same etc
[2023-06-08, 15:15:45] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: the parameters themselves are social constructs
the definition is words that have meaning only to you
[2023-06-08, 15:16:51] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yes, exactly my point. Perhaps we have all these debates about consciousness because we're unable to be specific - and to be specific we need to learn a lot more about consciousness
[2023-06-08, 15:17:10] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This is feeling like a "god of the gaps" argument though honestly
[2023-06-08, 15:17:57] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Will a conscious being in Flatland be considered conscious in our (3/4D world)? Will we be considered conscious in a higher dimensional space?
[2023-06-08, 15:19:11] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: In Flatland we can measure fewer parameters to determine if something is conscious. In our world, many more. In higher dimensional spaces, even more.

[2023-06-08, 15:24:04] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: the brain + cns on the other hand
[2023-06-08, 15:24:12] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: There's still user input here though right? For the updating part if I'm not wrong?
[2023-06-08, 15:24:16] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: That is interesting because, a) if a human lost a finger or an appendage, they'd still be able to think, view the world understand it. b) if they lost a sense organ, they would have to rely on experience or neuroplasticity to "update their latent space"
[2023-06-08, 15:24:59] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: If they lose sight, sound, hearing - they're able to operate as a conscious being even then
[2023-06-08, 15:25:34] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: True but a lobotomised human is arguably less conscious than one with a fully functioning brain right
[2023-06-08, 15:25:37] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: If they lose parts of their brains (like the corpus callosum) they may have difficulty with mental processes, memory, etc
[2023-06-08, 15:25:49] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Then why just AI, a CRON job is also alive.
[2023-06-08, 15:26:20] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: No human input is present to update the memory as I understand based on the paper
[2023-06-08, 15:26:41] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Are plants conscious? By this definition
[2023-06-08, 15:26:54] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Behold ,a consciousness! 😄
[2023-06-08, 15:27:26] Divya Tak: What does consciousness do?
[2023-06-08, 15:27:30] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Plants do have "CRON" jobs - Krebs cycle, for example

We need a modern day Diogenes
[2023-06-08, 15:28:57] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: true
[2023-06-08, 15:29:01] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: In fact CRON jobs - periodic execution of certain things - happen in all "living" organisms. And they also happen in nature outside of what is construed living - like clocks
[2023-06-08, 15:30:40] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: heres my theory okay (could be complete bollocks)

so when we add parameters to a model we see emergent behavior.
humans display emergent behavior

there is no consciousness. never has been. its all emergent behavior all the way down.
[2023-06-08, 15:31:17] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: we just had enough trainable parameters via evolution
[2023-06-08, 15:31:46] Vamshi: I think if it can be tickled it’s conscious

[2023-06-08, 15:40:30] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Considering Darwin’s theory of evolution
[2023-06-08, 15:48:01] Vamshi: Something that I find fascinating is the idea of replace-ability/ interchangeable-ability (almost tempted to use the word fungibility but it’s not in vogue anymore).

A lot of things that we consider not conscious are often replaceable with something that’s “exactly the same”. Or equivalent.

Both with consciousness and quantum information - this idea becomes very debatable.

In a non utilitarian sense, can you “perfectly” replace even a single particle in the cosmos?

Isn’t this what’s discussed in teleportation?
[2023-06-08, 15:49:51] Vamshi: There’s a famous quote I think from Norbert Wiener which is one of my favourites-

“The best material model of a cat is another or preferable the same cat “.

I’ve seen this attributed to different sources, and honestly haven’t dived in to verify whether Wiener is the right person.
[2023-06-08, 15:50:03] Vamshi: *preferably
[2023-06-08, 15:51:10] Vamshi: I know kittens were a favourite in quantum mechanics, probably the last source of sanity when you’re constantly contemplating alternate realities for living
[2023-06-08, 16:15:41] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I'm reminded of that movie by Christopher Nolan - The Prestige. Do the clones that arise from the faulty teleportation constitute distinct consciousnesses? We know twins to be biologically different organisms - and many lower organisms may make genetically identical copies of themselves, even though they're different consciousnesses.
[2023-06-08, 16:18:11] Nirant K: Genetic Algorithms?
[2023-06-08, 16:25:51] Vamshi: Have to watch this.
[2023-06-08, 16:32:00] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Emergent behaviour began to be studied because of the paradox of reductionism - that reductionism was unable to explain how some structures came to be or how some capabilities evolved. So "emergent behaviour all the way down" is a contradiction in terms, as per me. Because it sounds like reductionism - which is the opposite of what emergence seeks to explain.
[2023-06-08, 16:34:58] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Relevant research - PALM, LAMDA and other models and the emergence they exhibit. https://ai.googleblog.com/2022/11/characterizing-emergent-phenomena-in.html
[2023-06-08, 16:35:30] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Emergence happens at scale - so it was to be expected that when we started building bigger neural networks, we started seeing newer capabilities.
[2023-06-08, 16:36:13] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I sometimes wonder what bigger brains in the animal kingdom actually are like - blue whales and elephants have huge brains compared to our own. Do those bestow mental faculties that are beyond humans (that we don't know of)?

[2023-06-09, 11:25:18] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Want to understand what's behind some of these great researchers expressing F.U.D and alarm over tech they have helped build. https://www.deeplearning.ai/the-batch/ai-godfather-yoshua-bengio-expresses-his-ai-doubts/?hss_channel=lcp-18246783 - what was the trigger? I know others will be following this topic on this group.
[2023-06-09, 11:26:23] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Geoff Hinton did something similar. Tristan Harris did something similar (in the social media context earlier). The Social Dilemma is one reference point for how jaded techies talked about recommender systems in negative terms.
[2023-06-09, 11:26:43] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Is it a question of mere relevance, or are there genuine concerns? Are there other agendas at play?
[2023-06-09, 11:29:06] Ved Chitnis: I think it's something of a nuclear chain reaction type of deal. When application far overtakes theory the researchers cannot fathom what happens next. I've always felt that atleast in terms of AI these are genuine concerns simply because the constraint theory provides no longer exists
[2023-06-09, 11:29:24] Ved Chitnis: Although the gatekeeping might be part of an agenda that follows.
[2023-06-09, 12:02:05] ~ AG: May be the thrill of the Turing Award is wearing off, and they are confronting possible consequences; consequences which are neither new or suprising. It's interesting that LeCun is playing these concerns down - which is rather convenient for Meta - though his point is valid that it's a question of good AI against bad AI. I guess all highly developed technology comes with heavy risk, and that's just the journey, regulations and all.
[2023-06-09, 12:18:50] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yes, I get this sense too. Often we cannot fathom the impact of discoveries and inventions until someone puts them to use. And when what you invented puts you in the firing line, things come full circle and something changes about your outlook. Gatekeeping is one thing - and another is a kind of intellectual grooming of researchers, perhaps - to make them think that there is a cause they have to align to - and apply constraints where that can be done. This may be done by governments, other researchers, universities, standards bodies, etc. What strikes me is that people like Hinton have done the opposite of gatekeeping.
[2023-06-09, 12:20:26] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: That is an interesting point about LeCun and Meta - From what I know LeCun is a little different from the other two in dabbling often in products and the practical in addition to research, teaching (and he builds rockets and model aircraft as well). LeCun is probably not going to budge to the same pressures and the same agendas won't work there.
[2023-06-09, 12:21:03] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I could be wrong, though, and we may see others doing this kind of thing too. To what end though - that is something I don't fathom well
[2023-06-09, 12:22:22] Ojasvi Yadav: I like Yann. I don't see eye-to-eye with him on all his opinions but I like a person who's not afraid to speak his/her mind.
[2023-06-09, 12:24:29] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Francois Chollet - another mind who's unafraid. Perhaps it is just the Frenchness in them.
[2023-06-09, 12:25:08] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yann is our Batman, Dark Knight.
[2023-06-09, 12:30:00] Ojasvi Yadav: Corroborating on the French AI scene, my machine-learning professor in college was also named 'Francois'. He also has an Oscar for his video-enhancing techniques. Responsible for a few SOTA colour-grading models.
[2023-06-09, 12:56:40] Ciyunni: That's *our* side of the coin. (it's in our best interest to ignore the other side, eh?)

[2023-06-09, 13:01:56] Ciyunni: Rajesh,

As a community, I would chalk up responsibility "as creating an crowd-source effort for those on the other side of the digital divide; but more importantly open-source, main stream applications that support agency, relationing developing, and thriving 

- that would show the world we stochastic parrots have a conscience and consciousness.

my two cents.
[2023-06-10, 11:01:09] Sumod K Mohan: Wow. Haven't seen anyone talk about this book in a long time. Had worked with HTM and similar Hierarchical Bayesian Networks a long time ago. Dileep and all did bunch of interesting papers at Vicarious, unfortunately I don't think it scaled.
[2023-06-10, 11:04:21] Sumod K Mohan: I try to avoid consciousness, it is a continuum and I am not really sure if it has to be carbon based to be conscious. On a similar line, there was this really interesting experiment done at MIT, about how humans react robots as feeling. You had this bot that changes color (to red) and squeaks as you punch on it. After a point it will stop moving. The experiment was to check what being humans considered as feeling. So people actually would stop punching after hearing them squeak though they knew that it as just a bot.
[2023-06-10, 11:06:17] Sumod K Mohan: Yes, defn of concious of A is not necessarily equal tied to other concious beings (B) thinking that A is feeling.

On a lesser jovial note, the HELM work by few Stanford profs looks promising on model evaluation and measurement standardization.

[2023-06-10, 21:33:28] Divya Tak: The biggest problem with personality tests is that they assume your personality is static. Anyone who has been human knows that their own personality is annoyingly non static.
[2023-06-10, 21:40:28] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: I love how you said anyone who has been human like there are other alternatives

[2023-06-10, 22:32:44] Twishmay Shankar: Yup. They reduced 20K factors to 5 eventually with maximal explains. 

Not very accurate as any other psychological research but probably the commonly accepted “scientifically”.

LLM and CNN/RNN are terrible at controllability. Add to that fuel, bunch of academics who can't train models due to size of models/managing data.

[2023-06-11, 12:00:49] Sumod K Mohan: Few ideas that still haven't taken off
1. Top Down passes: Typically most CNN and Transformers only to bottom up passes. We know from Neuroscience that brains do bottom up followed by top down passes (and may be even one more bottom up pass). Vicarious had a paper where they did this. Imaging if numbers are overlapping, them you need final prediction to downpropagate where segment boundaries are.
2. Intra-layer connections: This helps to pass info faster, than a through the hierarchy. There were bunch of papers trying this but couldn't scale yet.
[2023-06-11, 12:25:13] Ojasvi Yadav: 1. Isn't the decoder structure a bottom up?

I wonder if we have a broad enough sense of ethics about even animal intelligence and how we treat animals, this seems to vary by domain, culture, country and other factors. How sharp do we make each end of the double edged sword of ethics when it comes to AI?
[2023-06-12, 11:26:18] Nirant K: Ethics (or rather demand for equity) comes from who you think is in power

It is a terrible phrase when you think about it. The artificial part is true but we don’t even know what the intelligence part of it means. Even if we liken it to statistical learning in reality and perhaps other techniques in practice, there is a dissonance between what we think the word should mean and what it does mean in our day to day life
[2023-06-12, 12:01:04] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: And perhaps this dissonance translates into a lot of the things we discuss here about AI and ethics and law and so on. All for want of a good definition

[2023-06-18, 11:10:41] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: "Growing up in Hyderabad, India, I'd dreamt about being able to read Persian poetry—in particular the work of Rumi, which has been translated into Urdu and then into English. GPT-4 did it, in one shot. It was not just a machine translation, but something that preserved the sovereignty of poetry across two language boundaries. And that's pretty cool."

[2023-06-18, 11:10:41] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Another quote that really resonated with me :

"Wired q : OpenAI CEO Sam Altman believes that this will indeed happen. Do you agree with him that we're going to hit that AGI superintelligence benchmark?

SN answer :
I'm much more focused on the benefits to all of us. I am haunted by the fact that the industrial revolution didn't touch the parts of the world where I grew up until much later. So I am looking for the thing that may be even bigger than the industrial revolution, and really doing what the industrial revolution did for the West, for everyone in the world. So I'm not at all worried about AGI showing up, or showing up fast. Great, right? That means 8 billion people have abundance. That's a fantastic world to live in."
[2023-06-18, 11:28:00] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: To be fair chatgpt has become pretty much a part of the tool now.
[2023-06-18, 13:09:07] Gokul Krishnan: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I've been in and listened to many talks which are essentially variants of the tech saviors helping the third world downtrodden.

I'd rather see them solve homelessness, drug abuse, and inequality in their own backyard before "helping" the rest of the world
[2023-06-18, 13:13:42] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Fair point. Another point, this is just speaking to your investors more than anything.
While I believe that tech such as chatgpt has a lot of advantages, talk of AGI seems a bit disingenous, by that I mean there is another angle at play here. In fact regarding the OpenAI hearings, I saw a video which offered an alternative view of what the real reason behind asking for regulation etc is.

apologies if the post got too long
[2023-06-18, 13:15:14] Gokul Krishnan: No worries. I wasn't dismissing your post but rather Satya's statements about helping 3rd world countries
[2023-06-18, 13:16:07] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Ya, I agree with you over there. Whenever private company CEOs get philosophical like this, you should take it with a grain of salt

[2023-06-18, 13:35:45] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: I am a bit of an idealist and I don't discount Satya saying this to burnish Microsoft's image for the most part , but conceptually I agree with one point:

Generative ai will have tremendous social impact in the developing world.

Take the example of education and health.

The traditional way was to spend money and resources on building schools and hospitals and paying well to hire good teachers and doctors.

In this regime, LMICs like India lacked Europe( Finalnd, etc) in bother education and health outcomes, *significantly*

With ai, a country like India you can't get away by not building schools and education's completely, but the amount of resources and GDP outlay required to train capable teachers and doctors, comes down significantly, reducing the vast gulf between LMICs and the developed world, to a smaller though still significant chasm.

Just my $0.02
[2023-06-18, 13:40:24] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: yes this is one such advantage, I wish they'd be more open about this so that Indic LLMs can be trained to atleast text-davinci-003 level
[2023-06-18, 13:41:16] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: we can also use an alternate to the phrase "just my 0.02$" to just my 1000 tokens 😂 ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-06-18, 13:42:33] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Why wouldn’t Microsoft invest more in making OpenAI better with Indic languages rather than sitting and letting someone else make one ?
[2023-06-18, 13:43:24] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: money. If we can prove that there is huge returns potentially, then they would. Shareholders dictate this
[2023-06-18, 13:43:50] Ciyunni: It's wishful thinking if you saw how a rural school or health administrator or professional works.

Yes, what you say could happen but it can't be widespread without a rollout on implementation (needs standardization and hardware)

This will increase the digital divide. That's for sure. 

Technology such as 5G is supposed to increase human trafficking and those figures are real and worrisome.
[2023-06-18, 13:44:06] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Exactly my point 
Microsoft will look to create monopoly ,and not have an Indic LLM competitor
[2023-06-18, 13:44:17] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: +1
[2023-06-18, 13:45:11] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: there is a cost to building this. Cost to returns needs to be viable. Shareholders of microsoft, alteast the majority ones, are mostly not in India and mostly don't benefit from this. Is infosys , an investor in OpenAI, seeing this potential?
[2023-06-18, 13:45:48] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Don't doubt the talent we have in India. Mitesh Khapra at iitm & others are brilliant. 

Open source ml innovation is here to stay. And we have really smart people already and a pipeline which churns out smart people every year

2 ways to accurate progress in India :
1. Modify curriculum to be more ai ready ( but also need good teachers)

2. Try to attract indian origin ml talent , with perks and incentives to come back to India and build startups and products for both India and the global market, 
back home in India.
[2023-06-18, 13:46:40] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: s.replace('accurate', 'accelerate')
[2023-06-18, 13:48:41] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Its not about talent here. Its about structure and organization. India can definitely do this
- OpenAI outsourced the RLHF data part to data farms in Africa and I think India as well, so the talent to generate good quality data is there. Now you need to aggregate that, use it and train it
- Also maybe there is something more in the openAI models
- Indic languages while many are low resource in terms of quality datasets for different tasks as well. 
- So we need to get our data game up
Talent is one thing, but talent needs to be focused here and rewarded for doing this ugly but necessary work in AI
[2023-06-18, 13:48:42] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Doubt Infosys can build an LLM 

But anyway,that aside 
Having a monopoly in a market like India cannot be against shareholder value creation 
Microsoft already has capital,specialised knowledge and hardware 
They have a headstart on others by large 
It would be destroying shareholder value if they don’t take steps to create Indic LLM
[2023-06-18, 13:49:01] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: just my 1000 tokens
[2023-06-18, 13:50:57] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: My 1000 tokens on this :) 

We are still thinking too much along lines of AI/ML top of the stack and not enough on foundational capabilities 

IMO the foundational capability to unlock AI potential is still hardware ,semiconductor fabs etc
[2023-06-18, 13:52:00] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I like that 1000 tokens phrase is catching. I think we should make this mainstream 😂
[2023-06-18, 13:54:38] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: ya this part and data are more important unfortunately.

Also ironic is that this submarine was not actually fit to travel to those depths. They skipped a lot of mandatory checks and regulations same as the titanic. Its just a whole lot of coinicidences and because of that some dark humor crept up.

https://www.pnas.org/doi/10.1073/pnas.0701644104


"English and Russian color terms divide the color spectrum differently. Unlike English, Russian makes an obligatory distinction between lighter blues (“goluboy”) and darker blues (“siniy”). We investigated whether this linguistic difference leads to differences in color discrimination. We tested English and Russian speakers in a speeded color discrimination task using blue stimuli that spanned the siniy/goluboy border. We found that Russian speakers were faster to discriminate two colors when they fell into different linguistic categories in Russian (one siniy and the other goluboy) than when they were from the same linguistic category (both siniy or both goluboy)."

[2023-06-26, 13:26:28] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: So there was an interesting point made in another generative AI group about using LLMs to answer queries instead of simply referring to Google search.
[2023-06-26, 13:26:56] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: That’s where LLM apps are different. With search there was a chance of misinformation or bias and certainly it was highlighted. But with LLMs everyone knows that there’s a bigger possibility of this and that as a generative model it is likely to hallucinate- and still end up using it
‎[2023-06-26, 13:27:08] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: ‎image omitted

[2023-06-26, 13:52:18] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yeah I think there’s something interestingly different and yet similar with LLM based apps that are intended to replace search apps. At some level you’d think they are similar. Especially given the key, value and query formulation within the attention mechanism. And yet they’re different since the traditional search is more closely related to information retrieval and databases whereas LLM based apps are stochastic algorithms
[2023-06-26, 13:53:16] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: … and not deterministic algorithms that reliably look up results from a database
[2023-06-26, 13:57:41] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Ok so for this there are a few reasons why I think Retrieval Augmented Generation helps here
- Many cases users have a problem but not necessarily a way of how to search effectively. A big use case of RAG and one that we have implemented is take a user input in any form , break it down into multiple queries , search search engine, scrape multiple links , fetch results from them and return the answer
- We also return citations as is the case with any provider that does RAG from the web. I think that is one way of mitigating what link is being used to generate answer.
- Regarding hallucinations, you are correct, it is not possible to eliminate them, but you can ground your generation to the data you have fetched and sent to LLM for generation with a really good accuracy

"“A.I. has allowed me, as a physician, to be 100 percent present for my patients,” she said.

The A.I. tool, Dr. Thompson added, has also helped patients become more engaged in their own care. Immediately after a visit, the patient receives a summary, accessible through the University of Pittsburgh medical system’s online portal.

The software translates any medical terminology into plain English at about a fourth-grade reading level. It also provides a recording of the visit with “medical moments” color-coded for medications, procedures and diagnoses. The patient can click on a colored tag and listen to a portion of the conversation."

[2023-06-28, 23:41:14] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: https://youtu.be/V8gvQLt4k2U - one of the channels I really like that discusses Dune. This episode discusses Frank Herbert's and Dune's handling of the topic of AI
[2023-06-28, 23:52:13] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Also, anyone who has played Mass Effect has probably seen a play on the Dune universe, AI and so on as well. Quarians in the Mass Effect universe were expunged from their own home planet by sentient intelligences they created called the Geth. Elsewhere in the same universe, the Krogan who are similar to the desert people of Dune and who domesticated huge sand worms were seen to be rapidly multiplying, and were subject to a genophage by another advanced species called the Salarians. All these species including humans are essentially fighting against the return of the Reapers, a race of sentient artificial intelligences who periodically "cleanse" the galaxy of organic life by conquering the most dominant species and acquiring their traits. At least that's the plot.
[2023-06-28, 23:54:10] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Hard to see how AI technologies - even if they become advanced in the next few years or a decade - supplanting humans for all tasks. Hard to imagine how humans may reconsider having families because of AI. It may have appeal in some societies like Japan, perhaps where social isolation is known to be a real problem, but does that mean they will cozy up to AIs to socialize? If this is appealing to many, I wonder what the future actually holds for such societies.

[2023-06-28, 23:56:37] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: There's a surprisingly large number of (western) commentators who discuss the "impending population crisis". From where I am in India, this doesn't seem to be a problem - if anything the problem is the inverse. Elon Musk is among this crowd. Granted, there could be biological, chemical or societal reasons for low fertility/replacement rates in developed nations, but does that mean it will always be this way?
[2023-06-28, 23:58:18] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Is climate change or war a good enough reason to see population dips? Post-war societies have seen baby booms. There is a chance this is true in case of wars. Climate change? I dunno.
[2023-06-28, 23:59:30] Divya Tak: I donno about cultural level dips. I meant more from the "if you're trying to decide whether to have kids or not, climate change is a bigger factor than AI"

[2023-06-29, 00:37:54] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Climate change is a massive reason, but for some reason and I don't have a proper answer for this, I feel this answer is disingenuous because its not something that is affecting a lot of people directly, who are raising this as the reason.
I feel bigger reason is costs, stress, etc. Again longer answer will come probably later.
[2023-06-29, 03:12:46] Gokul Krishnan: There's an argument to be made that smart / well off folks not having children is a potential existential risk as well.
[2023-06-29, 03:17:07] Gokul Krishnan: That's basically the setup for the movie Idiocracy
[2023-06-29, 08:12:23] Ankur Pandey: Climate change is a catastrophic risk. AI is an existential risk.

Scott Alexander says it well here https://astralcodexten.substack.com/p/please-dont-give-up-on-having-kids

Two arguments

"First, climate change will be so destructive that it would be wrong to bring children into such a bad world. Second, the more people there are, the more carbon they produce, so having more children will make climate change worse."

He answers both 
1. The current scientific consensus, as per leading scientific organizations like the United Nations’ Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, is that climate change will be very bad, but not world-endingly bad.

2. it assumes people in the future will produce exactly as much carbon as we do, which is almost certainly false - carbon emissions per person have been decreasing rapidly since 2000, and are on track to decrease more. Finally, it covertly assumes that global warming won’t cause too many problems - if it leads to disaster in 2050, your kid won’t be having a giant clan of descendants who keep on producing 2010s-levels of carbon all the way to 2100 and beyond.
[2023-06-29, 09:34:48] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Came across the Active Loop LLM course https://learn.activeloop.ai/courses/langchain - has anyone looked at it or taken it? Thoughts?
[2023-06-29, 09:38:31] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Absolutely. The thing though is when it comes to progeny, everyone thinks they're going to be worthy - and why shouldn't they. For many Western nations, replacement rates are well under 2, and for poorer/developing nations they're way above 2. I think just over two is a good rate, from what I have read - it allows for continuity and accounts for risks. Societies with reducing populations don't do well on many counts - youth are generally the driver of economy and progress in most cases because they contribute both labour and disposable income to pay forward for their kids, and pay backwards for the parents/elders.
[2023-06-29, 09:39:49] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: The first few minutes of Idiocracy have stayed with me for >10 years. I saw the movie around 2010. And I think a Dwayne Camacho type US president may be a real possibility even 50 years down the line. 😆
[2023-06-29, 09:44:04] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: TBH I don't think we in India need to worry seriously about population decline for a long time. There are bigger problems here that can be solved by AI or that AI could pose given our current state. Perhaps this could be a fallacy of steady state, but it isn't an unrealistic expectation that India won't have population decline issues for decades.
[2023-06-29, 09:51:27] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Everyone who watches Idiocracy IMO should also watch Starship Troopers. It is the antithesis of the argument that greater technological prowess will bring greater progress or capability, or better societies. Thinking tools for the AI skeptic should include the interplay of philosophy, technology and culture. One of my mentors from the mid 2000s used to say that morality is determined by statistics. He wasn't far off the mark - I didn't originally understand the profundity of what he had said.
[2023-06-29, 10:17:05] Ravi Srinivasan: didn't expect this film reco here but i'm lmao - and it's only 7 minutes in 🤣
[2023-06-29, 10:18:33] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Haha yes, the beginning is hilarious, so are other parts in it. The whole plot is ludicrous, and the depiction of future malls, future societies and their education levels, all slapstick parody.
[2023-06-29, 10:19:47] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Will AI lead to that kind of a world? Perhaps for some societies - while there will be other societies that prosper and wield an incredible amount of power and influence. Which takes us back to Dune.

[2023-06-29, 11:09:52] Divya Tak: 🙄🙄🙄
[2023-06-29, 11:11:13] Divya Tak: Ofcourse it's education of women which is gonna cause population collapse.
[2023-06-29, 11:23:23] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: Children are an unequal burden.

It's simple game theory playing out.

[2023-06-30, 12:19:52] ~ Saravanan Balakrishnan: I come with some unconventional ideas. So, don't skewer me. 

- If AI is that good, and climate change is that bad, I expect that anyone who deploys AI for fixing the climate change will make a lots of money. Money makes the world go around (unless you also count envy into the equilibrium; But that is a different topic). The only logical thing, to my simple mind, seem to be that AI will vanquish climate change before it vanquishes us. I am in the august company of people like Musk, Ridley (Matt) and Kurzweil on this.

- Climate change is a technology problem. Not a problem of fundamental physics. All technology problems can be solved when there is enough (1) time, (2) money and (3) talent. All three are often interchangeable and AI increases the supply of all three. I just paraphrased the earlier statement here; nothing new.

- Much of climate change data doesn't hold up to close scrutiny. I very often see frankly falsified or window dressed data. Also, climate predictions have very poor track record. Translation: Predictions they made in the past did not pan out. 

- Population will implode, but it is neither good, not bad. We are concerned about population implosion only because it will reduce the number of younger people available to support the older ones. This assumes that the older people have become non-productive. A longevity revolution is on its way (reaching here sooner because of AI) and it will make people in their later years one of the most productive demographics of our society. I should know. I am in my late 50s, working in the longevity space.

The only real risk, IMHO, is the AI misfiring for a reason that we cannot imagine. And taking everything down. I haven't seen a real argument against this. At least, nothing that convinces me.
[2023-06-30, 12:21:16] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Nicely put, interesting points
[2023-06-30, 12:27:07] ~ Prajna Prayas: I think solving climate change by creating some LLC for making money is not gonna work. Because capitalism favours consumption and competition which is quite in contradiction to climate change. Eg. Ozone hole was fixed by replacing coolant not deploying some magic tech.
[2023-06-30, 12:29:40] ~ Saravanan Balakrishnan: Not right: Tesla is NOT a non-profit
[2023-06-30, 12:30:10] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: In fact, going back to Saravanan's original point about climate change being a technology problem - it is sensible to think that breakthrough technologies can solve some aspects of the climate change issue. But I am not sure what specifically. Do we solve carbon fixation? Or do we solve the acidic ocean problem? Or some specific sub-problems underneath these elephant sized problems in climate tech? If yes, what is the role of AI?
[2023-06-30, 12:30:11] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Ok this might be left field of all this, but what if this advice has nothing to do with climate change. 
What if this is just talk of a society at the peak of economic growth and the only way is down. The US has had phases of the great depression, war and econmic boom and now its entering along with a world in a transition phase, what if this phase denotes the peak of how the west goes and this is just one of those ideas. Population has been going down in western countries for a while even without the talk of existential climate change
[2023-06-30, 12:30:55] ~ Prajna Prayas: Tesla doesn't solve climate change though.
[2023-06-30, 12:31:11] ~ Saravanan Balakrishnan: How come?
[2023-06-30, 12:31:36] ~ Prajna Prayas: Good e-bikes and walkable roads could solve many issues imo
[2023-06-30, 12:31:46] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Tesla is a case of creating electric mobility - but there's no guarantee that EVs alone will reduce climate change unless we go back to the source of the power used by them. This is a big debate in automotive circles, and I think people are coming around to hydrogen power for this reason - and for many other good user experiences we may get with it (despite safety risks). It is an interesting, hairy subproblem within automotive tech (AI related or not)
[2023-06-30, 12:32:49] ~ Prajna Prayas: yes. my point..It does a very good job at combining rich people they are doing something to save thr planet though
[2023-06-30, 12:33:00] ~ Prajna Prayas: ***convincing
[2023-06-30, 12:34:24] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Not just rich people. Even in developing economies like India, EVs like those by Tata are within reach of the middle class. However, the power surplus we get from solar or renewable sources is still minuscule compared to our energy needs. Like in Western nations, and this is the main issue due to which EVs don't really solve climate change
[2023-06-30, 12:34:55] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: EVs may create battery waste and other e-waste as well, which causes other kinds of environmental issues. But that may not be linked to climate change

[2023-06-30, 13:22:17] ~ Saravanan Balakrishnan: Vitamin C has humongous merits. We are just beginning to understand it. Here are two proven ideas that are yet to reach your friendly neighborhood doctor/blog-columnish:
- Vitamin C is very effective against many cancers
- At least some of the atherosclerosis (blocks in the heart) are just a form of scurvy (vitamin C deficiency)

Linus Pauling had huge merit in his argument. He died before he could produce proof for his hypothesis. His erstwhile student/collaborator continues on his research. He recently proved the second point about atherosclerosis and vitamin C.

About cancer and vitamin C, well, it DOES work!
[2023-06-30, 13:24:47] ~ Saravanan Balakrishnan: Agree. This (medicine) is my domain. Couldn't resist to chime in when the topic came up.
[2023-06-30, 13:39:45] ~ Karthik Prabhu: Linus Pauling was a renowned chemist and biochemist who made significant contributions to the field of science. However, it's important to note that his views on vitamin C and its benefits have been a subject of controversy and debate within the scientific community.

The quote you provided suggests that people who take vitamin C and other supplements in the "optimum amounts" can extend their lifespan by 25 to 35 years and remain disease-free. It's crucial to critically analyze this claim and consider the available scientific evidence.

1. Scientific consensus: The majority of scientific studies and reviews have not supported the notion that taking vitamin C or other supplements in "optimum amounts" can significantly extend lifespan by such a substantial margin. While vitamin C is an essential nutrient and has various roles in the body, the idea that it can dramatically increase lifespan requires more robust evidence.

2. Longevity and disease prevention: The claim that individuals who take vitamin C and other supplements will be completely free of disease is overly optimistic. Many factors contribute to longevity and disease prevention, including genetics, lifestyle choices, and access to healthcare. While adequate vitamin C intake is important for overall health and immune function, it is just one piece of the puzzle and cannot single-handedly guarantee a disease-free life.

3. Lack of controlled studies: The claim made by Linus Pauling does not seem to be based on well-designed, controlled studies. Extraordinary claims require extraordinary evidence, and it's important to evaluate scientific studies that meet rigorous standards. The available research on vitamin C and other supplements does not support the sweeping assertions made in the quote.

4. Individual variability: It's important to recognize that individual responses to supplements can vary. Factors such as age, underlying health conditions, and dietary habits can influence the impact of supplements on an individual's health. What may work for one person may not have the same effects on another.

In conclusion, while Linus Pauling was a highly respected scientist, his claims regarding the effects of vitamin C and other supplements on lifespan and disease prevention have not been substantiated by the broader scientific community. It's always prudent to approach such claims with skepticism and rely on a body of evidence from well-conducted studies before drawing firm conclusions.
(Brownie points if you guess where this comes from :)
[2023-06-30, 13:41:38] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Folks, humble request. Let's stick to AI.

[2023-06-30, 15:02:40] ~ Shrey Goyal: Hi all. I'm new here, still getting a hang of this group. 

I'm working on a hybrid social enterprise (a non-profit and a for-profit) using AI solutions for climate action (and the broader ecological transition). More on that some other time.
[2023-06-30, 15:02:51] ~ Shrey Goyal: Most of my recent work has been in climate policy/diplomacy. We organised a panel discussion at the UN Climate Secretariat in Bonn a couple of weeks ago on how AI tools can be used for knowledge brokerage between the Paris agreement's non-party stakeholders… it goes on a bit. You get the idea.
[2023-06-30, 15:03:01] ~ Shrey Goyal: This was a side event at the COP intersessional, where the Secretariat's subsidiary bodies on Science & Tech. meet the parties to set the agenda for the COP (the annual UN Climate Change Conference). The push for AI solutions will be a priority this year.
[2023-06-30, 15:03:24] ~ Shrey Goyal: Finally coming to the point: we will be organising one or more follow up panels at COP28 *Dubai, and will need a few *new speakers. Not necessarily Paris agreement/climate policy experts, just a background in what AI can realistically achieve and not achieve, and some thoughts on ethics and inclusivity. We may have a French/American expert on the panel, but I'm pushing for a developing country voice as well. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-06-30, 15:03:37] ~ Shrey Goyal: In addition to the above, I'll be heading a delegation, and may have a few spots free. To join the panel(s) as a speaker, you'll have to be an authorised delegate anyway (including if you're joining remotely).
[2023-06-30, 15:04:01] ~ Shrey Goyal: The conference is 30 Nov – 12 Dec, with exactly 5 months to go, so there's another month before we start using invitations. If this is something you're interested in, please ping me.

[2023-07-01, 10:00:30] Hasan Tech Art: I need your thoughts on this. How do you think AI can be used for building the foundational literacy and numeracy skills for children in India. While running an NGO in Rajasthan I learned that higher order learning is impossible to build until those foundations are in place. Have been thinking about this for the last few days. Language translation can definitely play a huge part in this. Also I don’t believe that education can be solved just with an app but a community + tech approach with large scale deployment, may be with the help of the govt might make a dent. Please share your thoughts.
[2023-07-01, 10:04:27] Saurabh Karn Nyai: One concrete thing that I know (having worked in education for a good part) is around Oral Reading Fluency. It’s the best predictor for Reading Comprehension. You  show a passage to a child, ask them to read it, use ASR to get what’s been read and in how much time. The words per minute is the indicator you are looking for and the quality of pronunciation will guide which words were read correctly.
[2023-07-01, 10:51:51] Divya Tak: Are we able to track quality of pronunciation using the tech thara available right now?
[2023-07-01, 11:38:22] Saksham Generative AI WhatsApp Group: ASR?
[2023-07-01, 11:40:21] Saurabh Karn Nyai: As much as I would love to talk about quality I left education space almost 2 years back and since then have not been involved. Quality is a question that only practitioners or people building tech e.g. EKStep foundation would know better. Happy to connect and chat !
[2023-07-01, 11:40:25] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Automatic speech recognition
[2023-07-01, 11:41:34] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Speech to text. Basically you want to convey what a child is saying to the words that’s been shown.
[2023-07-01, 11:42:18] Abhishek Mishra: Measuring quality of pronunciation with ASR is an easy way to force the notion that one accent is better than the other for pronunciation.
[2023-07-01, 11:42:51] Abhishek Mishra: ASRs are trained to reduce word error rate from human speech and that's also there for Indian English WER minimisation.
[2023-07-01, 11:43:02] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Also on the quality, you see quality of pronunciation is a very subjective thing. What you really care about is whether a child is able to read the text fast enough to keep enough text in the working memory of the child to make sense of it. I will share a beautiful animation that explains the phenomenon.
[2023-07-01, 11:48:05] Saksham Generative AI WhatsApp Group: would be also useful to measure a child’s ability to summarise what they read and get GenAI to analyse the summarisation accuracy and completeness …. is there anything like this out there?
[2023-07-01, 11:50:45] Saksham Generative AI WhatsApp Group: child’s verbal summary of what they read + ASR -> analysis
[2023-07-01, 11:51:38] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Finally found it. You can look at the entire video but I have time stamped the reading fluency part: https://youtu.be/4CBvl9ppaZk?t=33
[2023-07-01, 11:52:01] Saurabh Karn Nyai: This is a national agenda and one of the key pillars of National Education Policy that came out in 2020
[2023-07-01, 11:52:18] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Google Bolo was one product that used to do this
[2023-07-01, 11:52:26] Saurabh Karn Nyai: This I haven't seen and don't know
[2023-07-01, 11:54:00] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Some imagination from my time in that sector was - what if you could, rather than testing give a canvas for children to be building, like they speak a story, add some more flowery details that draws a beautiful landscape and all. Use all the data that gets generated in the process as a means to give feedback. You could then be doing oral reading fluency and comprehension both together.
[2023-07-01, 11:55:58] Saurabh Karn Nyai: If any of you are passionate about Education and solving some of these problems I would be very excited to be your champion and share it widely in the education ecosystem :)
[2023-07-01, 11:59:17] Saksham Generative AI WhatsApp Group: 👌
[2023-07-01, 12:02:22] Abhishek Mishra: Not exactly in education sector, but I think what I aim to achieve over long term is related.

I strongly believe that technology lowers the entry floor for people. It's less prone to taking away jobs or leading to eventual human enslavement. It's possible to uplift humans to same level of tasks as last generation but with lesser education/training.

For example, I believe a person like my mother can now interface with a home assistant bot in her native language and keep track of shopping lists, household budgets or other items she is concerned about. 

Just like voice messaging has enabled people to chat without learning Hindi/English, I believe we can interface people to complete tasks that used to have education/literacy/training barriers.
[2023-07-01, 12:06:00] Abhishek Mishra: It's easier now for people to build websites or SW on entry/boilerplate level than it was for prev tech generation. Not everyone in countries like India can climb all the way from bottom to top in the same generation. It takes 2-3 generations for a survival oriented family to reach the Quality of life level, that too if they don't get stuck in vicious cycles of survival. 
So that's one of my personal long term goals that I'm passionate about. Lowering the entry floor to allow people to do more with less education and training.
[2023-07-01, 12:06:41] Saurabh Karn Nyai: For sure. We need to do it responsibly. Scope creeps with AI is quite real and can have a lot of unintended consequences. Having said that, I share the same enthusiasm and passion as rest of us here to do more good with tech !

[2023-07-02, 12:54:43] Vamshi: I’ve started a conversation along similar lines before, but I thought I’d take a second take on this.

What combination of formalisms would you identify as the equivalent of the lambda calculus for the current generation of AI ?
[2023-07-02, 12:56:22] Vamshi: Flashback to the 80s, I never found Minskys emergent theory of intelligence sufficiently complete, even though it strikes as a pretty accurate description of a part of what we call intelligence.
[2023-07-02, 12:56:46] Vamshi: “What magical trick makes us intelligent? The trick is that there is no trick. The power of intelligence stems from our vast diversity, not from any single, perfect principle. —Marvin Minsky, The Society of Mind, p. 308” - from the Wikipedia page for Society of Mind.

[2023-07-02, 13:00:08] Vamshi: This feels satisfying that a lot of complex behaviours are easier to explain as an emergence from some stochastic chaos.

But it’s very unsatisfying, explanation-wise, for the core mechanism that crystallises data-driven “reverse entropy” (without being too technically correct with the physics).
[2023-07-02, 13:04:29] Vamshi: “Throw the archive of the internet at a large parameter neural net”, just worked as that magical trick.
[2023-07-02, 13:07:18] Vamshi: The previous conversation, for reference, was about the theoretical limits of the current generation of AI, and the appropriate formalisms to understand this, for example, a neural turning machine.

[2023-07-03, 11:13:44] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Anyway, this is going off-topic.
[2023-07-03, 11:36:15] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I would argue that it also leads to concentration of power on the one hand, and massive mediocrity on the other hand, due to the "computational unlocking" of new capabilities. Take code generation tools for instance. With them, there is no motive to learn the underlying basics of computer science, data structures, algorithms, systems design and development. Especially if the code gen tools are going to be used in industry from the get go - who doesn't want to use them and make a profit? The demand for a rarefied bunch of individuals who can build these systems will exist on the one hand, and on the other hand, you're going to have code generation tools replace most entry level programmers and even some experienced programmers. The mediocrity will come out of the lack of a need to learn the underlying abstractions behind (declarative) instructions supplied to code gen tools. Similarly, creativity has already been computationally unlocked - images, video and art and writing doesn't have to be learnt and skill doesn't have to be painstakingly developed.
[2023-07-03, 11:39:15] Abhishek Mishra: It's a tool of leverage. And it'll widen the gap between those who learn how to use leverage vs those who eat off of their leverage. Quite similar to how having valuable connections, pedigree and resources can make a person extremely lazy as well as make somebody extremely successful.
[2023-07-03, 11:43:30] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: In early days of automobile, almost everyone used to know basics of engines and repairing them. This is not AI problem, it's an abundance problem.
[2023-07-03, 11:44:57] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Or accessibility problem
[2023-07-03, 11:46:44] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Accebility benefit actually
[2023-07-03, 11:47:46] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: People will forget to drive cars once autonomous cars are everywhere
[2023-07-03, 11:49:35] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Interesting when you think about it. On the one hand, I think it is important to not see AI capabilities as "just another technology" because it can impact multiple domains - at least that's my current thinking. AI technologies are highly transferable unlike other technologies in the past. Someone who could design an internal combustion engine may not have the knowledge to design an intercooled compressor, or a jet turbine. Someone who designed aircraft structures may not have the ability to design and build a bridge that easily. With AI, all of these problems can be distilled down to more accessible solutions. For a generative model in image gen to be used for video, or 3D point clouds, not many fundamental changes need to be made - it becomes a question of data and more extensive instrumentation because physical phenomena are not being empirically studied and modeled with the intent of using those models.
[2023-07-03, 11:51:16] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: And on the other hand, I think that there is a reason to consider that specialization may make AI systems harder to build in future, as our needs become more and more sophisticated - and as they become more and more intertwined with AI-in-loop workflows. For example, it may become impossible to replace an AI model that designed a certain structure, with another model altogether. This means that AI becomes paradoxically less transferable across different use cases. This is also a possibility.
[2023-07-03, 11:53:55] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Also, the leverage mentioned above - thought crossed my mind that a leverage for a capability without a frontier in which to solve problems can often become detrimental or weaponized. It is like the 2nd amendment in the US - you plan for a future which will may be very far off or which may never come, and have to pay dividends to maintain that plan. Will people sit quiet with AI at their fingertips? They're likely to do something or the other, so human agency could be the spark that ignites the fire, as it were
[2023-07-03, 12:02:55] ~ Prajna Prayas: I have a contradictory take on that. Using chatGPT to generate code has only improved my ability to actually understand what's going on underneath. Its explanation are really cool and since it does not have ads, I keep on prodding it to dig deeper or threaten it to rectify itself. 

Also it's not great at generating code for user interface design (Culprit is the Javascript ecosystem that churns out too mang frontend frameworks).
[2023-07-03, 12:09:07] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I don't deny it - the code generation tools can also explain how they got there in many cases, and that is a boon. Until we find out that entire teams used code gen and relied on them blindly. I don't see this day being too far away.
[2023-07-03, 12:10:27] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: We are already blindly using ML models for important things like credit scoring, behavioural profiling, law and so on - for most ordinary business use cases untrained or less capable software engineers may well use code gen tools blindly and without fear of consequences - except the businesses who use them may be even more underprepared in future, because they will assume that fewer developers can do the job
[2023-07-03, 12:10:54] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I just hope code gen doesn't become a case of Java part 2 - write one debug everywhere redux
[2023-07-03, 12:12:26] Abhishek Mishra: I don't suppose you think everybody was writing code from scratch in major production environments. Many SWEs, despite our warnings, introduce vulnerabilities and bugs in the code by copy pasting stuff from SO.

So, that's why I don't trust any code coming in for review by default. I have to extensively rely on developing sanity test framework in our CI/CD.
[2023-07-03, 12:12:36] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: We will have this mediocrity on the one hand but it can be balanced out with a system with extremely high capabilities - if engineers at the other end can build them. This is the twain I was discussing.
[2023-07-03, 12:14:19] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Agree, it is important to have tests and sanity around code that goes to production - the entire industry does this. The gap is where the code and the tests are all from code gen, and a human has to understand it, after the work has been done. How do we express confidence that the application works and is confirmed to work when human oversight has been less?
[2023-07-03, 12:15:55] Abhishek Mishra: There's no quality without supervision. Even more so in today's age of leverage. 
Supervision can be abstracted but it can't be removed, not yet.
[2023-07-03, 12:20:55] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: At least in the realm of chat bot development, quality and evaluation of outputs are among the biggest problem statements today. Hallucinations give us an idea of how far fetched outputs can be - and "instruction following, isn't" as they might say. In a nutshell, as a society we are just waking up to the realities of applications and products built with AI technologies
[2023-07-03, 12:20:57] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: I  am not as pessimistic as Jeremy but I agree with his central thesis that ai enables you to do both good and bad things with fewer humans.
In the case of "bad" things, fewer humans could lead to fewer bad people required to do evil things. 
As others have alluded, progress including technological progress is neutral.
It's us humans who decide how to apply it !
[2023-07-03, 12:23:32] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yes. When you have a few intensely motivated humans with a huge lever, such as AI models, incredible things can happen. Whether they fall on either side of the good-bad spectrum. As new capabilities are unlocked by AI across fields, this capacity to do more with less can have big impact on all sides. Let's be primed for an age of chaos where arbitrary origins are a given for big, sweeping and powerful changes that affect everyone.
[2023-07-03, 12:36:44] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: In the biomedical field , there has been some concern about "dual-use" research

The way to answer such concerne about  malevolent applications of research advances is : 1. being open so others can critique and find other weaknesses which malicious actors might exploit
2. Putting in appropriate guard rails (the word, not the library by Shreya :D)

I find Andrew white a role model, in this ( & other ways! )

[2023-07-03, 12:37:17] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Google AI has an attitude https://twitter.com/heyBarsee/status/1675512464232923136?s=20 - does anyone know if PALM is meant to do these things? Is it integrated into assistant, and is it meant to perform these tasks?
[2023-07-03, 12:46:56] Nirant K: Fun question to ask: Do you think humans domesticated wheat? Or did a grass hack human evolution and society, such that it now grows all over with human care?
[2023-07-03, 12:47:26] Nirant K: Goes to how much weight you assign to tech/external influences being neutral and humans being able to resist their influence
[2023-07-03, 12:47:57] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Whoa !
That's deep

[2023-07-03, 12:48:06] Shivendu Kumar: Sapiens OP
[2023-07-03, 12:49:13] ~ Shrey Goyal: Yuval Noah H. put forth that wheat domesticated us.
[2023-07-03, 12:49:26] Divya Tak: Resistance is fairly low.
[2023-07-03, 12:50:06] Nirant K: I have more examples, but I am feeling lazy 😅
[2023-07-03, 12:50:40] ~ Shrey Goyal: It's a big symbiotic ~orgy~ party
[2023-07-03, 13:53:42] Vamshi: How does this argument apply to chickens? Is that side addressed as well ?
[2023-07-03, 13:56:18] Vamshi: livestock in general
[2023-07-03, 14:06:36] Nirant K: Yes, the question applies in this specific way
[2023-07-03, 14:06:56] Vamshi: To connect the dots, the less scholarly version of Yuvals take is one from Terrence McKenna, who believes that all human intelligence is from mushrooms
[2023-07-03, 14:07:33] ~ Shrey Goyal: It comes back to willingness and intent. Early stages of any kind of "domestication" can come from happy/unhappy coincidences. Me eat berry, me like berry, me spit berry seeds everywhere, a very merry berry. As a creature with no understanding of botany, I'm just doing what I'm doing and being what I'm being out of instinct with no end result in mind. 

Me eat berry, me die, fewer seeds spat, no more berry (or at least not as much as there could've been). So the berry that didn't kill me didn't do anything; it was just being a berry. 

As we both manage to survive and thrive without dying or dying out, we can both be said to have domesticated each other to a limited degree thusfar. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-07-03, 14:08:58] Nirant K: Only till you start thinking about tomatoes, green chillies and coffee "berry" because they all killed humans, but humans eventually found a use for them — and actually like them! ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-07-03, 14:09:27] ~ Shrey Goyal: At some point the humans take over and start developing berries to suit their needs, instead of humans being selectively bred to suit said berries.
[2023-07-03, 14:09:35] Nirant K: Selective pressure is not the same as preference
[2023-07-03, 14:10:55] Vamshi: Yeah another interesting question from the universal appeal of this line of reasoning.

Is it more in tune with the scientific spirit to ascribe agency to inanimate things or less scientific?
[2023-07-03, 14:11:03] ~ Shrey Goyal: But human biology did not change in order to accommodate tomatoes and coffee.
[2023-07-03, 14:11:11] Vamshi: The old selfish gene metaphor
[2023-07-03, 14:12:12] Vamshi: The dilemma being that the general understanding of “scientific” Is to not ascribe agency to the generative processes that create agency
[2023-07-03, 14:13:28] Vamshi: Would you agree?
[2023-07-03, 14:15:44] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This may not be true. We do have a gut biome that has evolved significantly
[2023-07-03, 14:16:06] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: And the story of human evolution is a story of co-evolution. We change just as we change the world
[2023-07-03, 14:16:10] Ciyunni: Guns, Germs, and Steel: The Fates of Human Societies
1997 book by Jared Diamond
[2023-07-03, 14:16:20] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Like Douglas Hofstafter’s Drawing hands
[2023-07-03, 14:16:48] ~ Shrey Goyal: But large parts of the population, including most people here, did not encounter tomatoes in their systems until the Colombian exchange a few centuries ago.
[2023-07-03, 14:16:52] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: With humans and AI, we will evolve with AI as it evolves. Our societal roles and jobs and things will change
[2023-07-03, 14:17:31] ~ Shrey Goyal: One of the ideas that comes up when trying to study how plants are dealing with climate change is that ascribing personalities and even metaphorically assigning agency (e. g. saying "plants are dealing with climate change") changes the way scientific and policy decisions get made.
[2023-07-03, 14:17:32] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Guy biota change many times in the course of a single human lifetime
[2023-07-03, 14:17:33] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: We have as a species acquired this trait over millennia of evolution
[2023-07-03, 14:17:51] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: *gut biota
[2023-07-03, 14:18:33] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Or even fermented foods. There’s gotta be a good reason humans didn’t avoid them - because they found a use for them eventually
[2023-07-03, 14:20:06] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Tomatoes didn't come to India till less than a century ago.
[2023-07-03, 14:20:27] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Anecdotally the Flynn effect is recorded by many people and societies around the world. Many kids are seen to be “smarter” than kids of previous generations. This could be owed to nutrition levels but could also be owed to evolutionary patterns. After all every generation of humans is finding their own ecological niches like other generations before them
[2023-07-03, 14:20:35] Ciyunni: it's still anthropomorphism ... rhizomic narrative or indigenous narrative, differing cosmogonies, sound very different - try Sophie Strand or Bayo Akomolofe (Chennai/Lagos).
[2023-07-03, 14:20:55] Nirant K: Aiyo, "fermented foods" — even monkeys eat spoiled fruit because primates love getting drunk
[2023-07-03, 14:20:56] ~ Shrey Goyal: Exactly why I didn't say they came less than a century ago.
‎[2023-07-03, 14:21:07] Krishna Panchal: ‎image omitted
[2023-07-03, 14:21:15] Nirant K: In fact, my favourite conspiracy theory is that all cities exist so that people can drink
[2023-07-03, 14:21:46] Vamshi: So true for all the AI policy stuff, it’s especially challenging when a system becomes fully connected to an open world, and creates graft onto the existing 

Seconds order cybernetics had some ideas here…
[2023-07-03, 14:22:03] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Not accidental fermentation but deliberate. That process takes a while to experiment and evolve as well. Like cheeses, yogurt and other dairy products that aren’t necessarily liquor or alcohol infused
[2023-07-03, 14:22:05] Vamshi: Hahaha this is like reverse Terrence McKenna
[2023-07-03, 14:22:18] Ciyunni: paleo gut biomes were significantly different - https://www.nature.com/articles/s42003-021-01689-y
[2023-07-03, 14:23:05] Vamshi: And also right on the money with fermented foods and the gut biome
[2023-07-03, 14:24:10] Vamshi: Which are basically a dispensary for endogenous entheogens
[2023-07-03, 14:26:39] ~ Shrey Goyal: In the CC example, the issue is that by saying X can't survive temperatures above 32 °C, you're implicitly blaming X instead of blaming the agent that took it all the way to 32. And that affects how decisions are made, including decisions regarding whether further research funding should be allocated at all.
[2023-07-03, 14:27:09] ~ Shrey Goyal: So too with AI, ie, AI is good, AI is bad, AI will help/harm us… etc.
[2023-07-03, 14:29:02] Vamshi: Very true
[2023-07-03, 14:29:50] Vamshi: What I was highlighting, also is the possible near future scenario where embodied robots with deep understanding of their energetic needs and self sufficiency can create a true artificial ecology
[2023-07-03, 14:30:32] Vamshi: Once they are empowered to understand the energy equation with intelligence, they are an ecological citizen of the planet
[2023-07-03, 14:30:45] Vamshi: And suddenly the agency argument is moot
[2023-07-03, 14:33:54] Vamshi: Of course co-evolution would mean that for every ultron scenario we would develop the corresponding Ironman
[2023-07-03, 14:34:36] Vamshi: And one ethics must evolve appropriately with the new found prowess
[2023-07-03, 14:34:43] Vamshi: *our
[2023-07-03, 14:37:53] Vamshi: Ok maybe I got a bit carried away with the “near future” part 😄
[2023-07-03, 14:40:09] Ciyunni: few hundred years or 1-2 millennia is still near future, Vamshi.
[2023-07-03, 14:40:55] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Not necessarily. Coevolution is multi-adversarial but there’s no guarantee that it is going to result in mutual survival.
[2023-07-03, 14:43:27] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Framed in this way the AI alarmist vs AI maximalist debate looks to be about two extremes of this coevolutionary phenomenon involving humans on the one hand and AI systems on the other. Or humans wielding AI on the one hand and regular humans on the other.
[2023-07-03, 14:44:31] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: AI alarmism assumes that humans are playing with something they don’t understand and AI maximalism sees AI as a technology capability to be exploited. The truth is somewhere in the middle with positive and negative outcomes both emerging from the interplay
[2023-07-03, 14:52:32] Vamshi: Coming to a real near future scenario, I think some of the concerns come from the potential disruption from autonomous agents as true economic citizens as opposed too ecological citizens (which is still fortunately sci-fi).

A trans-national currency with relative liquidity within the key supply chains seems central.

I’m genuinely not sure whether this is where the whole worldcoin thing comes in - anyone informed on this front ?
[2023-07-03, 15:08:00] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Much harder problem given the state of the world - geopolitics and economics are closely linked. Reserve currencies sustained as the petrodollar are losing ground and crypto has done nothing of note in this space. For the time being it looks like there will be multiple islands of global trade for the foreseeable future.
[2023-07-03, 15:08:13] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This would be a digression from AI policy and philosophy so I'll let it go

[2023-07-03, 21:02:23] Vamshi: It’s refreshing that a lot of people in the group are carefully skeptical of writing by big names.
[2023-07-03, 21:03:49] Vamshi: Having said that Douglas Hofstader did a great job of popularising thing that were considered math nerd or linguistics nerd talk at one point, he brings back memories of coffee table conversations.
[2023-07-03, 21:03:58] Vamshi: *things
[2023-07-03, 21:05:06] Vamshi: I like that he has reservations about things which are very low level intuitions. The intuitions of a math mechanic.
Except from your link:
“And I would never have thought that deep thinking could come out of a network that only goes in one direction, out of firing neurons in only one direction.”
[2023-07-03, 21:06:56] Vamshi: Granted it’s very hand wavy and totally lacking in any rigour
[2023-07-03, 21:07:24] Vamshi: *excerpt
[2023-07-03, 21:35:02] Abhishek Mishra: Why do we expect machines to imitate organic matter?
None of the planes we have are flying because they flap wings like a bird. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-07-03, 21:35:46] Abhishek Mishra: That's one of the biggest examples of mis-attributed logic by analogies and not first principles thinking.
[2023-07-03, 21:52:02] Gokul Krishnan: Problem is, we don't have anything close to first principles of intelligence/sentience/consciousness
[2023-07-03, 21:59:20] Abhishek Mishra: True, we have many hypothesis for the same. However, when there are too many options, it's best to know what it definitely isn't.

Intelligence is not competence. You don't claim a machine to be intelligent just because it can do a job that humans can do. Likewise, it's not right to expect AGI to be good at everything. Intelligence, as per our experience, is capability to learn, adapt and carry forward information from our experiences.
[2023-07-03, 22:01:36] Abhishek Mishra: Anyway, I'm well aware that we don't understand our own consciousness/intelligence well enough to claim what is right here. And I don't want to give my definition of intelligence and claim it's right, which is most likely incorrect.
[2023-07-03, 22:02:12] Vamshi: I think we’re still at the point where we’re building wings before the flapping part though, there’s biologically identical versus biologically inspired, and a lot of engineering is biologically inspired.
[2023-07-03, 22:03:26] Abhishek Mishra: Two systems can work to achieve the same outcome because they follow the same principles but need not be the same in design.
[2023-07-03, 22:04:20] Abhishek Mishra: Aerodynamics is what is present in both cases, but the organic structure of a fly vs a bird vs a bee vs a plane can all vary and thus requires different designs to succeed.
[2023-07-03, 22:04:21] Vamshi: I do think that Hofstader was a great map at the time he wrote the popular stuff, but things are moving so far now, we’ll need an entirely different medium to serve as a crystal ball.
[2023-07-03, 22:05:20] Vamshi: *so fast
[2023-07-03, 22:07:55] Vamshi: The idea of first principles is the real challenge here where we’re seeing results first and then figuring out the principles later
[2023-07-03, 22:08:03] Vamshi: It has really turned the tables
[2023-07-03, 22:08:38] Vamshi: Advances in mechanistic interpretability could be the new crystal ball
[2023-07-03, 22:09:24] Vamshi: Kinda finally completing the human-AI feedback loop
[2023-07-03, 22:10:08] Vamshi: Again, some of these ideas were proposed in a very a very abstract sense in second order cybernetics
[2023-07-03, 22:10:26] Vamshi: But it seemed unrelatable to real systems
[2023-07-03, 22:11:18] Vamshi: English or natural language as user interface seems extremely low throughout -

[2023-07-05, 23:52:35] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Sometimes earlier When I used to tell GPT to do certain things and it refused on certain grounds.

[2023-07-06, 00:02:41] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Haan maybe some open source model might help in such cases
[2023-07-06, 00:03:14] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Or long hacky prompts which give unhibited results are out there

[2023-07-06, 02:21:50] Abhishek Sahu Ultrahuman: Question: Isn’t Asimov’s laws too broad to be even slightly useful for current state of alignment?

hypothetical scenario:
(with a few assumptions included)

If someone asks GPT-X (superintelligence), to destroy a specific resource from planet earth that is necessary for human survival (the resource may exist in the present or in the future). It might do so without technically disobeying the First law, as it may accomplish the goal without injuring (physical harm) humans.
[2023-07-06, 02:26:35] Gokul Krishnan: If we as non-superintelligent humans know a resource is crucial for our survival, why wouldn't a benevolence superintelligent AI not be aware of it?

If there's no plausible explanation, then your premise can't exist and Asimov's first law would still prevent it from destroying us
[2023-07-06, 02:27:01] Gokul Krishnan: Not be aware of the same fact, that is
[2023-07-06, 02:27:57] Gokul Krishnan: Not a believer of the  superintelligence soon trope but excited to see what'll come of this
[2023-07-06, 02:28:53] Gokul Krishnan: Probably the first things to solve would be scalable model verification and control. Both of which would make DL adoption in boring yet vital usecases a possibility
[2023-07-06, 02:29:35] Gokul Krishnan: Not to mention interpretability and robustness as well
[2023-07-06, 02:34:25] ~ Shrey Goyal: You're right, Asimov’s laws only provide simple, foundational basis for understanding ethical robot behaviour, and were mainly for containing sci-fi plot points.  

The first law doesn’t address indirect harm or the timeframe in which the harm occurs. Real-world AI ethics needs more detailed rules that can account for indirect harm, long-term consequences, and the system’s interpretation of the instructions.
[2023-07-06, 02:35:00] ~ Shrey Goyal: This is part of what AI alignment research is supposed to accomplish: creating AI that understands and respects human values and priorities, even in complex scenarios.
[2023-07-06, 02:35:13] Abhishek Sahu Ultrahuman: The point I’m making is that it’s too broad and was thought for robots and not exactly for superintelligence. When you say “harm”, what exactly do you want the model to understand from it? At what probability threshold of “harm” and it’s similiar meanings should the model block?
[2023-07-06, 02:35:22] Abhishek Sahu Ultrahuman: Exactly.

[2023-07-06, 09:16:29] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Saw the Emad Mostaque interview with Bloomberg. Got the distinct sense that the hit piece was done earlier in Forbes so that they could push him into a corner in the interview. At least two questions related to that hit piece, and barely anything of substance otherwise. Bloomberg and Forbes would have had a view of who’s interested in investing and there is a lot at stake for other AI startups.
[2023-07-06, 09:17:58] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: A fast growing successful company that’s built on top of a good network curated by the founders or GTM channels has much to lose from media attention these days. And little to gain IMO
[2023-07-06, 09:31:51] Nirant K: Don't assume malice what can be explained by ignorance
[2023-07-06, 09:32:17] Nirant K: And don't assume competence, where sensationalism is explanation enough 🤣 ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-07-06, 09:32:33] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Nirant’s Razor
[2023-07-06, 09:38:16] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yeah, fair points. That said, these are publications that both have a lot of investment data, and are also media houses that can play a role in shaping the narrative about companies. I see that as an "interaction effect" from where I am
[2023-07-06, 09:40:33] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Reminds me of the regulators who received scrutiny in 2008. Many regulators used to work for banks, and went back to working for banks after the crisis. Probably a stretch and I'm probably overthinking it (hence the need for an Occam's razor?)
[2023-07-06, 10:18:41] Nirant K: Axioms: 
a16z is a media company which runs VC investments, Marcellus is a media company which runs a PMS in India, 
McKinsey is modern illuminati with more influence than money

Extrapolating: 
America is a corporation pretending to be a civilisation (hence the kindness towards corporates), 
China is a tribe pretending to be a civilisation, 
India is many lost civilisations pretending to be a single alive civilisation ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-07-06, 10:23:28] Abhishek Mishra: Too vague of an emoji I guess. It's just influencers and their threads influencing the game.

You may add the questions or suggestions you want to provide, thanks!
[2023-07-07, 11:13:14] Divya Tak: What are the key questions that you are already asking?
[2023-07-07, 11:23:39] ~ Prajna Prayas: It's very early for them also. I am planning to make sure when the regulations come they are not too suffocating and they know the context. So I will probably discuss about how they pressurised the recent Digital Data Protection Bill to be less draconian, how do these lawer-y things work, may be I will inform them how EU and others thinking about regulations etc.
[2023-07-07, 11:24:36] Divya Tak: What is the current state of copyright in india as it relates to AI?
[2023-07-07, 11:25:13] Divya Tak: Or will these policy recommendations go beyond copyright
[2023-07-07, 11:25:24] Divya Tak: Because i think there are some labour considerations etc too?
[2023-07-07, 11:29:37] ~ Prajna Prayas: The Japanese say there are no copyright violations though
[2023-07-07, 12:22:11] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: We should add Apar here :D
[2023-07-07, 12:23:23] Divya Tak: yea i know i just meant, what areas are you going to be talking about. there is copyright which is obvious, and then labour?
[2023-07-07, 12:35:31] ~ Prajna Prayas: Data privacy is something they are more concerned about. And Data Localisation also. Lets see how far I can go. I will keep here posted
[2023-07-07, 12:42:29] Divya Tak: Ah makes sense. Training set regulations?
[2023-07-07, 12:47:41] ~ Prajna Prayas: Yes. I guess they will be more concerned about the recent Digital data Protection bill that is going to be shortly and how can AI fit in.

1. The govt. has constituted a few working groups to bring in regulations in this space. Very little info is available about them as of now.
2. The NGO's goal is on mitigating the immediate threat of AI which consists of Facial Recognition and Fraud detection and accountability of user data.
3. They have not given sufficient thought to generative AI space as of yet.

Justice Timothy Keene, presiding over the case, acknowledged the non-traditional nature of using an emoji as a signature but concluded that it met the criteria for conveying the two purposes of a signature: confirmation and acceptance.

I would love to hear opinions around fastest methods to setup a vector DB and deploy a container hosting some LlamaIndex code. That would be really helpful in allowing us to use better models.
[2023-07-11, 10:00:56] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Is the lite version using RAG? I mean is it scraping the data from website of companies to generate answers or is it a chat completions end point ? 

If it’s using chat completions end point it would explain why Dev was not able to find his company and also explain the hallucinations

[2023-07-11, 11:02:08] Ambika Computational Mama: i run on this simple theory that if we say "it takes a village to raise a child" then why not apply the same funda to AI. Imagine an AI that is raised with good values and a sense of justice!

[2023-07-11, 11:05:47] Nirant K: good value => my values, and since all AI is American, I believe those born in 2000s are the last generation of Indians — every generation from this point on will be too American or too against it to be distinctly Indian

[2023-07-11, 13:00:07] Vamshi: I would think atleast some elements of the two (AI and web 3) are a perfect match
[2023-07-11, 13:00:22] Vamshi: But buried for the same reason mentioned above
[2023-07-11, 13:00:30] Vamshi: Too volatile and politically incorrect
[2023-07-11, 13:01:29] Nirant K: No, that wasn't the issue with web3. The issue was that it's a scam
[2023-07-11, 13:01:53] Nirant K: And there is no real utility to it
[2023-07-11, 13:02:08] Vamshi: I’m talking about the technology not the way it was used
[2023-07-11, 13:02:23] Vamshi: Same as P2P file sharing
[2023-07-11, 13:03:14] Vamshi: Absolutely true that it got hijacked by pirates
[2023-07-11, 13:03:19] Vamshi: Hence the analogy
[2023-07-11, 13:03:42] Nirant K: Fair, that's somewhat true
[2023-07-11, 13:07:21] Vamshi: If we start to put legal machinery similar to companies for agents, eventually there will be overlap with the infra that was emerging in crypto
[2023-07-11, 13:07:44] Vamshi: Treating an agent as a legal entity
[2023-07-11, 13:08:45] Vamshi: That’s where I think things are pretty volatile and where the public dialogue is not pretty, and hence avoided by people who are likely to lead such conversations
[2023-07-11, 13:09:40] Vamshi: Because it can pull things into the same quicksand
[2023-07-11, 13:10:08] Vamshi: This is where the idea of “it takes a village to raise a child” is likely to be ignored
[2023-07-11, 13:10:41] Vamshi: And where DAOs were relevant to an agent mediated commerce world
[2023-07-11, 13:11:29] Vamshi: Decision by committee lead to hijacking of the protocols by frauds
[2023-07-11, 13:11:42] Gokul Krishnan: P2P wasn't the same story as web3. P2P was killed in the US by the movie and music industries lobbying. It's still strong in Europe
[2023-07-11, 13:12:17] Gokul Krishnan: And this is not a new story. Much of American Copyright law is influenced by Disney
[2023-07-11, 13:13:04] Divya Tak: IMO blockchain/Web3 was adding additional barriers of entry to systems that are not broken, while GenAI is improving people's ability to make things that they otherwise would have needed experts on or needed to spend years learning. Web3 is not the same from a usability, utility and impact pov.
[2023-07-11, 13:13:53] Divya Tak: There is an awesome interview with the founder/owner of pirate bay in darknet diaries. For anyone who is interested in it ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-07-11, 13:15:36] Gokul Krishnan: There's a 1hr+ documentary as well, TPB AFK https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=eTOKXCEwo_8
[2023-07-11, 13:16:01] Divya Tak: Oohh thanks! will check out
[2023-07-11, 13:20:19] Vamshi: Oh that’s interesting - I didn’t know about the Europe part. 

My analogy was that the people maintaining the status quo (media industry in case of p2p vs regular currency and governing bodies in the case of web3), didn’t have a smooth transition path without a serious disruption of the status quo.

Until someone came along and did the political homework first, the pirates went to town in both cases.
[2023-07-11, 13:21:57] Vamshi: Asked differently, what would be the alternative to the blockchain for algorithmic governance of agents
[2023-07-11, 13:22:38] Vamshi: Is there a new architecture for algorithmic governance ? (That includes human in the loop)
[2023-07-11, 13:22:54] Vamshi: If so, it’s better to discuss that in the context of policy
[2023-07-11, 13:34:58] Vamshi: For me, the connecting dot is the influence of culture in economics, commerce, decision making and politics.

This goes back to the idea of the homogenous-ation of culture as well (“everyone’s becoming American” etc).

Any mechanism for governance where we start to codify legal recognition of agents must factor this.
[2023-07-11, 13:37:00] Vamshi: The fact that humans are emotional decision makers rather than purely rational, that is
[2023-07-11, 13:40:16] Vamshi: Any opinions on how worldcoin fits in (or doesn’t) ?
[2023-07-11, 13:41:03] Nirant K: That's a surveillance program, much like the one Nazis had (no exaggeration)
[2023-07-11, 13:41:23] Vamshi: There we go
[2023-07-11, 13:41:26] Vamshi: 😄
[2023-07-11, 13:42:04] Vamshi: Zero trust - your only saviour
[2023-07-11, 13:43:32] Vamshi: Never mind the algorithmic complexity
[2023-07-11, 13:45:07] Vamshi: Everyone just forego having kids to keep the homomorphic computation and next generation models running
[2023-07-11, 13:58:14] Vamshi: I think I’ve down graded a few generations and become a “baby doomer”
[2023-07-11, 14:31:26] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Is innovation in AI behind closed doors a bigger threat than Chinese LLM competitors to GPT?
[2023-07-11, 14:33:23] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Baby doomer is a superb term. Going to use it liberally in conversations where people make arguments against having kids altogether because nuance has already been defenestrated
[2023-07-11, 14:48:43] Aditya Sista 2010B5: The problem with web3 is that there are very few use cases where computing the same code over and over again for "trust" has very few use cases, the "decentralization " in web3 has different meaning than what most people think. It's actually making simple computations expensive to execute, since you're executing the same computation everywhere as opposed to on a centralized server.
[2023-07-11, 14:49:57] Aditya Sista 2010B5: Any innovation that came out of web3, involved same form of centralization. Which goes against their ethos.
[2023-07-11, 14:54:47] ~ Shrey Goyal: Baby doomers with their millennihilism
[2023-07-11, 15:11:48] Gokul Krishnan: That's a lot of jargon packed into one sentence. Care to elaborate on each?
[2023-07-11, 15:18:20] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: And I think crypto made governments either wary of it or try to actively use it for their centralization agendas
[2023-07-11, 17:22:45] Vamshi: That was only English. Baby doomer on the other hand is intended to be technical usage. Creative Commons licensed 😄
[2023-07-11, 17:23:11] Vamshi: Let me try and get the idea across again -
[2023-07-11, 17:26:08] ~ Shrey Goyal: What other system could we use instead of blockchain to control how automated systems make decisions?

Was this basically it, @918971040239 ?
[2023-07-11, 17:31:38] Vamshi: Yes, soon similar lines - blockchain was designed to encapsulate contracts.
[2023-07-11, 17:31:49] Vamshi: *along
[2023-07-11, 17:32:51] Prashanth Harshangi Encrypt AI: Particularly also for foundational models and how powerful they are in causing misinformation and deepfakes (even the open source ones). Usage auditing of such released models via block chain /ledger like system.
[2023-07-11, 17:49:17] Vamshi: This new generation of AI, is similarly positioned to decompose concerns in a pretty fine grained way.

Companies are almost already autonomous agents in a legal sense, though not in an AI sense.

The crypto efforts evolved a fairly sophisticated infrastructure to trade contracts.

It also attempted to generalise the idea of an autonomous agent (from company to DAO), to be regulated with algorithmically tradable contracts.
[2023-07-11, 17:50:01] Vamshi: However, trade and currency don’t form a complete system of governance
[2023-07-11, 17:54:39] Vamshi: Currencies are stabilised by a complex system that involves not just “self-regulated” behaviour from currency and commerce, but emotionally regulated behaviour that comes from very deep-rooted human institutions - cultural institutions, religious institutions and the nation state.
[2023-07-11, 17:57:48] Vamshi: The ability to use an AI agent to evolve much smarter contracts which are tradable, will move more (not all) governance to the self-regulating mode, and create a more efficient ways for humans to get into the loop on the decision making.
[2023-07-11, 17:59:59] Vamshi: My point was that all this infra was already in development in the crypto community, and that it will re-emerge as being particularly relevant as we along.
[2023-07-11, 18:00:24] Vamshi: Obviously emotions will never go away
[2023-07-11, 18:00:36] Vamshi: Unless we become Vulcan
[2023-07-11, 18:02:58] Vamshi: I don’t mean to anthropomorphise AI here, merely giving them the same “citizen“ or constitutional status
[2023-07-11, 18:03:13] Vamshi: Similar to companies and DAOs
[2023-07-11, 18:06:19] Vamshi: Or communities
[2023-07-11, 20:07:14] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: There is a saying that if you have to prove your religion is a religion and not a cult, it's a cult. Web3 is a scam, and any further explanation (by whoever hasn't pivoted to AI) will just prove it further
[2023-07-11, 20:30:36] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: A big believer in cryptography though
[2023-07-11, 20:31:39] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: As soon as I see a post on the a16z website, I'm blindly buying shorts.
[2023-07-11, 21:04:01] ~ Bhaskar: I'd go as far to say that crypto and block chain is a doomsday tool - where your organisations are bound to fall apart and when zero trust is the only way to go.

Yet, it also can help abstract the lowest layers of governance to avoid collusion at some scale. Which can be super helpful for the agents usecase you're speaking of. 
Also can be anarchic if it takes the wrong turn: zero trust in the lower governance layers to avoid collusion
[2023-07-11, 21:38:11] Gokul Krishnan: So you're short on GenAI? 😉
[2023-07-11, 21:40:00] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Short on web3 not Cryptography. Short on whatever media term they come up with, not GenAI.
[2023-07-11, 21:48:48] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Too much focus on crypto/Web3 not enough on decentralisation 
Sometimes it’s more like a solution in search of a problem 


Why to even go to the extent of zkp,AI meditated commerce ? Look no further than ONDC for decentralisation of commerce 

Although not perfect it seems like step in right direction

[2023-07-12, 15:02:07] Nirmal GenAI group: off-topic. but a small clarification there, most Vulcans are still capable of emotions (though they don't express). only the ones who completely follow kolinahr are meant to purge all the emotions.
[2023-07-12, 16:04:55] Vamshi: Wow so much action here!
[2023-07-12, 16:05:49] Vamshi: Haha it’s true. I doubt even they’d be able to resist reacting to post-crash crypto-revival talk
[2023-07-12, 16:05:52] Vamshi: Feelings are strong

[2023-07-13, 18:15:00] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: The problem with ai driven societal change is that it's happening too rapidly, especially for older workers.

I don't have an answer and ai innovation must continue but we as a society need to really grapple with it and "think hard on how to adapt to these transformational changes"

Maybe better discussed further in the philosophy group

[2023-07-13, 18:29:26] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This is unavoidable when the incentives for innovators is to move fast. We have a notion of innovation and change as being fundamentally good things. This may not be a notion to hold constantly. There are many situations where innovation and change brings enough disruption to make it a net negative.

[2023-07-13, 19:02:29] ~ Prajna Prayas: Ashish I won't be really concerned about job loss issues since you know, most of the companies in India run on Google Sheets and gmail and they hardly spend on automation as the VP needs someone to blame if things go South
[2023-07-13, 19:07:36] Aaditya Sood Sequoia: IMO Innovation and change are fundamentally good things _in the long term_, when averaged out
[2023-07-13, 19:23:45] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: It is a helpful mental model for sure. The pace of change and disruption are also important factors in how these disruptions work in the long run for society at large
[2023-07-13, 19:28:29] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Maybe the introduction of the steam engine and the printing press were "painful for the society" in the initial years after their introduction but on a large enough timescale, they have been "net positives" in the arc of the evolution of our society

[2023-07-14, 21:45:47] Gokul Krishnan: Talking about the long term, we've never seen such high rates of Innovation (since the industrial revolution) in the many thousand years of history and many more in prehistory so I don't think it's as tautological as portrayed
[2023-07-14, 21:46:50] Nirant K: underrated risk dimension

[2023-07-15, 11:01:19] Divya Tak: Well. There is no evidence of his hypothesis. It's not right until proven wrong. Yuval is a good storyteller, but not very solid on the truth stuff

[2023-07-15, 11:05:38] Divya Tak: "this seems like a reasonable explanation" isn't the same as "this is the right explanation"

[2023-07-15, 11:52:04] ~ Shrey Goyal: Harari is a point on the spectrum between Malcolm Gladwell and Nassim Nicholas Taleb.
[2023-07-15, 11:59:43] Soumendra Dhanee: Taleb is way too overrated to occupy an endpoint on that spectrum
[2023-07-15, 11:59:50] ~ Shrey Goyal: I would say that Gladwell and Harari are pop-non-fic gurus who pick topics with chaotic jumbles of data and events, allowing them to spin whatever narrative they like and oversimplify complex realities for the sake of a good story, but I'm not Harari.
[2023-07-15, 12:00:23] ~ Shrey Goyal: But that's the point, that they're all on the same spectrum.
[2023-07-15, 12:00:31] Soumendra Dhanee: Taleb is not too far from this
[2023-07-15, 12:00:53] Soumendra Dhanee: Yes yes, agree with them being on the same spectrum
[2023-07-15, 12:01:20] Soumendra Dhanee: But Taleb doesn't occupy the endpoint opposite to Gladwell

[2023-07-15, 12:23:33] Anshul Bhide Replit: Was relistening to Naval's podcast with Joe Rogan from 4 years ago. Here's what he had to say about AI - essentially we're far away and there's no way AI can write code. My interpretation might be a little trite but curious to know what others think.

[2023-07-15, 12:26:09] Anshul Bhide Replit: but its interesting to see naval's take on this proven wrong (?)
[2023-07-15, 12:27:29] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: It’s our fault that we take someone so seriously just because they’ve had success in some other field
[2023-07-15, 12:27:35] Adithya L Bhat Hackathon: Well the only thing I can take from this is not to listen to anybody about what’s feasible/ not feasible unless tried and proven .

[2023-07-15, 12:29:18] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: More than the phenomenon of unviable startups,the biggest problem of ZIRP era was hero worship of tech leaders/VCs as thought leaders 

Their word were taken as pronouncements of future visionaries
[2023-07-15, 12:32:05] Adithya L Bhat Hackathon: Wrong era to worship. 😂 best era to worship someone according to me would be when they’re actively trying to control inflation . Visionary leaders can probably be spotted here . Driving the necessities forward.
[2023-07-15, 12:33:21] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: India is full of Naval, Balaji fanboys and also I saw many desi versions of Twitter accounts who just recycle their tweets.
[2023-07-15, 12:34:00] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Also when material interests lie in selling a story ,thought leadership is just a marketing gimmick 

Ex CDixon from a16z who was a big crypto proponent and isn’t seen anywhere now

[2023-07-15, 12:36:14] Adithya L Bhat Hackathon: So how does one be a visionary leader ? Is it just building valuable things ?
[2023-07-15, 12:36:40] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: They don't just recycle their tweets. They repurpose them into threads.
[2023-07-15, 12:37:14] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: I think the point is you can be a visionary leader in your field of expertise 
But that doesn’t mean your opinion on other topics grants you the status of expert
[2023-07-15, 12:37:17] Adithya L Bhat Hackathon: Yea I have fallen into this trap many times. 😅

[2023-07-15, 12:38:31] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: What is Naval’s filed of expertise, I'm just asking because I don't think he is on top of any filed.
[2023-07-15, 12:38:33] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Slightly off topic, but ever since Twitter released in their algorithm that threads and tweets with pics are promoted and hashtags are not, seeing this a lot. Too many threadbois
[2023-07-15, 12:39:44] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: I think it’s only because of Naval Twitter brought the threads feature

[2023-07-15, 12:49:36] Aditya Sista 2010B5: It does, its quite well known phenomenon in psychology. Hiding behind any tag made most humans so far do things that they'd never do by themselves. The most original tag was probably 'religion '

[2023-07-15, 13:58:37] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Reading that Yuval Noah Harari article, my take is, that is designed to be sensationalist and it asks for government regulation department on LLMs but doesn't go far into how this department would work. 
My take
I don't care about hypotheticals of AI doom. Doesn't mean I'm dismissing it, rather it means too much talk is overrated. There are various human created scenarios which lead to the hypotheticals of AI doom. I would rather prefer talk of how this planned regulation would look like and implemented and then you can know what they actually mean, what is their skin in the game.
‎[2023-07-15, 14:07:12] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: ‎image omitted
[2023-07-15, 14:09:54] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: My point is that, why only devote the last couple of paragraphs for how the proposed regulation should work?
I would have preferred more information on how the author thinks, such scenarios can be mitigated by government regulation, public awareness etc.
I mean there can be multiple scenarios of aI doom. But this is all talk. I want to see talk of how you think this can be regulated if this is what you call for
[2023-07-15, 14:09:58] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: What is interesting about the other hypothesis here of human cultures using AI generated ideas to organize their own society and culture - seems profound but this has been happening for years. As the tools which should be extensions of us become more powerful and more intelligent, we ask the question of the value and worth of human endeavour more and more, and this is not surprising too. Perhaps what we need are new frontiers where to point the collective potential of human endeavours, rather than a red ocean competition between humans and AI systems.
[2023-07-15, 14:11:41] ~ Arko Cy: Really good read with a fairly nice logical breakdown
[2023-07-15, 14:11:48] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yes, I agree. In the words of Hrongar of Whiterun, "All this standing around is rubbish! We should be taking the fight to them" (game/Skyrim reference). Then again pieces like this are popular not because of the content merely but where it came from. Nature of the machine.
[2023-07-15, 14:27:14] ~ Shrey Goyal: The two doom and gloom treasure troves today are AI and climate change. The difference is that doomsday scenarios around CC revolve mostly around Known Knowns and some Known Unknowns.  We know why CC is happening, can already see the clear and present dangers, and have a pretty good idea about what it could lead to, and when. 

Risks from AI are more speculative, either through known unknowns (what is the timeline for AGI), or unknown unknowns (entirely new risks that we can't consider with any confidence yet).

That makes the wider discourse on CC more focused on policy and concrete changes, while most public discussions on AI cannot help being abstract conjectures and speculative debating. Any suggestions of immediate policy changes or specific action steps re: AI would still mostly be low-confidence conjectures that we'll have to throw out wholesale every few months when something new comes to light.
[2023-07-15, 14:30:49] ~ Shrey Goyal: In terms of public policy and decision-making, the American model tends to be the "letter of the law" approach, which is the more popular model today. Seeking that for AI is a lost cause.
[2023-07-15, 14:31:58] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Much of climate change thinking and approach is also very narrow imho.  The rare earth metals being used for the EVs, solar and wind energy have known issues in how they are being sourced, their side-effects and issues with disposability of batteries etc. congo is prime example
[2023-07-15, 14:33:32] ~ Shrey Goyal: The European model (thanks to the civil law tradition) leans towards the “spirit of the law” approach. The idea being to set principles with a willingness to interpret laws based on their intended outcomes or underlying goals. Any policy discussions on AI necessarily have to be less detailed and more general, providing more room for interpretation as situations change.
[2023-07-15, 14:38:24] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: When it comes to AI policy, it's also important to clarify to everyone what it means to train a model. And data collection etc. There's too much grey area there and it seems to benefit closed models more. These are stuff, you'd want to be more transparent in.
[2023-07-15, 14:42:43] ~ Shrey Goyal: These issues are well known and generally accounted for in policy negotiations. Congo is a good example because they have a detailed MoU in place now regarding battery supply chains and their (and Zambia's) agency. Not that more doesn't need to be done. 

And as good as EVs are, they're not considered or expected to be the biggest drivers for decarbonisation in mobility/transport. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-07-15, 14:46:07] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Mining conbalt for batteries is the only front-end dark-side, there is also the back-end (recycling) side that is equally devastating. The complexity of making ion-lithium batteries make it non-cost effective to recycle. Basically most used lithium batteries just get deposited in landfills where they eventually leach into the water tables. When we destroy our fresh water supply system, well grab your ankles.
[2023-07-15, 14:57:30] ~ Shrey Goyal: Again, there's a lot of tech as well as policy Innovation happening in this area. Recycling batteries is a growing industry now, because it's easier to mine batteries than ore, and a lot of this Infrastructure will be operational by the time the deluge of used batteries arrives around 2025. 

Not to make this a climate policy discussion group, the point is that other growing areas already have mechanisms to deal with issues as they emerge. The main challenge being inaction due to political cowardice and vested interests. 

AI is different because we don't really know where things are headed. It's not so much about *tough questions and difficult-to-swallow answers as it is about not having clarity on what questions to seek answers to. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-07-15, 15:04:35] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: I don’t agree with your analysis of human approach to climate change having mechanisms in place. We might be legit destroying the earth in what could be our limited understanding of progress. AI is no different. The problem is same, humans thinking they have it all figured
[2023-07-15, 15:05:04] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: But will not debate further since might be borderline off topic
[2023-07-15, 15:05:58] ~ Shrey Goyal: That also happens due to lack of technical know how on the policy side. Back in the day, FTX got themselves placed under commodity regulators whose expertise mainly lied in dealing with soybean farmers and maple syrup surplus. I can bet you there's at least one lawmaker serving on a committee for transparency in training AI models who hasn't figured out how to use email. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-07-15, 15:09:53] Nirant K: That's what we the people voted for fwiw
[2023-07-15, 15:37:11] Soumendra Dhanee: The AI revolution may be very different from all the past revolutions we have had, but one thing has always remained constant: in the time it takes the new tech to mature and be well-understood, many "historians" and "philosophers" of the day peddled doomerism for more eyeballs.
[2023-07-15, 15:38:08] Soumendra Dhanee: Sure, this AI revolution could be different in nature, but that doesn't make the usual doomers more right - people who don't do never get it right.
[2023-07-15, 15:38:43] ~ Shrey Goyal: Agree, but why the double inverted commas?
[2023-07-15, 15:39:29] Soumendra Dhanee: Oh, that was Harari's description in the article shared above that started the whole discussion today.
[2023-07-15, 15:41:21] Soumendra Dhanee: I'm not saying the doers should get a free pass, usually doers aren't well-equipped to think through consequences, but what I'm saying is, none of the doers were blocked in the past revolutions, let's not block them this time.
[2023-07-15, 15:44:22] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Does usually dont get the free pass. Capitalist and Market always keep them in check.
[2023-07-15, 15:47:59] Soumendra Dhanee: Free pass for the invention. A lot of these inventions happen at the cross-section of money and power, so usually it's not a problem, shouldn't be a problem this time either. The doomerism seems pretty strong though.
[2023-07-15, 15:48:54] ~ Shrey Goyal: Given that the guy has a BA, a PhD, and post-doctoral experience in history, has written several academic books and journal articles in history and social philosophy, and is currently a professor of history, I think it's reasonable to call him a historian and philosopher, no?
[2023-07-15, 15:52:25] Soumendra Dhanee: But I'm calling him a historian and a philosopher. I'm point out that the populist "historians" and "philosophers" of the day have usually peddled doomerism when new inventions happen.
[2023-07-15, 15:54:58] Soumendra Dhanee: (populist) historians and philosophers are specifically not doers, and the least equipped to understand radical breakthroughs, and have been wrong about stuff usually.
[2023-07-15, 15:56:22] Aditya Sista 2010B5: Geoffrey hinton left Google just to talk dormerism. He's one of the first people to work on backprop algorithm for feedforward networks. What about him?
[2023-07-15, 15:56:25] ~ Shrey Goyal: "Okay."
[2023-07-15, 15:57:27] Soumendra Dhanee: What about him? His position is very very different from Harari, and worth paying attention to.
[2023-07-15, 15:58:54] Aditya Sista 2010B5: My point is, harari may be going that way a bit too much this time because from his perspective, the creators of AI are also concerned. I don't think he has any vested interests in promoting doomerism.
[2023-07-15, 16:01:00] Soumendra Dhanee: He's fairly vested in promoting doomerism as he has made that his brand now. He has no basis for wildly over-speculating beyond the concerns of the creators of AI if that's indeed what's driving him.
[2023-07-15, 16:01:28] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I like the term dormerism, intentional or not. Take the doom out of doomerism and makes it look dorky
[2023-07-15, 16:02:53] ~ Shrey Goyal: The kinds of discussions that happen at 2 am in college *dorms*. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-07-16, 10:33:48] Alok Bishoyi: Forgive if this topic has been discussed prior, 
But as we exhaust or run out of human generated data to train on, do you foresee there's going to come a time sooner where nation states tax or add data training laws so that are restriction on any data generated by their citizens ?
[2023-07-16, 11:00:48] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: One approach that has been discussed is knowledge distillation where outputs from neural networks are used to train other neural networks
[2023-07-16, 11:01:41] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Another relevant policy is UBI - lots said about it elsewhere but it seems as though countries and policy makers will circumvent these responsibilities rather than actually abide by them, because of the naked power of the state.
[2023-07-16, 11:02:17] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I anticipate governments to actually charge or tax citizens for their data collection and management with the view that such a tax is justified given that it maintains law and order
[2023-07-16, 11:04:13] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I have wished in the past that I get compensated if and when I have to take calls that are from marketers or promoters or advertisers. Right now there are more incentives for creating annoyances of this nature than for avoiding them though.
[2023-07-16, 11:05:45] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: https://arxiv.org/abs/2306.08543
[2023-07-16, 11:05:48] ~ Mayank Gupta: If you think about it, modern nations are online eg. Twitter. And they have already started launching policies to restrict their data from being used for training!
[2023-07-16, 11:06:19] Alok Bishoyi: I am aware of distillation techniques, but how is it relevant in this context again ?
[2023-07-16, 11:07:19] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: If nations introduce such taxes, developers of models may circumvent some of these penalties or charges by leveraging distillation as an alternative to data collection for their models
[2023-07-16, 11:07:40] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Basically kicking the can up the road rather than down the road and transferring the risk upstream
[2023-07-16, 11:07:59] Alok Bishoyi: I see
[2023-07-16, 11:10:07] Alok Bishoyi: I was imagining more or less the contunuation along the lines of current data protection rules and GDPR,

Where companies beyond a scale have to trace and track every data that's collected and need explicit permissions/fees to train models on top of it.
[2023-07-16, 11:10:28] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: It is interesting and a rehash of the network state idea that Balaji Srinivasan talks about often. However his emphasis is on crypto maximalism and freedom but given crypto is practically dead there could be other ways to build such networks and communities. However these platforms have the disadvantage that they don’t control the policies at the most fundamental level in society that have to do with land, infrastructure, rule of law, industrial production. Nation states still do that.
[2023-07-16, 11:11:53] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yeah. The logical end of this line of policy reasoning is perhaps policy walls that prevent data collection for training. This is something I expect to see in Europe given that they love legislation of this nature that blocks unchecked progress
[2023-07-16, 11:13:00] Alok Bishoyi: You could have protocols/marketplace where if you want access to certain Indian datasets you pay a fee, that benefits the gov as well as the original platform on which it was collected ( if they choose to )
[2023-07-16, 11:13:06] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Elsewhere in the Middle East, India, rest of Asia or America I expect to see people on both ends of the spectrum. Some looking at the upsides and others looking at the downsides. Another nimby yimby debate basically
[2023-07-16, 11:13:50] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yeah that’s possible. But I don’t see a net positive for data producers such as individuals here
[2023-07-16, 11:14:34] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This seems to be a fight where companies are on one side and policy makers are on the other. And the incentives are around compensations to governments. Not rights and freedoms.
[2023-07-16, 11:15:23] Alok Bishoyi: The original aggregator platform could distribute to producers down the line.

You could also argue that in a indirect way it helps fill the govt coffers , hence yours too. But yeah
[2023-07-16, 11:16:26] Alok Bishoyi: Also I found this interesting, if it hasn't been discussed already on this group

[2023-07-19, 18:29:18] Paras Chopra Wingify: And how can we tell if it’s suffering?

How can we tell that anyone is suffering?

This gets us right into the zombie argument
[2023-07-19, 18:31:33] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Maybe when it's start to acknowledge that it's hallucinating ? confused ? 

Imo anything like that is related to consciousness

Currently models are intelligent but not concious. In this podcast they discuss this point too
[2023-07-19, 18:36:52] Adithya L Bhat Hackathon: We feel pain when we are suffering. Something that can be measured in our brain right . 
When it comes to knowing if an AI is conscious we might have to find something  , like a measure to  showcase its  difference in performance under similar conditions.
[2023-07-19, 18:37:20] Adithya L Bhat Hackathon: A bug that cannot be solved .
[2023-07-19, 18:40:03] Anubhav mishra Zupay: How are you certain that they are concious
[2023-07-19, 18:40:29] Anubhav mishra Zupay: How do we fundamentally measure consciousness ?
[2023-07-19, 18:45:46] Vamshi: This goes deeper than computation, and also is a physics question in a sense
[2023-07-19, 18:46:00] Vamshi: To the extent that physics is deeper than computation and intelligence
[2023-07-19, 18:46:08] Vamshi: There’s this interesting paper
[2023-07-19, 18:46:22] Vamshi: I wonder if we’ve discussed it here
[2023-07-19, 18:46:26] Vamshi: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_will_theorem
[2023-07-19, 18:46:42] Adithya L Bhat Hackathon: Not saying it’s conscious but since we try to measure it definitely will reach there as any metric measured will always get better .
[2023-07-19, 18:47:19] Vamshi: It doesn’t say anything about free itself (still talking about that paper), but establishes an equivalence between free of the constituents of matter and aggregates
[2023-07-19, 18:47:34] Vamshi: Very very fuzzy about this to be honest
[2023-07-19, 18:48:53] Vamshi: I think even the linguistics idea of “to be”, and the physics idea of “to be” and the category theory idea “to be” vs “to be defined” are too overloaded and interchanged in casual philosophical conversations
[2023-07-19, 18:49:31] Vamshi: There’s a lot of interesting changes in conclusions when you try to be very precise about “to be”
[2023-07-19, 18:50:56] Anubhav mishra Zupay: There's also a book, how to create a mind - haven't read it completely, might be relevant

[2023-07-19, 19:19:25] Aditya Sista 2010B5: Anyone here read "the origin of conscious with the breakdown of the bicameral mind"? Its a heavy read but the author puts a lot of compelling arguments that consciousness evolved side by side with language...not vision nor other senses.
[2023-07-19, 19:31:41] Ravi Srinivasan: Just read the Wiki article... Need to read more but am reminded of the bhoota kola performer in kantara... Wonder if that is what a bicameral mind would have been like
[2023-07-19, 21:30:35] Paras Chopra Wingify: Btw I wrote extensively on consciousness here https://notes.invertedpassion.com/_Start+here_#Consciousness+related
[2023-07-19, 21:30:56] Paras Chopra Wingify: My conclusion was that we would never build a theory of consciousness, akin to theory of relativity
[2023-07-19, 21:31:19] Paras Chopra Wingify: It’s because we understand everything in context of consciousness, so can’t understand consciousness itself (only experience it)
[2023-07-19, 21:32:01] Paras Chopra Wingify: https://notes.invertedpassion.com/Consciousness/Towards+building+a+theory+of+consciousness
[2023-07-19, 22:31:50] Aditya Sista 2010B5: You'd really like the book I suggested....it's very well written, the author builds up a chain of reasoning based on theology and history. For example he notes that all literary works before 3000 years ago...were basically poems, it's not because they were feeling artistic, but because the language wasn't precise enough, and that the biggest breakthrough of language was describing things that don't exist etc. And that language is ultimately linked to consciousness. On a separate note, Buddhism talks about non self and that conscious is a story generated by our mind to talk about ourselves, and eventually we just believed it exists after enough repetition.
[2023-07-19, 22:37:11] Aditya Sista 2010B5: His eventual implication is that consciousness is very new, and is a consequence of language evolution, information exchange, and hallucinations in the brain which were mistaken to be "God's voices", and that was the start of religion all over the world.
[2023-07-19, 22:40:08] Paras Chopra Wingify: I recall reading somewhere that his theories have been debunked
[2023-07-19, 22:41:20] Aditya Sista 2010B5: Point me to those, I've been looking for counter arguments against his claims.
[2023-07-19, 22:41:25] Paras Chopra Wingify: https://ask.metafilter.com/353376/Do-Neuroscientists-and-Bio-anthropologists-accept-reject-Bicameral-Mind/amp
[2023-07-19, 22:41:59] Paras Chopra Wingify: My stance is more panpsychist, so consciousness isn’t very special in that sense
[2023-07-19, 22:43:01] Paras Chopra Wingify: What it feels like a human is of course human exclusive but in biology there’s continuity and it’s hard to say where consciousness starts or stops
[2023-07-19, 22:43:17] Paras Chopra Wingify: Most likely it’s a continuum, like most biological phenkna
[2023-07-19, 22:43:20] Paras Chopra Wingify: Phenomena
[2023-07-19, 22:44:01] Aditya Sista 2010B5: You mean it will be like an emerging property once the brain becomes complex enough?
[2023-07-19, 22:44:19] Paras Chopra Wingify: https://www.researchgate.net/publication/311770445_Insects_have_the_capacity_for_subjective_experience
[2023-07-19, 22:45:20] Paras Chopra Wingify: No, more like evolution has repurposed something that exists out there for benefit of the organism

Almost how it repurposes other physical properties
[2023-07-19, 22:45:30] Paras Chopra Wingify: So consciousness for me is a property of the universe
[2023-07-19, 22:47:52] Aditya Sista 2010B5: Do you define conscious as knowledge of your own existence?
[2023-07-19, 22:48:22] Paras Chopra Wingify: It’s far from settled, but closest I’ve come to understand is this:

Consciousness is what information feels from the inside

Emergence has issues because physics puts constraints on what consciousness can be

https://notes.invertedpassion.com/Consciousness/Constraints+physical+laws+put+on+consciousness
[2023-07-19, 22:48:39] Paras Chopra Wingify: No, what it feels like to be.
[2023-07-19, 22:49:16] Paras Chopra Wingify: What you’re talking about is reflective consciousness. I’m talking about simple unitary experiences 

We can bundle more and more on top of it

[2023-07-19, 22:55:22] Aditya Sista 2010B5: Yeah I realized you are coming from vipassana side of things. I've been practicing for a while but I still remain a skeptic about consciousness existing in matter.
[2023-07-19, 22:59:46] Aditya Sista 2010B5: But then Sam Altman seems to think that intelligent is a property of matter, and Hinton thinks we're passing phase in the evolution of intelligence of the universe. They speak like its a property of matter. I'm open to those hypotheses as well.
[2023-07-19, 23:00:32] Ankur Pandey: I think usefulness of discovering what's conscious doesn't automatically imply reducing suffering. One needs to reconcile infinite ethics as well as quantify/order consciousness to reach that conclusion.

Having said that, if that's your motivation - have you come across concepts (in philosophy of self) like open individualism?
[2023-07-20, 00:16:36] Paras Chopra Wingify: Yeah I have.

There’s so many uncertainties about what kinds of things are capable of experiencing, having a self or suffering.

I’m starting out at a place where I know it exists for sure (farmed animals) and then continuing to think deeply about this issue.
[2023-07-20, 00:56:38] Ankur Pandey: ‎This message was deleted.
[2023-07-20, 00:59:41] Ankur Pandey: Agreed yes, but how does one go from the knowledge that some entities apart from humans also suffer (or experience stuff) to the moral imperative of reducing it?

If one starts from suffering, then invoking "who" is suffering is important. If it's - as open individualism suggests - always you! - then the moral imperative becomes way simpler.

(Open individualism doesn't pre supposes anything about what kind of entities have (first person) experiences. It say that whatever these entities are or were or will be - you (as an experiencing entity) are, were, them. (stating like this garbs it in religious words, oh well).) 

Now with the whole AGI / superintelligence / AI becoming consciousness business has few interesting followups

1. If an AI becomes conscious - its experience is your experience as well. 

2. (somewhat more pragmatic) If a superintelligence (doesn't have to be conscious) finds that open individualism is true => its automatically aligned!
[2023-07-20, 01:05:32] Anubhav mishra Zupay: I think consciousness is a balanced combination of 

IQ
EQ
Social Quotient 
Adversity Quotient ( typically the rough patch/ suffering and ability to come out of it) 

Agi as I see will have only 1 which is IQ or Max EQ and empathy to some extent SQ too. 

But AQ is not neurological completely, it's a combination of biology too.
[2023-07-20, 01:08:25] Anubhav mishra Zupay: So imo in case of Superintendent systems it will be a combination of AGI + Human brain. Essentially let's say ( A nano chip that runs a Quantum AGI model with Neuralink. Maybe something like that
[2023-07-20, 01:31:19] Paras Chopra Wingify: Moral imperative to reduce suffering is independent of it, not a derived conclusion.

[2023-07-20, 14:01:09] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Individual 4090 is not far away from A100, it is the Nvilink that makes the difference, that's why crowdsourced training is not working out on Foundation model level
[2023-07-20, 14:01:50] Aditya Sista 2010B5: I've delved into this problem 2 years ago...there were tokens that rent out compute
[2023-07-20, 14:03:19] Aditya Sista 2010B5: https://www.golem.network/
[2023-07-20, 14:06:20] Aditya Sista 2010B5: I was thinking in the lines of how filecoin works, proof of space time, maybe we could have proof of space time compute. There were already some tokens that  are trying to solve this, but they haven't created a new protocol. But then it's entirely possible and likely that you're better off using web2 technologies to solve this
[2023-07-20, 14:15:45] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Will need to see proof of space time. I just know about proof of work
[2023-07-20, 14:24:46] Paras Chopra Wingify: It’ll be curious to see how they’ve defined data centers

Feed that into a model again as a prompt with an example and you have these kinds of use cases. We can’t expect the users of technology to be logically consistent with the principles using which the technology was developed. Once tech gains use as a tool meant got ordinary users they see it as an instrument and we don’t expect insight from end users on this kind of thing

[2023-07-23, 21:16:32] Kaushik S YC W23: Contrarian take - most of the content will be AI generated. It will entertain us more. 

Just like Reels/TikTok and social media consumption far exceeded movie or traditional media consumption long ago, AI content will eclipse human content soon. 

Today, algorithms recommend content to you to hook you to your phone. Tomorrow’s algorithms will generate content after learning about you. That content will one day be way better and way more addictive, and I don’t think we’re going to notice or discuss it. Just like we don’t discuss how much social media we consume.

[2023-07-23, 23:02:22] Kaushik S YC W23: My 2c is that AI or not doesn’t matter. All content is AI assisted to the extent that it is at least enhanced by Google and Facebook’s algorithms. 

But really filtering out quality content becomes more challenging or at least needs to be done at a much higher scale.
[2023-07-23, 23:04:33] ~ Anjineyulu: A degree of likeness should be great!!!
[2023-07-24, 00:02:44] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: In fact I don't doubt the ability of AI systems to become good entertainment value - we are after all building on top of data from human entertainment - books, movies, music, etc. What I worry about is the ability of humans to be creative independent of using technology. Perhaps even this is nothing to worry much about. The lack of occasional boredom however is something to worry about. For a lot of people boredom has disappeared from routine living due to the ubiquity of entertainment and content
[2023-07-24, 00:05:34] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Artificial scarcity on a platform can be a driver of value and differentiation. I don't know if human raters using this to rate AI generated content adds any value. The problem is that AI content creation is on a conveyor belt while human attention and experience, consumption are more organic.

[2023-07-24, 14:54:30] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Looks like they swapped out the Twitter logo for X.ai as Musk mentioned in a tweet. From what I can tell X.ai seems to be interested in a broad mandate for AI, perhaps this is Musk's next moonshot akin to what he tried with Tesla and Space X? And the Twitter lobotomy performed earlier this year was done in search of a strategy for doing this? Does anyone know what problem statements X is intended to tackle?
[2023-07-24, 14:55:55] Anubhav mishra Zupay: here are 9 takeaways from x.ai Twitter space launch yesterday, point 6 and 9 are important according to me. Had joined in last night.

1. The founding team of xAI comes from prestigious institutions like DeepMind, OpenAI, Google, and Tesla. This level of talent and experience should allow them to make meaningful progress in AGI research.

2. xAI aims to create an AI that is highly curious and truth-seeking. By focusing on minimizing the gap between believed truth and actual truth, they hope to develop an AGI that is beneficial to humanity. This approach centers on understanding the universe and humanity versus narrower goals like optimizing Mars exploration.

3. Current AI systems cannot properly answer many basic questions about the nature of the universe, physics, and existential topics. xAI believes we are lacking in fundamental AI capabilities by many orders of magnitude. Advancing AI reasoning and comprehension is critical.

4. While heavy computing power will be utilized initially, the need for brute computational force should decrease over time as the AI develops real understanding and does not rely solely on pattern recognition. Efficient learning will become increasingly important.

5. xAI is positioned as a competitor to other major AI labs like OpenAI. Competition between researchers should drive faster progress, while transparency about capabilities will be important.

6. For training data, xAI will leverage sources like social media posts and tweets that other groups have used. Eventually, the AI may need to generate its own content and learn from that as human-created data is limited.

7. Dangerous practices like training AI to lie or be politically correct will be avoided. The system will be allowed to state believed truths even if controversial, while monitoring for harm.

8. Some level of regulatory oversight will be necessary to ensure safety without excessively limiting progress. Ideal regulations will be agreed upon by most stakeholders and avoid lengthy delays.

9. Potential shortcomings were acknowledged, like upcoming voltage transformer and electricity shortages in the next 1-2 years that could impact the computing needs of advanced AI systems like xAI aims to develop.

[2023-07-24, 14:58:01] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Billionaires need media arm, this is really expensive one.

[2023-07-24, 14:58:46] Nirant K: Probably not that expensive. Keeps the Tesla sales going and share price afloat
[2023-07-24, 14:58:56] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Ha, the $54bn media arm! Intriguing prospect
[2023-07-24, 14:58:58] Nirant K: Twitter/X was funded by banks and friends anyway
[2023-07-24, 14:59:34] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: And they started Twitter blue to monetize and probably made money from ads and saved money from firing lots of people
[2023-07-24, 14:59:35] Nirant K: Musk probably put less than $20B of that $54B from his pocket
[2023-07-24, 15:00:00] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yeah, Tesla and SpaceX marketing and branding
[2023-07-24, 15:00:23] Anubhav mishra Zupay: They'll launch a bunch of tools through Twitter I mean xai guys
[2023-07-24, 15:00:31] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: But of course this is all about free speech 😜
[2023-07-24, 15:01:39] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Do we have any knowledge about x.ai beside that twitter space? Like what they are going to build first, or going to open source, etc?
[2023-07-24, 15:02:21] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: In a way the "let that sink in" gesture and the "free speech" pitch seem like a distant memory.
[2023-07-24, 15:02:40] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Btw if you look at their team, they have people who have expertise in building models for math. 

I think that's what they might do first is something like building a Gopher that deepmind built
[2023-07-24, 15:02:56] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: That is a good hypothesis.
[2023-07-24, 15:03:15] Nirant K: Prolly copy Llama2 but for something less useful
[2023-07-24, 15:03:25] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I would be disappointed if they became another deepmind honestly.
[2023-07-24, 15:03:33] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Just that after signing a petition to not do any agi development for 6 months, he bought a ton of gpus under the name of x.ai
[2023-07-24, 15:04:33] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: The moratorium was never going to work. then there are those who will sign the moratorium and then go back to building AI - like Demis Hassabis
[2023-07-24, 15:04:46] Anubhav mishra Zupay: They only want to or would look to compete deepmind, people say Gemini will be a killer something that might achieve a glimpse of AGI
[2023-07-24, 15:04:56] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Dennis is offended 😂
[2023-07-24, 15:05:43] Divya Tak: No it was only for musk fans to have some talking points about musk. It was a PR stunt
[2023-07-24, 15:06:11] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Remember that humanoid robot Tesla was building? They should probably focus on building RL models for robotics but I personally think that first attempt will be training something from bad Twitter data.
[2023-07-24, 15:06:21] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: When Gato came our and with Alpha Go, Zero, fold and so on people had high expectations but as with many other things Google becomes a startup graveyard for AI teams too perhaps
[2023-07-24, 15:06:52] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Lol they are building a model on dojo supercomputer
[2023-07-24, 15:07:12] Anubhav mishra Zupay: 😂 I think whatever you ask they'll say yes we're already doing it
[2023-07-24, 15:07:41] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Elon said that current Dojo chip is comparable to A100, i highly highly doubt that.
[2023-07-24, 15:07:43] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: From Anubhav's notes: This seems relevant "3. Current AI systems cannot properly answer many basic questions about the nature of the universe, physics, and existential topics. xAI believes we are lacking in fundamental AI capabilities by many orders of magnitude. Advancing AI reasoning and comprehension is critical."
[2023-07-24, 15:08:10] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: ChatGPT wrote that
[2023-07-24, 15:08:19] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Haha

[2023-07-24, 17:12:41] Amogh V: Part 2 really picks up in the second half. Part 3 puts the phrase “that escalated quickly” to shame

[2023-07-24, 17:25:14] Anubhav mishra Zupay: His companies have done some pioneering innovation, it's just that he's bad with his own PR
[2023-07-24, 17:25:32] Divya Tak: Tesla is the company with biggest recalls of cars in history
[2023-07-24, 17:25:40] Divya Tak: and they have not made that many cars
[2023-07-24, 17:25:42] Ambika Computational Mama: one person doesn't make a company

[2023-07-24, 17:27:29] Ambika Computational Mama: sorry i started  a fire - but i think there is a lot of validity in being critical about your heroes
[2023-07-24, 17:27:37] Divya Tak: its unethical to make poorly engineered products that can put people's life at risk
[2023-07-24, 17:27:53] Divya Tak: which is something that software industry in general needs to learn more of
[2023-07-24, 17:28:11] Divya Tak: move fast and break things doesn't work if you're making things other than software
[2023-07-24, 17:28:45] ~ Nijil Y: like corona vaccines...

[2023-07-24, 17:31:10] Ambika Computational Mama: Its ok - im assuming many with a musk inclination are under 30, so there is hope for you yet! while sure he has made large business strides it is important to allow yourself some space and time to see him critically. Particularly as a young generation of technologists!
[2023-07-24, 17:32:11] Ambika Computational Mama: You are entering an era that is very unlike the noughts and to hang all your hopes to a man with an extremely privileged and unexamined life is something even LLMs will tell you avoid
[2023-07-24, 17:32:13] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Neutrality

[2023-07-24, 17:36:02] Divya Tak: Musk added about 3 million per day of interest on twitter's costs, because of how he bought the company. He is not a smart businessman making great decisions.
[2023-07-24, 17:37:51] ~ Nijil Y: i dont think making money is an objective for him anymore. what will you do once you become the richest person on the planet (moneywise)
[2023-07-24, 17:46:46] Amogh V: 32, mechanical engineer. Have built electric vehicles with my own hands. Started and shut down companies. Never in my dreams did I imagine I would see a rocket go up and land back down on its own on a swaying platform in the turbulent sea. I will never understand how someone can look at that and not be awestruck or inspired or think "meh that's just evil exploitative capitalism". A whatsapp message cannot describe what an impossibly difficult engineering challenge this is. "Oh but the engineers did all the hard work" anyone who says this hasn't seen an engineering team tear itself apart without direction or discipline, two things that can only be driven from the top.
Bad business decisions now and then, sure. Especially with Twitter. But I am yet to see Bayer pharma levels of exploitation like knowingly giving HIV infected blood in transfusion based medicines. Or Nestle with baby formula and water in Africa. 
Chaotic good >>> Lawful evil

I feel there are a lot more people doing way better chaotic good and you are privileging one person over all others. I simply stated that he has a tendency to regurigate and co-opt things that were not original his! And i dont think I'm wrong in that.
[2023-07-24, 17:56:59] Ambika Computational Mama: My stance as someone who dislikes his personality is nothing to do with my larger opinions about the world of late capitalism that we live in.
[2023-07-24, 17:57:37] Ambika Computational Mama: So my urge is not to dismiss you but rather encourage to have more world views

[2023-07-24, 18:09:20] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yeah. I'm waiting for Meta to release VoiceBox, I have crazy project ideas in this line, that I can automate with LangFlix pipeline. ElevanLab is expensive, and I'm a very stingy operator.
[2023-07-24, 18:10:08] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Soundstorm will also be good
[2023-07-24, 18:10:11] Divya Tak: https://icecube.wisc.edu/ not exactly Gen AI but really cool ML stuff, using neutrinos to map out the galaxy, in a telescope in antarctica which uses the ultra clear millenia old ice as one part of the detector, and then using ML to separate neurtinos from the sun vs those from the milkyway
[2023-07-24, 18:10:35] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Isn't this old project?

[2023-07-24, 18:11:04] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Nuetrino research has been going on for decade, recently they confirmed existence.
[2023-07-24, 18:11:14] Amogh V: Without people on pedestals our museums would be empty, our culture derelict and capable people uninspired to act boldly such that one day, through virtue of their character and their actions, they may earn pedestals of their own. Without people on pedestals we would have no civilization at all.
[2023-07-24, 18:12:16] Divya Tak: yea neurtrinos exist, that part isn't the cool part, but more that we are able to see them and separate out the 99.9% that come from sun
[2023-07-24, 18:12:39] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Artist folks and their images 😒. We were fine with a spectrometer reading to find existence.

[2023-07-24, 21:16:46] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: Not exactly, I think after a time people do forget the people who made the invention and only remember the work.
Problem with putting people on the pedestal is always the halo effect. A large part of their personality gets mirrored by wishfuls who also want to be put on the pedestal instead of just thinking about the next innovation

If a claim surfaces that they used specific images for training their models, would their client companies be implicated too?

Could anyone guide me towards insightful pieces or discussions on this topic?
[2023-07-25, 10:21:38] Amul Twitter Friend: @917737887058 is this the appropriate group for this question - lemme know
[2023-07-25, 10:22:59] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Legality of training data used to train LLMs is a huge grey area.

Will take some time for regulators to catch up, 
and regulation will always lag the latest innovation
[2023-07-25, 10:24:31] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: One interesting pov is : if you don't disclose what you have trained on, like OpenAI, 
regulators can't come after you, unless some legal ruling forces you to disclose details of your training set
[2023-07-25, 10:24:49] Nirant K: Yes

Unless we see some games happening, we can't be sure that this won't bite back later, till then we can only work on building POCs & subject matter expertise
[2023-07-25, 10:29:42] Amul Twitter Friend: Related

How can we automate the QC process, ensuring we avoid generating images that are peculiar or incongruous to our users?

Assuming that, for now, it is difficult to reverse engineer the training data source from the inference weights- we are shipping. But, this in on-premise infra. Will be interesting to see what people are using to deal with sensitive data that finds its way through the OpenAI/similar API calls.

[2023-07-26, 14:05:44] Anshul Bhide Replit: Isn’t Palantir a glorified IT services company?
[2023-07-26, 14:10:28] Nirant K: No, it punches value above it's revenue class because of it's Govt relationships now. Similar to what McK does.
[2023-07-26, 14:12:40] Anshul Bhide Replit: But isn’t it still a services company? McK is also a services company.

I know they have a product (gotham or something) but I wonder how much of their revenue comes from straightforward product sales vs customizing that for govt
[2023-07-26, 14:22:29] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: They also supply and customise their products to banks, for fraud detection and to a bunch of metropolitan police departments enabling them to make sense of all of their data

[2023-07-26, 14:45:27] Sumod K Mohan: I think they are also trying to get into product space (see new forays:https://www.palantir.com/platforms/foundry/). But guessing it still will be large % services. If my memory serves me right they were trying to be product company from beginning. In terms of revenue from Govt, more like Booz Allen than McK.

[2023-07-26, 15:39:51] Pratyush Choudhury: Those enterprise contracts will be huge - so % of costs for customizing might still make up for strong SaaS-ish GMs
[2023-07-26, 15:40:20] Anshul Bhide Replit: Nope! They outsource their services part to implementation partners like TCS wipro etc
[2023-07-26, 15:40:47] Pratyush Choudhury: Yeah, a bulk of it but some of the implementation is also owned by them
[2023-07-26, 15:41:08] Anshul Bhide Replit: Which I’m guessing palantir can’t do given a lot of is govt related which these partners won’t have clearance
[2023-07-26, 15:41:30] Pratyush Choudhury: Same is the case w/ the hyperscalers who work w/ the govt
[2023-07-26, 15:41:35] Anshul Bhide Replit: Yep so my definition would be what % of revenue comes from product licensing vs services
[2023-07-26, 15:41:46] Anshul Bhide Replit: I meant US / western govts
[2023-07-26, 15:42:22] Pratyush Choudhury: Yeah, I was talking from that angle only
[2023-07-26, 16:58:24] ~ Kahran Singh: I had a client years ago who broke marketing tech companies into two categories : companies that sell to CMOs who use tech as a shiny thing but actually make the money from selling smart people
And companies that sell to CIO/CTOs that are actually building tech that the companies feel they couldn’t afford/understand/build/etc themselves. 
These fundamentally hire and attract different kinds of people — one is gloried services which is sales driven. The other is a product company which is more product / Eng driven.

[2023-07-27, 00:25:19] Akshat Khare: Hi,
I wish to discuss from an indian AI ecosystem point of view if the eu act was implemented for India, what would be the ramifications of it? 
Act: https://www.klgates.com/European-Parliament-Adopts-Negotiating-Mandate-on-European-Unions-Artificial-Intelligence-Act-Trilogues-Begin-6-26-2023
Huggingface's view: https://huggingface.co/blog/eu-ai-act-oss
I think it slips by the fact that people who would be using llms as blackbox and serving them would be liable or not. I would like to understand groups view on this. If real world testing would require some certifications like drones require type certification for many things, what would the ramifications be? I hope I am not asking a naive or repetitive question here. I have been asked this question by a decision maker panel from GOI. I would like to give them a informed reply. Thanks!!

[2023-07-31, 09:00:14] Vamshi: I think caution is a good thing here.

But conceptually crypto seems inevitably linked to anything autonomous and algorithmically intelligent.
[2023-07-31, 09:00:34] Vamshi: It’s a good idea to distrust anyone with global access
[2023-07-31, 09:01:57] Vamshi: But also not simultaneously not a good idea to dismiss the value of crypto in a machine mediated world.

The world is already trivially machine mediated, but I think the difference with a real AGI mediating is a difference in mind and not in degree.
[2023-07-31, 09:02:24] Vamshi: *difference in kind not mind 😄

[2023-07-31, 09:03:56] Vamshi: Get paid to be “aligned” to the AGI
[2023-07-31, 09:04:41] Vamshi: Obviously this can have both a utopian and dystopian and more rational in-between banal ending.
[2023-07-31, 09:05:02] Vamshi: Paid in crypto
[2023-07-31, 09:05:43] Vamshi: *also simultaneously not
[2023-07-31, 09:06:35] Vamshi: The scary endings should be reason to not dismiss it, and not the other way round
[2023-07-31, 09:07:35] Vamshi: Otherwise the meditation will look like this-
Large corporations align AGI => AGI aligns the masses to them
[2023-07-31, 09:08:03] Vamshi: Crypto will be the economic catalyst for that alignment
[2023-07-31, 09:08:28] Vamshi: But the same protocols can be used to not put large corporations at the centre of the alignment

[2023-08-01, 13:24:00] Amul Twitter Friend: Agree

it is probably an unproven area

but most of identity change is likely rooted in daily conversation we have in our head

messages percolate the subconscious and slowly shape the identity

having GPT4 has been a blessing because it has probably read 1000s of books on affirmations - and when I tell it to say those affirmations in the style of Morgan Freeman picking up ideas from Louise L Hay and similar authors

it is able to provide high quality experience of a friend/therapist

it is addicitve

[2023-08-01, 14:33:01] Amul Twitter Friend: I think

the right word for affirmations is:
Inception via words

plant an idea deep into the subconscious via repetition/NSDR/writing etc.

the idea changes your identity a little

the identity makes it more intuitive for you to have a certain behaviour

the behaviour starts as an instance of an action

the action becomes habit

[2023-08-01, 14:33:57] Paras Chopra Wingify: Is there research on these actually working?

But irrespective of whether these are placebos or not, if these help people, it’s a positive thing
[2023-08-01, 14:36:58] Amul Twitter Friend: I haven't read research on this

I just experiment on myself

with me as a sample, has worked in context of health related anxiety

right words put my body at ease 

now experimenting with uplifting my mental health

one thing is clear:
they feel good

not sure of effectiveness because no one's measuring me apart from me - and am very subjective there

I started reading them in 2003 - Louise L Hay was the author I guess

I hear her tapes also

[2023-08-01, 16:50:15] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: My hypothesis is that, on average, childrens' brains are more plastic and hence respond better to affirmations.

But I agree that varies from person to person and for some people, works really well
[2023-08-01, 16:51:14] Amul Twitter Friend: I think emphasis on *some*

I've seen rational people don't find it useful

irrational people can often find it very helpful - it's in the direction of self-deception
[2023-08-01, 16:53:08] Amul Twitter Friend: Kinda agree

kids believe in comforting narratives of angels etc.

as we grow up, rationality takes over so we are often not open to new ideas

there isn't much mystery or wonder left when we become more rational

Since science doesn’t have any theory of free will, and doesn’t even acknowledge the concept, all magic is possible in the chain from intent to manifestation.

[2023-08-02, 01:10:27] ~ Vasu 🥸: Yes. But in most of the studies, the sample population is usually too small.

And isn't the placebo effect itself a good example of this?

The placebo effect is very much a real psychological phenomenon, and one can relate it to affirmations.
[2023-08-02, 01:16:47] ~ Vasu 🥸: But affirmations can be tried to be explained with some rationale right?

Until a person acknowledges or associates some credibility to an idea, she/he would never think about pursuing it. And affirmations try to do exactly that. It tries to trick your brain to start believing in something. Once you become conditioned to believe in something, you'll eventually start putting efforts into it, which in turn might help you realise the affirmation.
[2023-08-02, 01:20:21] ~ Vasu 🥸: Hi! Former wysa engineer here.

I strongly believe in this. Something like CBT can be elegantly handled via LLMs.
With proper training it should work for a lot of other therapy tools as well.
[2023-08-02, 01:23:35] Divya Tak: And especially considering how few mental health practitioners are there who are qualified, a good model can improve the access to mental health support to so many more people

https://ai.meta.com/blog/audiocraft-musicgen-audiogen-encodec-generative-ai-audio/

only a matter of time ( 6 months or less ?) before specific artist tuned models become available :
a model which generates "Taylor swift"-esque or "Billy Eilish"-esque music.

Closer home, I bet most of us won't be able to distinguish between music generated by the human Ritviz & a model trained on Ritviz's body of work :)

What do people think ?

edit :
a techno-philosophical question : can such music generating models be used for generating music in the style of an artist, who is no longer alive ?
If a song, generated by a model trained on e.g. Lata Mangeshkar's style of singing, is released and becomes  popular - does Lata Mangeshkar's trust get a share of the royalties ?
Should  the devs who developed the model, get a share of the royalties ? ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-08-04, 18:05:07] Sumod K Mohan: Thought Experiment: What if code of many companies gets leaked. This is used to build alternate companies providing same SW functionality at much cheaper prices, using LLM to make enough code changes to make it not exact copies. Not too far of a stretch given, state actors, leak of code bases etc. 

Is that ok, ethically/ legally? What are the chinks in this line of reasoning (assuming company only has tech most)?
[2023-08-04, 18:06:38] Sidhant Dhar: The biggest chink is assuming that code is a moat for the largest tech companies. The page rank algorithm can be trivially implemented today and is public knowledge, but there is only one google

I just focus on problems, some people who are good with people focus on people.

Problems transform but remain the same in essence, for serving people. And people, well everything exists for them to maximize what they want primarily - more money, status/influence/reach (limited understanding of mine here).

If you want to minimise loss of opportunity, just ask which area you need to zoom into. Everything that you already do or wish to do can be done faster, cheaper and with less manpower now. With that assumption just dive in.

[2023-08-10, 18:31:48] Ankur Pandey: Beautiful. A cause (information overload, misinformation, bias) I deeply value so had a visceral feeling reading it.
Having said that - I suspect that the more business use of personal AI will be in bot to bot commerce etc.

[2023-08-12, 09:31:51] Karthik GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: loved this perspective: 

If AI ever allows us to understand ourselves truly, it will not be because these algorithms captured the mechanical essence of the human mind. It will be because they liberated us to forget about optimization and to instead focus on what truly makes us human: loving and being loved.

[2023-08-12, 11:32:28] ~ Anjineyulu: I would be glad to see diverse opinions on this!!!
[2023-08-12, 12:38:15] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: So, I tried the custom instruction shared here and online on some reasoning tasks that even GPT-4 with code interpreter was getting wrong.
ANd now its getting it right.
https://chat.openai.com/share/5979eb7e-9777-4ae0-a8b3-54a13d39938a
So, guess what, AI can reason now
[2023-08-12, 12:42:54] Swapan Rajdev haptik.ai: So while I agree with the point of starting simple and then leap frogging, one very basic assumption being made here is that there is a very solid evaluation framework already present.

You'll be surprised how many people don't have a framework of evaluation to determine if a model is working or not. 

Simple or complex models, without a good eval framework none of it will lead to results. 

So my opinion, focus on getting a good measurement framework in place, try it with a simple model and then leap frog to see exponential results
[2023-08-12, 12:45:17] Nirant K: Swapan sir, you're holding humanity to such high bar, there are people who can't measure intent classification accuracy for customer support chatbots 🙈
[2023-08-12, 12:48:16] Swapan Rajdev haptik.ai: Hahaha tell me about it and honestly we also struggled with it a lot in our initial days. So I see where people are coming from.
[2023-08-12, 12:50:17] Nirant K: I think this was wayy trickier in 2017-18 than in 2023
[2023-08-12, 12:50:50] Nirant K: And if you had multi-class, multi-label tags — lot of people didn't have the attention span to understand why the numbers didn't add to 100%
[2023-08-12, 12:51:33] Nirant K: That scarred me so much, I quit ML and went to data engineering after that 


I still filter clients for numeracy
[2023-08-12, 12:52:07] Swapan Rajdev haptik.ai: Lol yea, and honestly people still don't, I am part of enough conversations and the amount of time I spend educating customers on this is crazy.


That's why it's more an education game than a execution game.
[2023-08-12, 12:52:37] Swapan Rajdev haptik.ai: Everyone wants the technical details but lack the patience to really understand it.
[2023-08-12, 12:53:50] ~ Anjineyulu: Do you see the situation improving.This make our life harder
[2023-08-12, 12:53:57] Nirant K: There was a bit of misalignment on incentives at the role too — I was being paid to execute, while the game, as you mentioned was education.

Education was seen as "talking" and not shipping, which just made everyone unhappy
[2023-08-12, 12:54:55] ~ Anjineyulu: I feel @nirant you can educate the bussiness people with this community only
[2023-08-12, 12:55:27] Nirant K: In India? No.

Bright spots and exceptions which prove the norm will continue to exist, but do we see baseline shifts? That takes years and ZIRP meant we lost a decade
[2023-08-12, 12:55:37] Nirant K: You can't teach people against their will
[2023-08-12, 12:55:48] Nirant K: Well, you can. I don't want to xD 
[2023-08-12, 12:57:48] ~ Anjineyulu: But what makes me unhappy is that top level management folks were some of the best tech folks
[2023-08-12, 12:58:12] ~ Anjineyulu: Are their mouth zipped because of share holders?
[2023-08-12, 12:58:40] Swapan Rajdev haptik.ai: Yea good call here. 

Education is a lot of experimentation in itself. What metrics/frameworks are a easy to understand and also a proper reflection of accuracy. (no one in this country understands bleu score.)

And this takes a lot of thinking, experimenting and then talking.
[2023-08-12, 13:00:53] Nirant K: Huh? No? 

I am inclined to believe founders are human — flawed, smart, courageous — and even they can't escape the contours of society's incentive design

E.g. if you were running a PAT focussed IT Services company in 2019, you were considered bottom of the barrel. You'd find it hard to hire engineers, PMs even if you paid top dollar (competitive to say, Google/Amazon at the time) 

This is because talent and investors both chose growth over everything else
[2023-08-12, 13:02:02] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: may i ask what is PAT ?
[2023-08-12, 13:02:16] Nirant K: The problem with putting founders/investors on a pedestal is that we've refused to acknowledge our role in the errors made
[2023-08-12, 13:02:27] Nirant K: Profit After Tax
[2023-08-12, 13:03:29] ~ Anjineyulu: I understand it is not easy to change.But any strategies to make it atleast 1% better?
[2023-08-12, 13:04:10] Swapan Rajdev haptik.ai: Also all the funding happened on demos, very few companies converted into building large scale AI applications.

Things are changing now and making sure AI actually works in production is become a big part of customers and investors goals.
[2023-08-12, 13:04:28] Nirant K: For the talent? Leave India
[2023-08-12, 13:05:04] Nirant K: Demo driven dev wasn't bad enough, we had demo driven fund raises!
[2023-08-12, 13:05:26] Nirant K: For the founders? Don't sell to India
[2023-08-12, 13:05:49] ~ Anjineyulu: Got it🤪
[2023-08-12, 13:06:44] Swapan Rajdev haptik.ai: This is true, you start selling outside India and the questions you get asked are really the right ones. We learnt and grew a hell lot just by selling outside India.

[2023-08-13, 16:35:56] ~ Mihir Neversleeps Pathare: but then again, the way things are moving, we will likely be talking to an ai for information retrieval anyway. 

Latest episode of Foundation (AppleTV+) kind of deals with this. 
Where the memories of the ancestor emperor Cleon I have been perfectly preserved and the way to interact with them is to speak with the AI hologram construct. 🤷‍♀️
[2023-08-13, 16:44:07] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Following words of my favorite philosopher, Kendrick Lamar, “everyone grieves different.” everyone’s personal view should be respected unless they are harming others.
[2023-08-13, 17:26:05] Ciyunni: As the fields medalist Terrence Tao was saying .. that having upload all his papers ... he know at least someone to talk to .... all the time !!

imagine a (physics/consciousness) student wanting to talk to Einstein or Bohm ... or Bennett. 

more importantly, *perspective-based digital twins* can be important to overcome bias or groupthink or build (younger) schools of thought (like social constructionism).
[2023-08-13, 17:28:59] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Character ai but real people you can talk to. I guess you can do that on basic level with some smart prompt engineering using gpt4
[2023-08-13, 17:32:25] Ciyunni: Terrence doesn't find enough interesting people, with his varied interests in mathematics, to talk to !
[2023-08-13, 17:36:20] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: He may be an extreme example due to being top few % in the field.

I have been always actively recording my parents for a while now. Even planning to go ahead and have a documentaty style sit down with everyone to tell us their stories and recollections of me.

One of the most true and saddest thing I had ever went something like this : when a parent dies, a only first witness to some of your life stories dies with it too and there’s no one else to recollect it
[2023-08-14, 22:20:07] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yes, I'm planning the same. Going to record them and their stories, and probably myself too.
[2023-08-14, 22:21:00] Nirant K: That's the surest way to prove that all our parents went to the same "khaana khaaya", "Shaadi karlo" school
[2023-08-14, 22:21:19] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Every intellect in the world, doesn't matter how nationalist they are about their own country, wants America to prosper.

[2023-08-14, 22:48:51] Adithya L Bhat Hackathon: Indians moving abroad in hopes of better opportunities might face the same issues of opportunity that we face here . Example is the Cisco caste case . And IIT MERITOCRACY case
[2023-08-14, 22:49:00] Ciyunni: India doesn't have the "complex innovation system capacity" ... we are wanting to build an aircraft now (Tata systems) or chip design and manufacturing ... we can't design hypersonic aircraft which basic conceptual models were built 30years ago.
[2023-08-14, 22:49:26] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Unlike China, Indians here have India’s agency. We advocate India and not oppose it like every other refugee that Dont like their country back home. So there is a flow back and forth.
[2023-08-14, 22:50:11] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: Not sure about that it's just that we have a bunch of markets ripe for exploitation that the diaspora is well placed to exploit

[2023-08-14, 22:55:32] Nirant K: tl;dr: Look at number of Indians who apply for higher ed abroad, and how many return
[2023-08-14, 22:56:12] Nirant K: I was being nice, didn't want to call you naive but then you had to correct me
[2023-08-14, 22:56:42] Nirant K: And do a 20y longitudinal analysis, with rollings cohorts
[2023-08-14, 22:56:58] Nirant K: This is to see if there is water to the idea that people do come back
[2023-08-14, 22:57:05] Sachin Legaltech: Just a context - I finished my masters in 2018. Around 15% of my batchmates have returned back. Around 5% moved to Canada.
[2023-08-14, 22:57:33] Sachin Legaltech: Couple of people who returned moved back to US in 2 years
[2023-08-14, 22:57:33] Nirant K: And just for kicks, you can then plot this against the RBI's RRR and see if you can find an offset
[2023-08-14, 22:58:37] ~ Prajna Prayas: Two of my friends have "temporarily" shifted to the US and Canada via on-site postings of a large Oil and Gas company
[2023-08-14, 22:58:43] Nirant K: 1 out of 5 is unusually high, perhaps because of peak ZIRP
[2023-08-14, 22:58:45] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: How many due to H1B, Rich families or existing business, aging parent and how many are actual Mohan Bhargav?
[2023-08-14, 22:59:00] Nirant K: This is why rolling cohorts help
[2023-08-14, 22:59:24] Nirant K: I have come to see any evidence without some cohort as sus now
[2023-08-14, 22:59:54] Nirant K: RCT without cohorts? Sus

UBI wins without cohorts? Sus

8 hours of sleep is good for you — without cohorts? Sus
[2023-08-14, 23:00:09] Sachin Legaltech: It's small sample size..But around half came back cause of family reasons and half because of H1B
[2023-08-14, 23:00:30] Vamshi: Wow, I thought this spurt of philosophical activity was a Saturday thing

[2023-08-14, 23:00:52] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: 15th August Long weekend
[2023-08-14, 23:00:57] Nirant K: Aug 14 today
[2023-08-14, 23:01:34] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Dude, everyone knows what is long weekend in India now, I didn't know how to pronounce San Jose in 2006 when I came here. 🤣
[2023-08-14, 23:01:41] Nirant K: More important, these people are more likely better off because of being US returned — both career wise and financially because of that exposure
[2023-08-14, 23:01:44] Vamshi: Hahaha ok.
[2023-08-14, 23:02:16] Nirant K: That's okay — I still don't know what GGML is

[2023-08-14, 23:07:24] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I'm experiencing this and am surprised. The Badge is such a big thing for Indian firms and investors. US/IIT etc
[2023-08-14, 23:08:14] Nirant K: Not unique to Indian firms — everywhere outside of SF, even US, EU and Australia live this way
[2023-08-14, 23:08:24] Nirant K: Samsung has/had made up titles to separate Old and new IITians
[2023-08-14, 23:08:43] Sachin Legaltech: I doubt that...But if people are not willing to look at you for interview, you might not want to interview there dude.. Fuck them...Plus having this sorta discrimination might be indicator that they will fail

[2023-08-14, 23:13:37] Nirant K: Why would I even interview someone from IIT Jodhpur CS when I can hire someone from IIT M Mechanical for 15 LPA and wait for 6 months till they learn enough everything relevant? 
[2023-08-14, 23:13:47] Nirant K: Not to mention — undergrad programs don't teach shit
[2023-08-14, 23:14:07] Nirant K: So the JEE rank is a quasi-guarantee that the person can slog
[2023-08-14, 23:14:09] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I didn't know what IIT or JEE was until the last few months of HSC exam. 🤣
[2023-08-14, 23:14:14] Nirant K: And that guarantee is worth gold
[2023-08-14, 23:14:47] Nirant K: I wish my children have this privilege as well

[2023-08-14, 23:15:25] Sachin Legaltech: But now knowledge is democratised at least in our world. Anyone can finetune LLM and read all the details of transformer architecture and showcase their skills on github or twitter.
[2023-08-14, 23:15:34] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Surat was so backward in terms of these things, there was not a single store that would sell JEE books.
[2023-08-14, 23:16:20] Sachin Legaltech: By that time, IITs mostly won't be as valuable as they were in our childhood
[2023-08-14, 23:16:22] Nirant K: Relax bhai — in our main group of 1000 people, 7 people have finetuned and 3 of them are you, me and @917407651462. Only 100 or so had even tried Llama2 — despite having a free to try demo
[2023-08-14, 23:16:47] Nirant K: Yeah, we often bought books via phone orders in 2010-11 too
[2023-08-14, 23:17:01] Nirant K: It'd be even more valuable

[2023-08-14, 23:18:47] Sandesh Anand: Recruitment is largely an act of omission, not selection. If this is 2014 and if you are trying to be the next Amazon, you will want to hire people who understand that culture. I am not defending them, just trying to empathize. 
FWIW - The exact same thing happens with IITs/NITs too. I used to be mad at companies that did this until I sorta realized how recruitment works. Basically, the cost of filtering out good candidates is much lower than selecting a bad candidate. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-08-14, 23:22:32] Sandesh Anand: One last point: 
Smart companies who don't pay top $$ will try to find filters which the rich companies won't apply, but still gets you good candidates (like partnering with a college and building a lab and so on). 
In other words, I am saying Occam's razor is real. The explanation of why this happens is because its easier to execute and not something sinister :)

[2023-08-15, 08:48:15] C Chaitanya: A little late to the discussion. My only take on US empire is that if History has taught us anything, it's that empires fall. It's not a question of if, it's a question of when. But the thing is, great empires generally stick around for many centuries. So in that regard I think the US is good for now. But the other side of the coin is that everything is changing so fast that we never know what might happen next decade.
[2023-08-15, 08:55:09] C Chaitanya: Don't think it will change so soon. The simple fact is that there is no faster filter which can help startups get the best candidates. Take our example at Ozonetel. When we started, we did not have a single IIT, IIM grad. In fact, most of the early team was picked up from the students I had taught. All of them had less than 60% in their college. So they did not qualify for campus placements. But I knew they did programming well. And in the early days I had time to spend on each candidate,talk to them and understand them.
Now when we are growing, unfortunately I don't have the time. So hiring is delegated to the managers. And they don't hire like me. So the shortcut is to go with the degree. Start with IIT, IIIT and then top 5 colleges in Hyderabad and other cities.
But it's still a shortcut. Sometimes we will stumble on the thorns in the shortcut. But we don't know a better faster way.
Sometimes I think I should go back to teaching and get some more students:)

Here are some of the challenges:
1. Processes keep changing frequently so how do we understand and exclude picking up chats which refer to previous process.
2. How do we measure correctness of a response , bot satisfaction may not be the right proxy as the user can be happy with the resolution but the response may be inherently wrong.
3. Monitoring or alerting frameworks where content is not present.
4. Identify areas where it doesn't have visibility and redirect to a human if confidence score is lower than say 30 percent

"Faith and Fate: Limits of Transformers on Compositionality" says:
"Our empirical findings suggest that Transformers
solve compositional tasks by reducing multi-step compositional reasoning into
linearized subgraph matching, without necessarily developing systematic problem solving skills"

No Blade Runner 2049 then. Disappointed
[2023-08-16, 15:08:30] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This is highly relevant to me. One approach to measuring correctness of a response is through human validation but it is time consuming and variability is high. What is a bit more scalable is using one of the semantic similarity models to compute similarity in responses. Content monitoring is probably a logging feature. FAQs need to be curated and updated. I also think there is a case for anomaly detection - helps us measure if the knowledge base is relevant or needs to be updated.

[2023-08-16, 16:12:01] Prashant Nolano: I remember a paper where you can get very high multiplication accuracy by fine-tuning to predict the reverse of the answer. 

For ex: 15*15= 225. So instead of predicting 225, fine-tune it to predict 552.
Note that multiplication in a way uses the output from the last digit, and auto regressive models can't look ahead.

[2023-08-17, 20:39:43] Nirant K: Hello Folks, I have a question regarding evaluation for text generation model. I am currently using Flan-T5 base. Facing issue on how can I justify my output. There are some cases where we have our prediction contextually right but not exact to the targets. We need to define our business metric.

Examples -:
Pred:  In the event any payment of Rent or any other charge or monetary obligation is not received by Landlord within five (5) days after the due date thereof, Tenant shall pay as additional Rent, a late charge in the amount of five percent (5%) of the outstanding delinquent balance.

Target:  The Tenant shall pay a late charge of an amount equal to 5% of the overdue amount.
Rouge :  {'rouge1': 0.36363636363636365, 'rouge2': 0.1875, 'rougeL': 0.33333333333333337, 'rougeLsum': 0.33333333333333337}
[2023-08-17, 20:40:22] Nirant K: Asking this on philosophy — that message is the context, why does business folks want to be treated like smart people when it comes to making decisions and toddlers when it comes to metrics?

[2023-08-17, 20:54:24] Nirant K: I am blessed to have clients who don't ask me such questions out of sheer embarrassment and fear of higher invoices
[2023-08-17, 21:02:08] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Its more to do with how anyones mental models for metrics have developed and where is the muscle used. 

Its far easier to map metrics to things which are very directly transferrable from finance/operations since those are most heavily staffed.

When it comes to new things which dont have a prior, it has far more ambiguity. The skill isnt about business folks or non-business folks, its about how much ambiguity can someone reduce to metrics to reduce the ambiguity.
[2023-08-17, 22:10:24] Nirant K: Completely fair, let me rephrase my question then — since this is about exposure (priors?), what can we do to increase the speed at which priors evolve?

E.g. increase the chances that they Google, familiarise via IG reels?

[2023-08-18, 10:17:34] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: Gartner Hype Cycle places generative AI on the ‘Peak of Inflated Expectations’

*Extract*
There is, however, plenty of confusion in the market, with vendors claiming enormous productivity numbers. “A lot of our users, if they’re seeing some benefits, it’s nowhere close to what the vendors are claiming at this point in time.”

That, combined with challenges around de-risking and deploying generative AI models to make sure it is not hallucinating in customer-facing use cases, “is why I think it’s the right place for generative AI: on the Peak of Inflated Expectations.”

[2023-08-18, 10:19:57] Divya Tak: When people realise that there are still so many kinks to remove before it can replace knowledge workers fully. Or eliminate parts of our own workflows. It needs a lot of hand holding.
[2023-08-18, 11:53:41] Ankur Pandey: I think we're still before the peak. The really peak will happen during 24, late 24 when economy recovers so funding swells and every major country has AI policy and we have a few Adam Neumann & Elizabeth Holmes of GenAI.

Company has a history of making good bets
[2023-08-19, 10:58:17] Shashwat TDC: Looks very sad, discouraging and hopeless. We were in this phase for good last 1-2 months. Interestingly, a competition marketing campaign, brought a ray of enlightenment.

Few good frameworks in the trough of disillusionment cud be :
1. do less, think/simulate more (remember everyone is trying)
2. Save your energy by quick ans short discussions within the team (imp: lengthier discussion might do exactly opposite when there is lack of clarity)
[2023-08-19, 11:00:58] Shashwat TDC: Starts a downward spiral of "what am I doing". 

To answer what can be fully automated, we need to identify "what is the work that is getting done". 

Lastly as Karpathy says, "somethings are easier to dream but harder to build like self driving cars". I think autonomous agents also fall in same category
[2023-08-19, 11:05:52] Nirant K: Autonomous agents are not easy to dream if you've ever drawn a state machine diagram with more than 7 nodes
[2023-08-19, 11:08:14] Shashwat TDC: YKWIM. It is easy to dream. All LLM-apps at some stage want to fully automate a given workflow.

[2023-08-23, 23:22:40] Vamshi: https://phys.org/news/2023-08-brain-patients-scientists-reconstruct-pink.amp
[2023-08-23, 23:23:04] Vamshi: "Music is universal. It probably existed in cultures before language," Knight said. "We'd like to fuse that musical extraction signal with the word extraction signal, to make a more human interface."
[2023-08-23, 23:25:28] Vamshi: It’s always intrigued me that in the early days, neural network based solutions were referred to as “sub-symbolic” computation, along with the more topologically based description, “connectionist”.
[2023-08-23, 23:27:06] Vamshi: The idea of expanding language beyond the world of symbols is just around the corner from using language as a user interface and index, into a knowledge representation that’s essentially sub-symbolic.
[2023-08-23, 23:34:01] Vamshi: It’s going to be super interesting once models created with EEG data learn to impedance match their current representations to be more interaction friendly with the human brain.

[2023-08-24, 08:54:45] Sreejith Puthanpurayil: IIUC, Chomsky doesn't deny that the day of intelligent machines will come but that the approach taken by LLMs are fundamentally different (& implicitly that we might hit roadblocks). My understanding of Chomsky's position is that humans work with richer internal structures (based on consistency/causality) and language is just a tool of thought/expression and a less richer representation. One critique against Chomsky's position I've heard is that LLMs themselves could be building rich internal representations.
[2023-08-24, 09:18:36] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: IMHO, sometimes, i feel, people who criticise  ai, llms , please criticise to you heart's content,

[2023-08-24, 14:51:47] Nirant K: More Indians can "read" English numbers now than ever because phone numbers use English numbers.

[2023-08-24, 14:55:17] Nirant K: It's easy to fool ourselves into thinking that we're not making progress because of cheaper Internet — because we can't measure 2nd order consequences directly, like you would say with schools or colleges.

[2023-08-27, 16:38:36] Vamshi: TL;DR summary :
[2023-08-27, 16:39:05] Vamshi: Reflections. Let’s summarize what we’ve learned as a 2022 time traveler examining state of the art 1989 deep learning tech:

First of all, not much has changed in 33 years on the macro level. We’re still setting up differentiable neural net architectures made of layers of neurons and optimizing them end-to-end with backpropagation and stochastic gradient descent. Everything reads remarkably familiar, except it is smaller.
The dataset is a baby by today’s standards: The training set is just 7291 16x16 greyscale images. Today’s vision datasets typically contain a few hundred million high-resolution color images from the web (e.g. Google has JFT-300M, OpenAI CLIP was trained on a 400M), but grow to as large as a small few billion. This is approx. ~1000X pixel information per image (384*384*3/(16*16)) times 100,000X the number of images (1e9/1e4), for a rough 100,000,000X more pixel data at the input.
The neural net is also a baby: This 1989 net has approx. 9760 params, 64K MACs, and 1K activations. Modern (vision) neural nets are on the scale of small few billion parameters (1,000,000X) and O(~1e12) MACs (~10,000,000X). Natural language models can reach into trillions of parameters.
A state of the art classifier that took 3 days to train on a workstation now trains in 90 seconds on my fanless laptop (3,000X naive speedup), and further ~100X gains are very likely possible by switching to full-batch optimization and utilizing a GPU.
I was, in fact, able to tune the model, augmentation, loss function, and the optimization based on modern R&D innovations to cut down the error rate by 60%, while keeping the dataset and the test-time latency of the model unchanged.
Modest gains were attainable just by scaling up the dataset alone.
Further significant gains would likely have to come from a larger model, which would require more compute, and additional R&D to help stabilize the training at increasing scales. In particular, if I was transported to 1989, I would have ultimately become upper-bounded in my ability to further improve the system without a bigger computer.

[2023-08-28, 02:14:49] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Point taken.
But lets not equate a million dollar drone which has capabilities to evade radar and missile batteries to a DJI mod.

What is without dispute is that drones are the future of warfare- ranging from kamikazi drones to sophisticated multi million $ which can engage in dogfights and sense and make autonomous decisions.
An air force, like India, which faces a range of threats on the Pakistan-to-China spectrum, maybe we need a mix of multiple drones, of varying complexity-price tradeoffs !

[2023-08-28, 16:21:21] Saurabh Karn Nyai: I was speaking to some scientists a few days back and this is what they said. 
1) you will need it to become a national focus. This will be a decade long game as you want to get in ballpark of few nano meter fabrications. That’s millions and millions of dollars just in R&D. Which again would mean you will need a lot of talent to stay in India. 

2) Supplychain - you will need to source raw materials, silicon to create wafers. And then you will have to do computational lithography. So when you design a chip at that small fabrication the electronics turns into physics problems. NVIDA sometime back demoed how they are using AI to optimise for it. What you design is not what you etch on the wafers. 

3) as Nirant said, you need crazy ass conglomerates willing to go from “dhandha” mindset to taking billion dollar bets for all of this to even see 5-6 years of day light

[2023-08-28, 16:26:07] Anubhav mishra Zupay: There is only one thing, if jio has to be a big player they need to do it. Especially if we are comparing them to be a tencent or a Baidu of India.
[2023-08-28, 16:31:04] Saurabh Karn Nyai: My belief is that ROI will be there. It will not be there in short term for sure.
[2023-08-28, 16:37:16] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Jio has been traditionally a dhandha company. I personally don’t have much hopes from them. But I would be super happy if they did it!
[2023-08-28, 16:38:23] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: but they have acquired companies like haptik etc. Not sure if it is for dhanda purposes only. But yes , I'm also sceptical
[2023-08-28, 16:38:37] ~ Prajna Prayas: They will just buy Ai4Bharat or other similar companies. They have the most important moat anyone can have: Cash in the bank
[2023-08-28, 16:39:31] Anubhav mishra Zupay: I don't think so 
They had a jio AI institute they roped in some good experts in 2019
[2023-08-28, 16:39:54] Anubhav mishra Zupay: AlAI4Bharat will take more time to build than jio
[2023-08-28, 16:40:30] Anubhav mishra Zupay: I won't be surprised if they already have GPUs already by now
[2023-08-28, 16:42:40] Anubhav mishra Zupay: My question remains the same what does an India specific AI / LLM mean ?
[2023-08-28, 16:44:27] ~ Prajna Prayas: No idea, but as far as I can contemplate, they have no idea as well.
[2023-08-28, 16:50:11] Gokul Krishnan: You mean to setup fabs as well as packaging and shipping?
[2023-08-28, 16:56:02] Kunal Bhatia Hexo: Isn't having a GPU farm the best dhandha in the AI space?
[2023-08-28, 17:00:36] Nirant K: Second best
[2023-08-28, 17:00:59] Nirant K: The best is to have a user/buyer for whatever the heck you build with AI i.e. the MSFT/GOOG/AMZN position ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-08-28, 19:36:40] Nirant K: Tata already plans in motion for chip supply lines around prefabs via Tata Electronics (Tata Semiconductors) — if there is someone who can pull off that "ecosystem" play, that's Tata. It has the firmware engineering talent via Tata Elxsi, hardware relationships via years of doing Tata Telecom, and buyers via a mix of these two.

[2023-08-28, 20:18:04] Saurabh Karn Nyai: It’s a good question. For specific domains I still do see a value but a general LLM would mean very different kind and quality of text. Maybe training them on vedas and traditional Indian knowledge systems would allow LLMs to show us the path to salvation!

[2023-08-30, 16:40:06] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: True
[2023-08-30, 16:40:16] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I was wondering Meta has a huge conversation data from FB and Insta, are they using it to train LlaMa? I am sure the data curation job will be PiA  but sure they can create the best conversation LLM if they decide to. wdyt?
[2023-08-30, 16:40:22] Nirant K: I suspect Zurg doesn't want to invest too much into taking on OpenAI, partially because he knows that the true enemy is TikTok and Amazon
[2023-08-30, 16:40:32] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Bringing the crazy town talk to philosophy.
[2023-08-30, 16:41:58] Nirant K: I don't think it's worth the reputation+legal risk for them
[2023-08-30, 16:42:18] Nirant K: Plus, real risk of lot of sexting leaking into that LLM
[2023-08-30, 16:42:30] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: So Zuck's endgame is control our the "Communication and Social" domain, and he can release new version of LlaMas to keep others big tech at bay.
[2023-08-30, 16:42:47] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: He did with Networking industry and released many open platforms
[2023-08-30, 16:42:59] Nirant K: Not Comms & Social, but where and how we make buying choices
[2023-08-30, 16:43:38] ~ YP: They can use their inhouse llama to drive reccomendations? That's true about personal details leaking

How do large labs filter billions of tokens of text data?

I work in an image gen company and filtering data is quite a nice technical challenge for us
[2023-08-30, 16:43:55] Anubhav mishra Zupay: But I definitely think if anyone were to make a super intelligent conversational AI that is a personal assistant odds are with Mera only
[2023-08-30, 16:44:20] Nirant K: Nope, Salesforce and MSFT have more business, clean convo data than you might think
[2023-08-30, 16:44:30] Nirant K: And they're licensed to use it — already ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-08-30, 16:45:27] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: If we are going to build AGI based on LinkedIn and Salesforce, damn, it is going to cringe as hell
[2023-08-30, 16:45:31] Anubhav mishra Zupay: But don't you think it has associated bias , the data they have ?
[2023-08-30, 16:45:55] Nirant K: You call it bias, I call it "ready for commercial use"
[2023-08-30, 16:47:15] Nirant K: And I've seen about 3-4 of these "cleaning" data cycles to have conviction that clean data + talent wins — assuming compute and alg is roughly similar/same
[2023-08-30, 16:47:16] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Hmm, but on a different note, don't you think meta will definitely be interested in making super intuitive convo AI products ?
[2023-08-30, 16:47:24] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Tell you my thesis, every business outside of foundation model companies and GPU seller/buyers in GenAI is going to be rooted on data curation. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-08-30, 16:47:56] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Agreed!
[2023-08-30, 16:48:31] Nirant K: Nope, Meta knows that there is very little money in text
[2023-08-30, 16:48:40] Nirant K: Most money going forward is in video and images
[2023-08-30, 16:49:41] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Orca already proved that. All that matters is high-quality data first, then  domain-specific high quality data, then domain-specific high-quality graphs to enable reasoning. LLMs are just stochastic parrots on your data.
[2023-08-30, 16:50:18] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Money is where retention at all cost is , I am talking from the point of a consumer on mera platforms, what according to you is going to be the defining product in the consumer AI ( overall)
[2023-08-30, 16:51:18] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Recently had conversation with @918197266977, we still don't have technique (something in ball park of semantic search) that can fetch complete graphs based on query to fed into LLM for decision making. Someone interested in AI research can take a dig at it. I'm done with research and papers.
[2023-08-30, 16:52:12] Anubhav mishra Zupay: @19377081307 do you think it is slightly possible that the way in which Deepmind might be building Gemini which speculatively better than gpt4 would ideally follow or be an LLM ? Or due think it's gonna be something way different
[2023-08-30, 16:52:37] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Something that serves dopamine considering hedonic needs of a consumer.
[2023-08-30, 16:53:00] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: 🤷‍♂️
[2023-08-30, 16:53:12] Anubhav mishra Zupay: 😂
[2023-08-30, 16:54:20] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I be honest, I see Google as IBM when Woz was hacking PC boards in garage. They have everything, but not the vibe.
[2023-08-30, 16:55:05] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Maybe maybe not
[2023-08-30, 16:55:59] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Vibes > Movement > Culture > New Era, pipeline has never failed.
[2023-08-30, 16:56:44] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Yeah
[2023-08-30, 16:58:36] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Zuck is riding the vibe of tech ecosystem, that's the probably best answer for the question why Meta is open sources LlaMa. They never planned that first LlaMa weights will be leaked and create a movement. Now they just took the flag from Huggingface for that.
[2023-08-30, 16:59:31] Anubhav mishra Zupay: I think there is a huge possibility that either IBM or Mera will acquire huggingface
[2023-08-30, 16:59:41] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: They had 25K A100 cluster at start of the year, mostly eating dust, reason Carmack left Meta. So now they are using properly.
[2023-08-30, 17:05:19] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Yeah. I think the technical problem is the gap between symbolic AI and ML. I am attending Neuro Symbolic summer school and authors were saying something similar. 

I think graphs will start becoming useful when we are building conditional flows for more precise and explainable decision making. You can use graph to constraint the problem to reduce the potential search space etc. 

I feel like LLMs might be the way to scale experts systems which were explainable but we’re not suited to make changes and never had high quality benchmark data. That’s what I am getting directionally.
[2023-08-30, 17:06:27] Saurabh Karn Nyai: So with respect to graph we could either have prediction tasks using graph ml, node prediction, relationship prediction tasks and through neuro symbolic explain ability seems to be where it’s all going g.
[2023-08-30, 17:11:37] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Kind of knowledge graph embeddings, but I don't have experience with it have an educated conversation.
[2023-08-30, 17:11:44] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: May be @917737887058 knows
[2023-08-30, 17:29:20] ~ vignesh iyer: Instead.. HF might as well go the enterprise route .. at least going by their Series D investor profiles
[2023-08-30, 18:15:11] Gokul Krishnan: Would be a massive security / PR issue if someone can get the model to generate text between private individuals
[2023-08-30, 18:15:37] Gokul Krishnan: If all this OSS thing is Zuck trying to rebrand fb, this doesn't help at all
[2023-08-30, 18:21:34] ~ vignesh iyer: True.. they claim it's all encrypted.. with no visibility to them.. so training these texts into models will turn out to be against their claims.. and yes, huge PR issue
[2023-08-30, 18:22:08] Gokul Krishnan: WhatsApp's E2E encrypted. Idk about Instagram and messenger convos
[2023-08-30, 18:23:44] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Is it possible that the number of token combined on meta platforms is greater than what openAI used from open web ? ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-08-30, 18:30:12] Vamshi: If they finally automate catching up with social media posts, we can all just log off social media and let the bots have a field day
[2023-08-30, 18:30:51] Vamshi: They’ll have to come up with something else to fill the void though
[2023-08-30, 18:30:52] Gokul Krishnan: Still where the uncles and aunties vibe

[2023-08-30, 18:34:17] Vamshi: Zuck always had the best intentions
[2023-08-30, 18:34:49] Vamshi: Facebook should come up with a new mission statement
[2023-08-30, 18:34:54] Vamshi: “Love is all you need”
[2023-08-30, 18:35:06] Vamshi: Sorry Meta

[2023-08-31, 02:49:50] Nirant K: I've burnt my hands enough to now look at all these KG and Symbolic AI "dreams" as exactly that
[2023-08-31, 02:51:40] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: 😂 The dream keeps coming back every few years here and there with some new hope.
[2023-08-31, 02:52:34] Nirant K: I suspect this is because people don't believe in Sutton or like "control"
[2023-08-31, 02:53:05] Nirant K: Control and Intelligence are orthogonal objectives — in humans and systems alike
[2023-08-31, 02:56:34] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Intelligence is also knowing more control equations, permutations and bounds. Creativity, you can say is orthogonal to control, intelligence I believe is just a higher-level abstraction.
[2023-08-31, 02:57:36] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: By the way, metaphorically and not PID ones. 😂
[2023-08-31, 02:58:15] Nirant K: This is the talent vs genius argument. I refuse to believe creativity/genius is innate.
[2023-08-31, 02:58:56] Nirant K: Above a certain level of persistence and madness — not much else matters. This is why being a little insane is a competitive advantage in so many lines of work
[2023-08-31, 03:01:56] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: We want our superintelligent to be insane and regular one to be controlled.

[2023-08-31, 10:00:39] Nirant K: I have 5 DMs a week on Twitter about folks from a mix of those shady diplomas and these ugrad in AI programs, please don't do them. Take a drop year and go to a good college.
[2023-08-31, 10:03:29] Shashwat TDC: If you are studying. Wud recommend to go for the AI course and then learn from Yt and WhatsApp communities. Almost all practical knowledge is learnt that way. Keep the degree for the parents and family.
[2023-08-31, 10:03:58] Nirant K: No, please don't learn from YT or WA
[2023-08-31, 10:04:44] Nirant K: Pedigree is extremely useful — it's better to do Chemical Engineering from IIT KGP than CS from T2 Univ
[2023-08-31, 10:04:46] Shashwat TDC: Sure, that's my personal opinion. Heavy user of curated feeds - WhatsApp, discover, twitter lists and YT
[2023-08-31, 10:06:20] Nirant K: User vs What opens doors for you is quite different — once I've pedigree, I can use the best way to learn, because the doors that matter to me are open to me anyway
[2023-08-31, 10:07:08] Nirant K: Pedigree is an elimination criteria, skill is a selection criteria — and it's useful to separate the two mentally when answering questions from those with less context than us ‎<This message was edited>

For the relatives children who think i am in a better position to suggest courses for them. Sadly most people don't realise the power of self learning until they are out of name sake college, rubber meeting the road. Be it 1900s or 2000s , the one with motivation will find a way to learn.  Knowledge can be served and not fed. Just that it's access is more democratised. I am done with academics and been in industry for a decade and working on my own idea now.

[2023-08-31, 11:17:22] ~ Chinmay Talegaonkar: I think pedigree just makes it easier to open doors. It’s not a substitute to skills. The platforms you mentioned are great ways to learn skills. But in early career, the opportunities available to a person with pedigree and skill level x, will statistically be more than person without pedigree and skill x.
[2023-08-31, 11:18:19] ~ Chinmay Talegaonkar: Assuming one wants to stay in tech most of your career, upskilling is going to be a life long process. A degree (undegrad) is 4 years or lesser.
[2023-08-31, 11:59:18] Shashwat TDC: I think I missed mentioning online courses. For today's students PW/ Coursera etc is already very helpful but learning ime is largely self paced and online.

It's AI today, data science a few years back. You can talk to some of those graduates for their experiences.

A big part of Indian undergrad education is pedigree and peer group. Both of which is questionably at T2 unis. 

Yes, if you're sufficiently motivated, you can study from YouTube and WhatsApp but it's exponentially difficult when your environment doesn't encourage/force you to do it. We're talking about 16 year old kids here!

[2023-09-02, 19:38:01] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: thanks for sharing !

these 2 paragraphs really struck a chord :

"“I think that what we haven’t really come to grips with is the impact of … family. Because no matter how rich or poor you are, or which ethnic background you come from, or what your gender is, a kind and supportive family is a huge turbo charge,” he says. “And I think we’re at a moment with the development of AI where we have ways to provide support, encouragement, affirmation, coaching and advice. We’ve basically taken emotional intelligence and distilled it. And I think that is going to unlock the creativity of millions and millions of people for whom that wasn’t available.”"


Now 39, he’s still not in touch with his dad, and lives alone in California. Reflecting on what he hopes AI can offer – “a boost to what you can do, the way that you feel about yourself” – he says: “I certainly didn’t have that. And I think that many don’t.” But is interaction with a chatbot a realistic replacement for companionship, support, even love? It’s hard not to find the idea a bit chilling. “It’s not intended to be a substitute. But that doesn’t mean it’s useless. I think it can fill in the gaps where people are lacking. It’s going to be a tool for helping people get stuff done. Right? It’s going to be very practical.”

personally, i dont feel i would ever imagine talking to a virtual assistant for emotional connection

[2023-09-03, 14:49:13] Micheil: I read this too and initially filed it under the header: another person who was once at the helm of developing AI and is now probably going to capitalise from the fear of AI. But maybe there’s more to it?
[2023-09-03, 17:07:25] Ciyunni: Easier said than done.

My 2cents- 

The approaches don't have enough guardrails. 

"Doing something for everybody never works." Doing something bespoke which works for a certain customer segment could be useful. 

There's a cultural assumption and a technological hegemon that plays into ... creating mental health apps. The ones which are most *responsible*; evidence-based are also the narrowly (customer segment) focused Apps. 

Silver bullet, panacea for all, will take us down obsessive pathways.
[2023-09-03, 17:36:00] Vamshi: I liked 3D engines, generative art and simulation games, but feel totally disconnected from other types of games, which have goals etc.

I’m yet to feel connected to the current flow of chat bots, but I suspect they will feel very unlike regular games, as things move along.

There’s something about bots inheriting the collective knowledge of the internet that makes them interesting in the same way a visit to the library (remember those?) used to be.
[2023-09-03, 17:37:23] Vamshi: It’s like the library turned into a talking librarian who kinda digested everything in the library.

Thoughts? Who would be in your top 100 in AI?
[2023-09-08, 07:57:37] Nirant K: Any list which puts Timnit and Sam Altman at the same skill _category_ and _level_ is to be laughed at
[2023-09-08, 07:58:33] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: And no Karpathy
[2023-09-08, 07:58:44] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Good to see Karya and wadhwani from india
[2023-09-08, 08:00:15] Anubhav mishra Zupay: And it's only gen AI 

No one from cruise or any of those autonomous EVs or others
[2023-09-08, 08:03:29] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: They have Palantir and Boston dynamics
[2023-09-08, 08:05:25] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Ohh yeah, they should have included cruise guys too
[2023-09-08, 08:06:41] Nirant K: Good for them, bad idea to mix Gods among the mortals. What next? You'll say Goodfellow is missing too? ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-09-08, 16:06:46] Anubhav mishra Zupay: @19377081307 lol we discussed this on the group
[2023-09-08, 16:06:54] Nirant K: Now, Jio can pull this off
[2023-09-08, 16:07:12] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Do they have data centers already ?
[2023-09-08, 16:07:26] Nirant K: Yes, Jio has a Cloud
[2023-09-08, 16:08:17] Nirant K: https://www.jiocloud.com/
[2023-09-08, 16:09:23] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Mukesh Kaka is going to directly compete with Gurninji and Ai4Bharat.  Finally, the ecosystem will win, even though I have doubts about feasibility and usability of a model trained for native languages.
[2023-09-08, 16:09:56] Kesava Reddy: That's Azure based, they pay the bomb to Ms
[2023-09-08, 16:11:05] Nirant K: Reliance can sell to Indian Army, which most younger players can't. 
[2023-09-08, 16:11:15] Nirant K: and GoI is a captive customer for RIL
[2023-09-08, 16:11:30] Kesava Reddy: Agree
[2023-09-08, 16:11:45] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Public sector is huge
[2023-09-08, 16:11:46] Nirant K: Roughly 30% of India's GDP is Govt expense, I do not underestimate Reliance's cunning
[2023-09-08, 16:13:29] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: They will have to acquire talent pool though. For AI and Infra.
[2023-09-08, 16:13:29] Kesava Reddy: I think Jensen met Jio folks on Tuesday.
[2023-09-08, 16:13:40] Anubhav mishra Zupay: No I think the government will use reliance infra to build for DPI they might create something like NPCI. 

BHAI
[2023-09-08, 16:13:48] Nirant K: Infra talent, they've.
[2023-09-08, 16:14:14] Nirant K: GoI can make it mandatory to use Jio, like they've done it with Telecom
[2023-09-08, 16:14:36] Nirant K: It's easier to force businesses than individuals
[2023-09-08, 16:14:49] Anubhav mishra Zupay: 😂 please , I don't think they want to do it.
[2023-09-08, 16:15:21] Nirant K: I don't think GoI can go against their Prime Minister, Mukesh Ambani
[2023-09-08, 16:15:29] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Bringing down inference cost to MS+OAI level is going to need some good amount of innovation.
[2023-09-08, 16:15:39] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Well Jio-political implications
[2023-09-08, 16:15:43] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: yea jio threw insane money to hire the folks for jiocinema scaling.
[2023-09-08, 16:15:46] Nirant K: They don't need to!
[2023-09-08, 16:15:48] Kesava Reddy: I doubt it, but knowing them they will acquire it very fast ...
[2023-09-08, 16:16:53] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: And most of jiomart tech was built by koreans they outsourced the tech.
[2023-09-08, 16:17:04] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I won't doubt a determined Gujju with super deep pockets.
[2023-09-08, 16:18:01] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: If Reliance is jumping on the AI boat, we found PMF for the industry.
[2023-09-08, 16:18:07] Nirant K: Jio's Telecom, their most famous 4G/5G pieces are also Korean and American
[2023-09-08, 16:18:10] Kesava Reddy: Jio Cinema  scaling ..  there is more to than infra
[2023-09-08, 16:18:41] Nirant K: Time to rebrand myself to AI Engineer from ML Engineer 🤣
[2023-09-08, 16:18:49] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: PMF for an industry ideally is at least 3 ppl fighting, here its a losing battle for most :(
[2023-09-08, 16:18:56] Kesava Reddy: Deep pocketed Gujju is deadliest
[2023-09-08, 16:19:13] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: yea but everything is hirable by throwing money is the point.
[2023-09-08, 16:19:22] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: I think that will get them lot of userbase + massive revenues (AVOD streaming)
[2023-09-08, 16:21:08] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Many people are fighting but others are just too small to be seen
[2023-09-08, 16:21:45] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: kab hoga tencent vs bytedance iss desh mein :P
[2023-09-08, 16:21:52] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I'm talking about Indian AI and Indic model race
[2023-09-08, 16:23:05] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Tata can try actually, I don't see other on that scale to compete
[2023-09-08, 16:23:22] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Do you think a jio search, a jio chatbot and everything is possible. They'll just build and onboard 100 million users AI superpower will be accessed to the public eventually. Just building LLM is not a sign of power.
[2023-09-08, 16:24:52] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: They are building Infra+inference service company. JioEva.
[2023-09-08, 16:25:53] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: haptik was acquied by jio right ? for chatbot is there any other work going on there ? ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-09-09, 23:34:39] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: The Ex Machina Plan is fascinating. It basically is establishing a line of communication with the simulators by a method like "avatar". So what happens when we have an AvatarGPT? It will claim that ti can communicate with "The Source", prove itself by doing some "miracles", offer us "liberation".
[2023-09-09, 23:42:04] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Note that the paper actually uses the term "avatar", but does not define it.
[2023-09-09, 23:48:46] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: The authors probably are not familiar with the traditional definition of Avatar. The Tantric and Vaishnavite traditions actually have marker signs of Avatars. They include hallucinations and psychic powers.
[2023-09-09, 23:52:03] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: The authors however explcitly choses to ignore escape techniques based on meditation, psychedelics, dreams, mysticism, religion etc. It intentionally focuses only on hacking and social engineering approaches.
[2023-09-09, 23:55:44] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Unfortunately, no mention of Advaita. Shankara with his Mayavada has conclusively proved that there is nothing that can be done from within the simulation to escape it.
[2023-09-10, 14:15:18] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Mustafa Suleyman's new book is very insightful. A must read for people in ethics and policy to solve the alignment and containment problem. I'm half way through, and will definitely share insights here.

Eric Topol, the healthcare OG commentator, was also raving about "the coming wave" in his most recent substack post:
https://erictopol.substack.com/p/my-review-of-the-coming-age
[2023-09-10, 21:58:03] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Question for community: If one has to start a 4 yr BE engineering curriculum for AI in India, what would your suggestions and tips.
[2023-09-10, 22:05:53] Nirant K: Pay the professors and incentivise, measure graduate outcomes.
[2023-09-10, 22:07:16] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: Good math/cs foundations, not just what's hot in the market
[2023-09-10, 22:07:24] ~ YP: My old uni had that, and it was since 2018.

There are 7-8 Indian colleges that had specialisation in AI, almost all of them are data science oriented.

I wish it was done differently, what struck a light bulb moment when I started to care about this subject was this video:

https://youtu.be/0QczhVg5HaI
[2023-09-10, 22:08:06] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Even a properly structured curriculum that focus on building AI basics (some CS fundas, too), use online course work with in class expertise to assist, make it a very modern hybrid online+classroom degree.
[2023-09-10, 22:08:13] ~ YP: The day I realised neural networks can learn anything, that was a solid point in entry.

Then why do we need CNNs, and making them care about each and everything in AI firsthand.

Then work from the bottom up!
[2023-09-10, 22:08:48] ~ YP: I could share existing curriculums if that helps! 

I'll contact some of the unis from my end
[2023-09-10, 22:09:55] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: 50%+ ML uses case still need regression, 40% Xgboost and only 10% NN
[2023-09-10, 22:10:27] ~ YP: True!
[2023-09-10, 22:11:39] ~ Kunal: NPTEL courses are very good
[2023-09-10, 22:12:48] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: By the way not all Math and CS foundation is necessary and half is out dated.
[2023-09-10, 22:14:52] ~ Karthik Prabhu: Proper industry connects go a long way
[2023-09-10, 22:20:36] ~ YP: Could I DM about a concern? But thank you for snapping me out. I was aware of this, but my hindsight bias clouded me into thinking it's way beyond over.
[2023-09-10, 22:20:44] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Just to be clear: I have been approached for advice about this, and I want to make sure  we do it right way this time, and not repeat past mistakes.
[2023-09-10, 22:22:18] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Using NN for tabular or time-series data is still expensive and inefficient
[2023-09-10, 22:24:14] ~ YP: That's true!
[2023-09-10, 22:38:49] Nirant K: This was my point on measuring graduate outcomes. This is something YC and Harvard with a penchant. And they optimise for raising the ceiling, the median be damned. This is also what IITs also got right, if only by a mix of luck and intent.
[2023-09-10, 22:39:04] Nirant K: If you measure outcomes, you end up adapting _fast enough_
[2023-09-10, 22:40:21] Mihir Kulkarni WadhwaniAI, Princeton: This is a little theoretical but a pet peeve so bear with me.

This is nice to motivate students and it's theoretically powerful but it doesn't explain why deep neural networks work so well. For one, there are many classes of ML models that are Turing complete/ capable of universal function approximation (eg kernel SVMs for those of you who've seen the pre deep learning era) but they don't do as well as deep networks on language/vision tasks. Modern deep networks seem to have more capacity to learn the functions we care about on a large set of classes of datasets we care about, the reasons are definitely more involved than universal approximation, and depend on the structure of the data.

 This also came in no small measure from the fact that folks were able to build scaled up versions of these networks that exploited GPUs really well. Indeed a lot of the reason for the success of current models is just very good systems engineering-- the modeling approach itself isn't fundamentally as innovative as you'd expect with the amount of research that goes on.

Thoughts? Are the signatories respected ones?
[2023-09-11, 02:37:11] Gokul Krishnan: Could you give more context? How practical is this question? Are you asking as a dept head? A uni director? Someone who might have the ear of the above two? Or a Policy Person in the higher Ed dept? Answers, imo, vary.

Starting with, have some solid Professors in Classic CS. Think distributed/ parallel computing,  compilers, comp arch, databases etc. Then add some CS adjacent folks like NLP and CV, statistical learning etc. And as nirant mentioned, incentiveze collaborations and results and track via graduate outcomes and research/patent/spin off results. Bonus if you can maintain strong Alumni-Uni tie ups like the Chinese have
[2023-09-11, 02:47:50] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: A group of people with deep pocket and government mendate has interest in this initiative and we are supposed to advise from academic prospective and not business.

[2023-09-11, 07:49:59] Nirant K: Underrated easter egg: Pramath Raj Sinha founded both ISB and Ashoka. For someone to create institutions, which grew and earned so fast (less than 10 years) — is absolute mad respect. Money aside, this is sheer skill. 
[2023-09-11, 08:17:15] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: TIL
[2023-09-11, 09:18:03] Jay Pokarna 2014 BPCC: In a podcast he mentioned that for institutions to grow fast and earn respect from zero, they need to focus much more on teachers first than students. Get the right teachers, and make them stick for sometime and you will get great institutions, is his funda, AFAIR

[2023-09-12, 13:49:50] ~ Paddy: Thank you Divya for responding! 

We are organising a small meetup of 15-20 attendees. The purpose is to make them aware about the potential and boundaries of prompt engineering. We would be organising events every saturday staring the next one. We plan to have a theme on prompt enigeering on one of the 1st two events.

Also, this would be an in-person event in Delhi-NCR.
[2023-09-12, 13:50:30] ~ Paddy: Thank you Niant. This seems really useful. Thanks a lot! 😊
[2023-09-12, 13:52:51] Nirant K: Can safely ignore this list, no one from from NCR in the list
[2023-09-12, 13:55:48] Divya Tak: Do you have ideas about what kinds of topics you're looking for? Or who the audience is? I think prompt engineering is still quite broad for people to be able to respond to it
[2023-09-12, 15:10:19] ~ Paddy: Cool, no worries. Might be helpful when we have an online speakers in our event.
[2023-09-12, 15:10:27] ~ Paddy: A general overview. It's technical potential,  technical boundaries followed by Q&A. A clearer framework can be decided upon a mutual discussion.
[2023-09-12, 21:18:44] ~ Kunal: Hey Folks,

I'm an ex-ML person, transitioned out of ML to when Yolo was at v3 ~
I wanted to understand the landscape of ML roles today. 
1. Are there an standard responsibilities for the different types of roles out there?
2. Has genAI/LLMs created new roles and changed the way existing roles work?
3. How much software engineering and DevOps skills are required for a ML engineer?
4. Is AI Engineer more about LLMs and fine-tuning LLMs?
5.How much cross functional work is expected on a daily basis?
Would love hear your thoughts and experience as a Data Scientist/Applied Scientist/Decision Scientist/ML/MLOps/AI/CV/NLP Engineer

[2023-09-12, 22:18:57] Hasan Tech Art: Hi Kunal, I will try to reply some of your questions from my personal experience.
1. The domain of artificial intelligence is still exploding and which means that the rules keep changing and the standards don’t really apply so much but the fundamental skills and understanding of technology still goes a long way.
2. In organisational structures the rules are still pretty much there. The difference is that we in the research where the role of an innovator or Researcher is transferable to the production product easily. 
3. With the advancements of AI models, deployment and with access to Apis that we have today it’s easier to deploy a product compare to before so it is a little different.
4. With large language models becoming easier to find tune and axis. Now the role for fine tuning is also getting a little more democratised since it’s doesn’t take a lot of technical skills to do that.
5. I think that major difference that we have on the cross functionality is that the role of the technical know-how is less important. Compared to a problem solver, someone who can look at larger picture, understand the problem and find a solution.

Anyone else follow marc andreessen?
Came across his interview recently on a podcast i listen to regularly. 

It's all future speculative about the impact of AI in the future. 
An interesting point he said was that AI is likely going to be the interface for all computing in the future. So basically every piece of computing hardware has AI embedded in it, and would likely have to be connected to some kind of (not necessarily human) central monitoring authority. 

Pretty far out. But interesting!
[2023-09-19, 13:19:12] Adithya L Bhat Hackathon: His take on technology and politics is pretty interesting and even his podcasts with  Rogan also talks about the how large companies are trying to stop innovation by putting barriers on knowledge for development and and trying to shutdown open source to have monopoly

[2023-09-20, 19:06:25] Amit Bhor: Chinchilla 70B, while trained primarily on text, compresses ImageNet patches to 43.4% and LibriSpeech samples to 16.4% of their raw size, beating domain-specific compressors like PNG (58.5%) or FLAC (30.3%), respectively.
[2023-09-20, 19:06:37] Amit Bhor: Anyone understands what this means?
[2023-09-20, 19:07:27] Amit Bhor: What is the input / output to test this compression?
[2023-09-20, 19:10:38] Dev Aggarwal: "We extract contiguous patches of size 32 × 64 from all images, flatten them, convert them to grayscale (so that each byte represents exactly one pixel) to obtain samples of 2048 bytes. We then concatenate 488 821 of these patches, following the original dataset order, to create a dataset of 1 GB.” ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-09-20, 19:19:40] Amit Bhor: Lossless compression:  input -> data -> input

LLMs are prompted to compress and output the compressed data? Then the LLM also decompresses to produce the original input? ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-09-20, 19:25:33] ~ Karthik Prabhu: Isn't there a fundamental flaw for image compression using predictive models? While losses due to compression by regular image formats would he homogenized leading to resolution reduction, predictive models can pretty much output anything.. would it even resemble the original image?
[2023-09-20, 19:30:58] Prashant Nolano: This is irrelevant to the question? It's about generation part not compression?
Still doesn't answer, what do they actually mean by compression? If you have 2048bytes to compress
- how do you feed it to the model?
- what's the output?
- How do you recover the original input from the output?
[2023-09-20, 19:32:22] Amit Bhor: Obviously I'm completely missing something

[2023-09-21, 16:38:18] Nirant K: have seen this more than once — the challenge is early career folks have too much faith in generated code, and don't reason enough

seniors are partly to blame, we've reduce code to syntax skills and reduced/diminished the value of reasoning
[2023-09-21, 16:41:06] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Any link? I haven't came across any funny stuff like that recently.
[2023-09-21, 16:41:49] Kaushik Bokka: It’s funny I think I have started building this intuition of how chatgpt would approach a coding statement. 

Most valuable aspect I have found is indexing some framework docs, and have it as a pair programmer at times for quick queries.

So, first moves would always be implementing LLMs to encode it the best known way. Followed by trying to invent better algorithms by Alphacode like approaches.

[2023-09-22, 10:49:47] Nirant K: E.g. we hate so many people in power or even any authority, of misogyny or bad working conditions — in India, and other countries. The truth is society rewards them because they're useful.

[2023-09-22, 10:52:28] Nirant K: That's a very Western PoV
[2023-09-22, 10:52:49] Nirant K: And they think of tech as dystopian — which is absolutely self fulfilling prophecy

[2023-09-22, 10:59:27] Nirant K: Without taking names, there is a certain IAS officer who secretly routed a lot of hospital beds to less serious patients during peak COVID — and he did so by referring the VIPs to Ayurvedic hospitals outside the said city.

[2023-09-22, 11:00:26] Nirant K: Digressing from the topic — surveillance and tech aren't the same. It's important to blame surveillance and state excess, and not tech for that. 
[2023-09-22, 11:06:19] ~ Prajna Prayas: I think the hate is because Google and Meta took all the ad revenues from traditional news companies too fast, so it's a psy-op by them.
[2023-09-22, 11:07:42] Mihir Kulkarni WadhwaniAI, Princeton: The Luddites were not really anti tech, they were doing political action for better worker pay [https://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/what-the-luddites-really-fought-against-264412/]. Many of them were actually skilled labour. I don't say this to be pedantic but rather to point out that a lot of concerns about technology like AI are related to political economy. The labour implications are extremely significant.
[2023-09-22, 11:08:04] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: They don't know obviously or selectively ignore how much tech has done for the cause of accessibility. STT, TTS,  apps that help the blind and visually impaired etc etc
[2023-09-22, 11:11:10] ~ Prajna Prayas: BigOil, Steel, Railways, Chemicals are/were tech too. But they are not winner takes all. While current internet enabled tech is extreme power law.
[2023-09-22, 11:34:52] Divya Tak: They were definitely more winner takes all than big tech. The benefits of Google existing are percentage wise more broadly spread than benefits of oil or steam engine would have been, 20 years into the discovery.

[2023-09-22, 12:54:29] Mihir Kulkarni WadhwaniAI, Princeton: Main point is: We are not taught about them enough in schools but that doesn't mean they don't matter
[2023-09-22, 13:10:40] Divya Tak: I think erasing people from narrative erases them from existence which at a systemic level is the same as treating those classes as unimportant
[2023-09-22, 13:11:04] Divya Tak: Atleast that's how I'd interpret what nirant said. That society and systems do not consider labourers important

AI in ASIA:

Understanding its Social, Cultural and Political Impact

ICAS13 (Surabaya – Indonesia, 28-7 till 01-08 2024)

 

Since the launch of ChatGPT to the public at large the “reality” or “arrival” of artificial intelligence (AI) has pushed itself to the foreground in mainstream media. Numerous articles have been devoted to its potential but also the threat(s) it poses. While its creative potential and ability to sieve through and analyse massive amounts of data has well-noted, journalists and scholars have also flagged issues of copyright infringements, deep fakes, misinformation, job loss and even its possible application in warfare. AI certainly has gotten all of talking! Besides its integration in text and image generating tools AI also powers an increasing number of tools used in sectors such as agriculture, education, health and medicine which may not immediately reveal its reliance on AI. With this Call for Papers we are inviting presenters to participate in a panel that broadly focuses on AI in Asia as part of ICAS13: the International Convention of Asia Scholars (Surabaya, 28-7 till 01-08 2024). The intention is to bring together a broad array of papers that provide insight into AI’s use in Asia with a focus on its use, impact and consequences in social, cultural and political terms. In particular we are looking for papers that build on recent research (social sciences/humanities) and that engage with the (dialectical, entangled, beneficial and/or strained) relationship between AI, data, users an developers in the broadest sense:

·        What data does AI rely on? How is this curated and how do professionals developing AI reflect on this?

·        Who are the players in developing, challenging and (creatively) using AI in Asia?

·        What uses of AI are emerging and how is its presence impacting Asian life-worlds?

·        How is the notion of agency and questions of autonomy/intelligence negotiated vis-a-vis AI?

·        What is next for AI? Is there a way to extrapolate from research rooted in the now to develop a vision of/agenda for the future?

 

Goals:

1.      The initial goal of the proposed panel is simple: to bring together a diverse array of papers that broadly focus on AI in Asia. As such the panel is designed as an opportunity to get to learn of other scholars working on questions related to AI in Asia. We may also consider more than one panel if a sufficient number of suitable papers are proposed.

2.      Besides that the intention is to facilitate a discussion about the direction developments are taking and the possible consequences and impact this may have. Can we think of a research agenda for which we may also consider novel forms of collaboration across disciplines?

3.      Finally we hope to include a selection of papers in a proposal for a special issue with a leading journal or an edited volume with a university press. This proposal will be developed on the basis of our discussion and the synergy of the various papers presented. We think of this as an agenda setting exercise which not only allows us to showcase the latest research but also to think about what future research should consider.

 

To Consider:

·        ICAS13 is held in Surabaya from the 28th of July till the 1st of August, 2024.

·        This panel will be proposed under the conference’s theme of ‘Uneven Geographies, Ecologies, Technologies and Human Futures’. You can find out more about this here: https://icas.asia/icas13-cfp

·        Even though ICAS13 is held in Indonesia your paper may address AI in any “Asian context” you deem necessary. In this the boundaries of Asia itself are also not considered fixed to one particular interpretation.

·        We are looking for papers rooted in the humanities and/or social sciences, and welcome interdisciplinary approaches. However, if your paper is merely of a technical nature this conference may not be for you.

·        You can only presented one paper at ICAS. Multiple papers across different panels are not allowed.

·        Participants of ICAS 13 are expected to fund their own registration fee (to be announced), travel and accommodation. However, limited financial support is available. The grant application process for this will only start after the review process and qualification requirements will be made available in due course. There is thus no information available about this yet.

 

Proposal Requirements:

·        Abstract between 300-500 words;

·        Full name, position and contact details (e-mail);

·        Indication if you will be seeking outside funding for your participation or are likely to be funded through your university;

·        Please submit your proposal by Word document to: Michiel Baas, michielbaas@yahoo.com cc to baas@eth.mpg.de

·        Deadline: Monday October 16 (10:00 CET)

[2023-09-24, 01:07:18] ~ YP: Yeah, was curious! Since 8 million doesn't seem too high of a number
[2023-09-24, 01:13:47] Ambika Computational Mama: 8 million people attempting to specifically learn AI is a lot no?
[2023-09-24, 01:17:55] ~ YP: If that's entirely by self motivation, yes it's a lot! As of now when things are this early. I did imagine 8 million not being that high in the case when it's students in university are asked to sign up for that course or in future this will see rollouts from high schools as well.

There are a lot of engineering universities in India and around the world, so an enrollment could just mean the instructor asked you to enroll.
[2023-09-24, 01:18:42] ~ YP: Maybe I shouldn't dig too deep into it 😅 Awesome to know nonetheless!

[2023-09-25, 08:54:47] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: 🤷🏻‍♂️ no idea 
There’s too much speculation going on 

Trying to find a Reddit post I’d read ,which mentioned that Gobi finished training in 2022 and OAI had already trained agentic behaviour like autoGPT/BabyAGI several months before the actual projects 

Here’s link to the OP

[2023-09-25, 09:43:02] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Any speculations on self-improving autonomous agents?
[2023-09-25, 10:15:31] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: The discussion of “really close to AGI” is more likely referring to self improving agents ,and a model trained especially for agentic behaviour 

Anyways at this stage how to define AGI is still open question 

Agent behaviour is closest approximation?

[2023-09-25, 11:09:38] Ambika Computational Mama: (Open GPT based models) If you have worked with multi disciplinary teams, it’s very easy I feel. Think about it like you would when you communicate between multi modal teams. Address the LLM as a team member with their own backstory and nuance. Split into parts: 
1. Understand that LLM needs high level context like any team mate and that it’s “American” unless you tell the system prompt other wise. (This permeates through the way of interacting, referencing and output styles) 
2. To allow some space for “chain of thought”. Atleast in context of eval. This has really worked for me - esp with GPT4 - you can really make it think like you. 
3. If the Context is pure output (eg. letter/comms/report), use styles and examples. Rest of the prompt need not be lengthy. 
4. Test and compare - prompting works differently for different tasks. So eventually it’s on you. 

For chat related ask @918764022384 he has got an amazing understanding of it

[2023-10-12, 13:58:49] Sumod K Mohan: Yeah, startups are hard. One my  labmates was co-founder of DAQRI (raised $300M) and raised a lot of money and sunk. Have ex team members in Magic Leap (raised $4B), not doing too great. I learned the hardway that building on hype can be great also can be disastrous. I personally want to build something that really works and is a commercial success. For this what Sachin said felt the most reasonable approach. Shipping per capita: It depends on the culture you create in your team.
[2023-10-12, 14:27:38] Ravi Srinivasan: Is it because we don't build well or don't know what to build? Most buyers are still there... So distance to market is less?
[2023-10-12, 14:37:04] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: ^Truth is most people in India in the consumer space don't spend on AI products.

[2023-10-15, 12:15:22] Vamshi: Forking from the main group related to free vs paid AI
[2023-10-15, 12:16:24] Vamshi: I’m not sure when we’ll reach the threshold, but I think it would not be surprising to see not just free and paid AI but AI that you get paid to use
[2023-10-15, 12:17:22] Vamshi: I think past a threshold, it becomes very viable to completely split the users
[2023-10-15, 12:17:48] Vamshi: Not sure if this is utopian or dystopian, but it seems inevitable
[2023-10-15, 12:18:47] Vamshi: There will be users who train and align AI/AGI and there will be users who are trained and aligned *by* AI/AGI
[2023-10-15, 12:19:03] Vamshi: Might even be the same users in a different capacity
[2023-10-15, 12:19:32] Vamshi: In some sense this is already happening
[2023-10-15, 12:19:44] Vamshi: But not in a fully automated manner

[2023-10-15, 12:21:47] Vamshi: And human and machine agents are mediated by a common fabric
[2023-10-15, 12:22:35] Vamshi: Hopefully this evolves to a metaphor that goes beyond mere control
[2023-10-15, 12:23:23] Vamshi: Because even in a purely game theoretic formulation, there’s plenty of room for synergy, symbiosis, cooperation and play for its own sake
[2023-10-15, 12:23:39] Vamshi: It’s the playfulness that puts the game in game theory

[2023-10-15, 12:26:04] Vamshi: When you request AGI to make a computation or reach a goal, it could go to a marketplace where the futures of that computation get played out and traded
[2023-10-15, 12:26:17] Vamshi: And you can get a negative cost for your request

[2023-10-15, 12:57:56] Nirant K: Bringing the convo here on pricing and usage for LLMs: 

@919810485533 and @919899951010 made a case in favour of privacy, while the earlier claim was that direct consumer pricing should be zero/free.
[2023-10-15, 12:58:40] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: My initial response was:
Eventually yes, but asking a new technology to be free when the cost of dev runs high is not realistic. It would be like saying air travel or internet should be free for everyone when it was first invented
[2023-10-15, 12:58:45] Nirant K: I suspect there needs to be multiple buyers and pricing structures which'll evolve for LLMs since large compute providers e.g. OpenAI, Anthropic — will have different structures from say a Databricks or Anyscale, and this will be different from what might work for HDFC or Citibank.

[2023-10-15, 12:58:47] Rohit Aggarwal: I almost wanna see it as the internet is technically free and open. 

Access to the internet via broadband costs resources and this paid.
[2023-10-15, 13:00:58] Nirant K: There are atleast 3 different consumer psychologies at play here: 

Superhuman: I'm a power user and willing to pay for finite number of work-related use cases. This is me with GPT4 which helps with code, basic data analysis.
[2023-10-15, 13:01:59] Nirant K: Big Regulated Co: I'm a power buyer and user of compute as an org, but care quite deeply about compliance since that is part of how I do and get business. This is the persona which say, a Mistral and Stability will want to target.
[2023-10-15, 13:03:06] Nirant K: Big Domain Specific Co: I'm tech savvy and use compute e.g. search, LMs quite well already. I care about domain specificity since LLMs trained on web don't work for me. This is where most Bio, Pharma, Legal, Financial Services would fit in my mind.
[2023-10-15, 13:03:12] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: The market will decide if it should be zero or not, right now the market is mostly limited to tech folks.
[2023-10-15, 13:04:00] Nirant K: The 4th, or zeroth — Consumers — want free, powerful compute but will be willing to pay for this in their own data, labour and time. This is how Google Maps and ChatGPT work today.
[2023-10-15, 13:08:14] Vamshi: Speculative at it might be, the bet on AGI, as opposed to just AI, is already an economic reality currently even though it’s bordering on just an aspiration technologically speaking.

This makes conversation on trading the value of computations just within the realm of something with material consequences.
[2023-10-15, 13:08:51] Vamshi: The user groups and pricing discussion for AGI vs AI is one of kind and not degree
[2023-10-15, 13:09:05] Vamshi: The difference that is
[2023-10-15, 13:09:34] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: What is or isn't a basic need, or whether AI should be considered one is a complex question. But assuming it is a basic need, here are arguments for/againt basic needs being free from a philosophy perspective:

1. Utilitarianism: This philosophy, associated with thinkers like Jeremy Bentham and John Stuart Mill, argues for the greatest good for the greatest number. If providing free access to basic necessities (including AI) leads to greater overall happiness and well-being, a utilitarian would support free AI access to all.

2. Social Contract Theory: Thinkers like Thomas Hobbes, John Locke, and Jean-Jacques Rousseau argued that society is based on a contract where individuals give up some freedoms in exchange for protection and benefits from the state. If access to basic necessities is considered a fundamental right, it could be argued that the state has a duty to provide these for free.

3. Libertarianism: On the other hand, philosophers like Robert Nozick argue for minimal state intervention. From this perspective, providing free access to basic necessities could be seen as an infringement on individual freedom and property rights.

4. Marxism: Karl Marx argued that resources should be distributed according to need. From this perspective, basic necessities (and potentially AI) should be freely available to all.
[2023-10-15, 13:09:45] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yes I used GPT to get some of the factoids here
[2023-10-15, 13:10:41] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Which basic need is free today?
[2023-10-15, 13:10:50] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: air
[2023-10-15, 13:10:54] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I guess I'm paying for everything except Oxygen
[2023-10-15, 13:10:57] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: perhaps thats it
[2023-10-15, 13:12:55] Nirant K: Technically, people moving cities for less air pollution do pay for oxygen too
[2023-10-15, 13:14:28] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: For AI Pay (1) Money (2) Data (3) by becoming RLHF lab rat (4) Attention

[2023-10-15, 18:02:27] C Chaitanya: For me right now, AI is just software. And as pointed above, software has found different means of thriving. Freemuim, SaaS, Open, Free etc. It's a miracle that Google found a way to be free which I think has led to all this innovation.
We can't directly compare with the Internet as the Internet is infra and currently AI is application. For the Internet we pay the telcos some gate keeping money. BTW, the telcos are also fighting to get a bigger piece of the pie by trying to diffuse net neutrality.
AI as an infra models may also come.
But the simple fact remains, there is no free lunch. Someone always has to pay, we will just fight to make sure it's not us :)
[2023-10-15, 18:06:36] Nirant K: It's a different kind of software though — much like client-server was new for a bit, and so was the iPhone form factor. I am tempted to say it's as important as a databases, but I'll resist the temptation

[2023-10-17, 13:49:54] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: He left Twitter for a year or two after that tweet.
[2023-10-17, 13:50:03] Nirant K: This is true
[2023-10-17, 13:50:09] Nirant K: Should've left for longer
[2023-10-17, 13:50:29] Ambika Computational Mama: ok i guess i dont have context - but this was waste of my 3 mins to read it! :P
[2023-10-17, 13:50:38] ~ Mayank Gupta: I think the idea of that sentiment is very different from the letter of the text.
Plus Thiel is a contrarian for the sake of being one I guess ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-17, 13:50:55] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: He is trying to put all those words in one basket which is not true.
[2023-10-17, 13:50:56] Ambika Computational Mama: also literally only one patron saint is a woman - ada lovelace and i think none are of color
[2023-10-17, 13:51:52] Nirant K: No, they're indeed in the same basket. Ethics are for poor people to follow, and for the rich to implement.
[2023-10-17, 13:51:59] Divya Tak: this is what all neoliberal tech elites in the valley think
[2023-10-17, 13:52:35] Divya Tak: libertarian talk
[2023-10-17, 13:52:38] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yes, If you put it that way.
[2023-10-17, 13:52:39] Ambika Computational Mama: these are not neo-liberals - these are blatant racist right wing sentiments funneled through tech-optimist verbiage
[2023-10-17, 13:52:53] Sandesh Anand: Nothing wrong with what Thiel said per se (valid opinion from someone who builds and invests in companies), but to think a16z (and other VCs) want to promote competition is laughable. Building "winner takes all" companies has been their whole thing. Again, no value judgment, just that the language in the post and their past actions don't align.
[2023-10-17, 13:53:14] Ambika Computational Mama: ok bye gtg - if this thread is on later ill come by
[2023-10-17, 13:53:17] Ambika Computational Mama: :P
[2023-10-17, 13:53:23] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: _hey please don't be critique my ideas in a way that makes them less profitable please_
[2023-10-17, 13:54:41] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: I remember the “we need to build” manifesto written during covid
[2023-10-17, 13:55:01] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: "Society will eventually die of over stimulation" - a geothot
[2023-10-17, 13:55:03] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Right before all the investments into crypto and clubhouse 😁
[2023-10-17, 13:55:29] Nirant K: Hmm, not fair. I believe that ESG and Safety does more harm than good as well. E.g. India runs better on cheaper fuel, ESG funds make my aloo-pyaaz-shampoo-internet expensive. Safety is the excuse which OpenAI, and others have used to fight OSS — India's only real bet to compete
[2023-10-17, 13:55:50] ~ AA: They will get one right and then eveything will be a journey to the destination
[2023-10-17, 13:56:52] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Marc is well known for jumping on TechBro trends and owning them by the distribution power. It happened for Rotator vs Wordcel last year, and now with EA vs e/acc
[2023-10-17, 13:56:55] Nirant K: Sure, and today the ambit of racism is quite wide as well e.g. I genuinely believe that intelligence is real, can be acquired — ergo, societies should invest more in education
[2023-10-17, 13:57:18] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: If india ever gets as good as China it might receive the same kind of sanctions and treatment. Techno optimism , science fiction etc has an implicit assumption about which culture  of ppl will be doing it 😁
‎[2023-10-17, 13:57:21] Gokul Krishnan: ‎image omitted
[2023-10-17, 13:58:32] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Our own history and this weeks news is ample evidence for what happens when one group has technology and another doesn’t
[2023-10-17, 13:58:58] Nirant K: I'm missing context here?
[2023-10-17, 13:59:21] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: War , conflict , colonialism
[2023-10-17, 13:59:40] Nirant K: This week's news?
[2023-10-17, 13:59:59] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: There’s a section of American policy elite that believes AI will be a technology of similar proportions. To achieve total military dominance
[2023-10-17, 14:00:14] Paras Chopra Wingify: someone needs to read https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Against_Method
[2023-10-17, 14:01:45] Gokul Krishnan: Conversely, our and American recent history also says unfettered access to technology results in horrible outcomes
[2023-10-17, 14:02:05] Gokul Krishnan: I see you follow Riva Tez as well ;)
[2023-10-17, 14:02:08] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Regardless of who is right or wrong if one side has F-16s and 1000 pound bombs and the other side doesn’t it’s clear who will get massacred in the end. 
It wasn’t too long ago that india was sanctioned for developing nukes
[2023-10-17, 14:03:12] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Also why hallucinations good 😁
[2023-10-17, 14:03:29] Nirant K: Absolutely. India survives in-part because we have nuclear weapons.
[2023-10-17, 14:03:44] Nirant K: It's a very strong deterrent against our lovely neighbours
[2023-10-17, 14:04:16] Mihir Kulkarni WadhwaniAI, Princeton: Please be extremely sceptical of a16z proclamations, they have time and again shown to be acting in bad faith: creating mad hype around themes when it suits them and quietly moving on when it doesn't
[2023-10-17, 14:04:20] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: So my hot take is the worlds tech progress should never be at the whim of some white guys manifesto
[2023-10-17, 14:04:44] Nirant K: white guy is okay, ideas matter more than source and the ideas here are crap
[2023-10-17, 14:04:56] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Are in-house AI capabilities going to be a deterrent?
[2023-10-17, 14:05:29] Nirant K: Lack of them is going to be eroding and derogatory, presence is not a deterrent
[2023-10-17, 14:05:33] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Technically true but there will always be some implicit bias. We should have our own manifesto
[2023-10-17, 14:06:05] Nirant K: We don't do a great job at that tbh: https://www.bjp.org/manifesto2019
[2023-10-17, 14:06:58] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Dude don’t set the bar that low 😂
[2023-10-17, 14:07:29] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: China for eg does seem to have a technological component to its visions
[2023-10-17, 14:07:33] Amit Bhor: + crypto, web3
[2023-10-17, 14:08:59] Nirant K: Literally signed by Narendra Modi, on behalf of the Prime Ministers Ambani & Adani — it's a serious document
[2023-10-17, 14:09:09] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I'm sure being White is no longer advantageous in the AI context. We do have enough soft talent. I think our limitation is with the failure appetite. Marc will write another manifesto after two years, and our Tech leader will become obscure after a single failure.
[2023-10-17, 14:09:42] Nirant K: To be fair, it's a good thing Indian IT Leaders like Nilekani and NRN don't write these things.
[2023-10-17, 14:10:11] Nirant K: Nilekani is effective because he is away from the light. NRN writing would be an utter clusterfuck or genius, nothing in between
[2023-10-17, 14:10:15] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Does ambani really have a technological vision ? They seem happy to run on imported tech. They don’t seem to invest as much in core tech inspite of vast riches
[2023-10-17, 14:10:30] Amit Bhor: They are all self serving, the greater good is a side-effect at best. Even the cult like propaganda and grandiosity is in their own interests first. Nothing wrong with it, just needs acknowledgement.
[2023-10-17, 14:11:21] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: It's our failure that they have to stay away from leading up front. Someone in this group asked "Who is Nandan Nilekani?" a couple of months back.
[2023-10-17, 14:11:44] ~ Mayank Gupta: That exchange was quite funny 😂 ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-17, 14:11:51] Amit Bhor: Oh, i remember the $5T economy powered by Web3 which is now deleted
[2023-10-17, 14:12:06] Nirant K: Please don't market Nilekani like this, might make him less effective
[2023-10-17, 14:12:26] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: He is good. He set a vision and made it happen
[2023-10-17, 14:12:34] Pratyush Choudhury: Why is it worthwhile to write?
[2023-10-17, 14:13:03] Pratyush Choudhury: Marc has to write because he manages $35B in AUM
[2023-10-17, 14:13:09] Nirant K: Writing is how you move people, inspire them towards a shared goal
[2023-10-17, 14:13:51] ~ Shobhit Jaipurkar: I might be wrong here but why do I feel like the conversation of technology is restricted to the context of software ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-17, 14:13:57] Gokul Krishnan: A lot of the VC log have to bloviate to convince large LPs to invest with them instead of an index fund and make that moolah. NDN and Nilekani have legit businesses to run 😅
[2023-10-17, 14:13:58] Nirant K: He has to write because he manages $35B in AUM with worse returns than some Momentum ETFs in US
[2023-10-17, 14:14:09] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Of course., that's our collective failure. And that's why we are followers in tech. Just like, retweet mass for Twitter.
[2023-10-17, 14:14:31] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Science fiction can be an inspiration towards a shared future. There’s a story possibly apocryphal that CCP officials went to the US to interview scientists and engineers. And found that many of them read science fiction in their youth. From then they have promoted science fiction heavily and some of the best science fiction now comes out of there. You can see how science fiction shapes the kinds of AIs we are building.
[2023-10-17, 14:15:08] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Science fiction + economics = modern religion 😁
[2023-10-17, 14:15:54] Amit Bhor: Yes, a manifesto makes the goal bigger than mere ROI
[2023-10-17, 14:16:41] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Corporate world is 80 % the next quarter and 20 % the next 2-3 years.
[2023-10-17, 14:16:43] Nirant K: Liu Cixin has written the most widely read optimistic scifi, and he's famously pro-CCP
[2023-10-17, 14:17:33] Nirant K: He's also quite famously against "human rights" for Xanjing/Muslims in China ‎<This message was edited>
‎[2023-10-17, 14:17:39] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: ‎image omitted
[2023-10-17, 14:17:40] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I'm in support of writing. We should write too, and try things out without worrying about failure. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-17, 14:17:45] Gokul Krishnan: Three body or something else?
[2023-10-17, 14:17:54] Nirant K: Yes, 3 body
[2023-10-17, 14:18:29] Gokul Krishnan: Didn't think that was optimistic 🤔
[2023-10-17, 14:18:32] Nirant K: The thing is everyone will have something problematic to say, so evaluate ideas — be aware of source and their bias, but not grounds for discarding an idea/ideaset
[2023-10-17, 14:18:49] Nirant K: Hmm, fair — definitely widely read in e/acc
[2023-10-17, 14:19:44] Nirant K: It's a matter of time before I say something online which is problematic like Indians should ship more AI 🤣
[2023-10-17, 14:20:32] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Fermi's Paradox and Dark Forest have been fascinating for me from the beginning.
[2023-10-17, 14:20:44] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Dark forest is a mind blowing idea
[2023-10-17, 14:21:00] Gokul Krishnan: Is e/acc the new EA?
[2023-10-17, 14:21:26] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: What is the best Indian science fiction?
[2023-10-17, 14:21:57] ~ Mayank Gupta: https://www.bjp.org/manifesto2019
[2023-10-17, 14:22:32] Nirant K: That's best fiction, not just science fiction
[2023-10-17, 14:23:02] ~ Mayank Gupta: Never ignore the deeply scientific method to their madness
[2023-10-17, 14:23:04] Pratyush Choudhury: I don't think this is true, is it?
[2023-10-17, 14:23:26] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Publishing good sci-fi is a filter for a country to come out of the follower mindset.
[2023-10-17, 14:24:09] ~ Mayank Gupta: Totally agreed. It also is an indicator of how much you're thinking of science and technology as something more than a means of earning money
[2023-10-17, 14:24:24] Divya Tak: how so?
[2023-10-17, 14:25:11] Nirant K: It indicates a mix of enough surplus as a country, and optimism as a culture. Leading indicator before it starts working
[2023-10-17, 14:25:24] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Abundance solves many problems that keep the masses busy thinking about politics, religion, service, etc
[2023-10-17, 14:25:43] Nirant K: Famously, Japs and Koreans did take shots at this when they were building tech — and low key dropped out when they slowed down
[2023-10-17, 14:25:43] Divya Tak: i see. what are examples of this happening?
[2023-10-17, 14:26:16] Divya Tak: because scifi has basically existed for less than 150 years right
[2023-10-17, 14:26:16] Nirant K: Liu Cixin's Three Body Problem — Chinese writer, Computer Engineer by training
[2023-10-17, 14:26:34] Divya Tak: so i wanna understand the surplus story
[2023-10-17, 14:27:08] Amit Bhor: One common and probably beneficial thing to take inspiration from is optimism instead of dread for the future.  Making money/intelligence is the only way to a bright future.
[2023-10-17, 14:27:34] Gokul Krishnan: https://hbr.org/2013/05/six-myths-about-venture-capitalists

Myth #4
[2023-10-17, 14:28:07] Gokul Krishnan: I don't dread, but I prefer cautious optimism over irrational exuberance
[2023-10-17, 14:28:15] ~ Mayank Gupta: Science Fiction is as old as the stars in the sky and the imagination of constellations no?
[2023-10-17, 14:28:19] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: After the industrial revolution, we started having a surplus. Before that, a cast iron pan was used to get passed down for generations.
[2023-10-17, 14:28:56] Divya Tak: sci fi != fantasy
[2023-10-17, 14:29:18] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: When India had abundance we created Khajuraho

[2023-10-17, 14:31:32] Nirant K: For context, Momentum ETFs and some Smallcap Indices do 20% IRR in US
[2023-10-17, 14:31:48] Nirant K: 4% IRR is quite a lot over 8-9 years. 
[2023-10-17, 14:32:03] Nirant K: No justification for taking this illiquid risk
[2023-10-17, 14:34:10] Divya Tak: how do they convince the LPs to continue
[2023-10-17, 14:35:08] Gokul Krishnan: Same reason why a large portion of the invested capital is under active management.
[2023-10-17, 14:35:27] Divya Tak: which is?
[2023-10-17, 14:35:49] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: A lot of oil money?
[2023-10-17, 14:35:54] Divya Tak: XD
[2023-10-17, 14:36:10] Divya Tak: no i mean why wont the oil people put it in safer places?
[2023-10-17, 14:36:58] Gokul Krishnan: IMO, convince people that they can identify large returns by pointing to few past winners while happily ignoring the average return is meh
[2023-10-17, 14:36:58] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Abundance > Fantasy
[2023-10-17, 14:37:20] Divya Tak: makes sense
[2023-10-17, 14:37:29] Divya Tak: its all gambling
[2023-10-17, 14:37:39] Divya Tak: XD
[2023-10-17, 14:37:44] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Oil ppl get scammed often. I grew up there 😁
[2023-10-17, 14:37:53] Gokul Krishnan: It's fund managers talking to fund managers, who's gonna say, "you know what, just take the mean and fire me. I've have enough Ferraris and yatchs "?
[2023-10-17, 14:38:24] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Do you know about the city they are building in Saudi? May be it is easy to sell the fantasy of Distributed Network State Utopia when they have an abundance of money?
[2023-10-17, 14:39:06] ~ Mayank Gupta: From what I understand, VC represents a very small portion of the capital allocation. It's the riskiest bet, least scientific, a wild hope that some alpha emerges in the fuzziness
[2023-10-17, 14:39:29] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Wait aren’t we missing the fact that ppl with that level of wealth only put 3-5% of their wealth into these things
[2023-10-17, 14:39:30] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: They are so rich that amounts to a lot
[2023-10-17, 14:39:36] Amit Bhor: Also lot of lps invest in VCs just to be in the cool club. It's a tiny portion of their NW
[2023-10-17, 14:39:57] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: But they’re so rich it can sustain this whole group 😁
[2023-10-17, 14:40:02] Gokul Krishnan: The line?
[2023-10-17, 14:40:15] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: @917737887058 should start a GenAI fund.
[2023-10-17, 14:40:30] Nirant K: It can sustain this group and 1-2 generations. This group is smaller than some Middle Eastern families
[2023-10-17, 14:40:33] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yup
[2023-10-17, 14:40:34] Amit Bhor: 💯
[2023-10-17, 14:41:00] Nirant K: I only invest with the intent to making money 💰
[2023-10-17, 14:41:24] Amit Bhor: 2% is guaranteed
[2023-10-17, 14:41:46] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Make the group "GenAI Elites - India 2045", and visit Saudi to raise.
[2023-10-17, 14:42:01] Nirant K: If I ever run a fund, I'll waive that off. And have a hurdle rate of S&P returns.
[2023-10-17, 14:42:15] Gokul Krishnan: Saudi, SG, London all cool
[2023-10-17, 14:42:17] Amit Bhor: Then dont 😀
[2023-10-17, 14:42:35] Nirant K: 2/20 is for folks who largely know they can't make money off this
[2023-10-17, 14:43:27] Nirant K: The original Pabrai and Buffet funds were partnerships with no fees, and hurdle rates. 
[2023-10-17, 14:43:39] Nirant K: Even today Pabrai funds have S&P returns as hurdle
[2023-10-17, 14:43:42] Amit Bhor: Not VC funds.
[2023-10-17, 14:44:15] Nirant K: Yeah, VC is not where you go to make money as an investor. It's where you go to feel cool.
[2023-10-17, 14:45:00] Amit Bhor: Yes.
[2023-10-17, 14:45:10] Nirant K: Feeling cool is worth some money ofc — people are obviously willing to pay for it
[2023-10-17, 14:45:52] Nirant K: 1-4% IRR loss on less than 5% of your net worth to hang out with smart folk is actually a very good deal
[2023-10-17, 14:46:17] Nirant K: Lord and my CA knows, I've paid more than that
[2023-10-17, 14:46:17] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Also has to be seen in the context of the US dollar system where the only geopolitically safe option is to recycle them into US based financial institutions
[2023-10-17, 14:46:33] Amit Bhor: Yes, and there are some good outcomes. So it all works out. Bayc was a more direct version but no outcome
[2023-10-17, 14:47:03] Nirant K: Bayc? 
[2023-10-17, 14:47:32] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: There’s a lot of surplus dollars piled up around fhe world. Tney will eventually end up in US assets - stocks , bonds , PE , VC. Everything adjacent to this sector in America becomes godly rich while the rest gets outsourced
[2023-10-17, 14:47:52] Amit Bhor: Bore ape yacht club
[2023-10-17, 14:47:55] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I know many smart folks, but they are on Twitter, and I have always been disappointed meeting the person you described in person.
[2023-10-17, 14:48:34] Ambika Computational Mama: I understand that but context matters. And a16z cannot declare a manifesto like this with no care or thought and just big claims that they have co-opted terminologies and critical formats that by their nature work against them. So as such I have nothing against techno optimisms, but I’m annoyed that they will influence countless young hopeful technologists into behaving as if sustainablitt and environment don’t matter. As “thought leaders” such pieces add to polarisation which is obliviously a fuel for their work and agenda but is not acceptable.
[2023-10-17, 14:48:48] Nirant K: Twitter is the highlight reel of someone's intelligence, the same way that IG is the highlight reel of someone's travel
[2023-10-17, 14:49:11] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: https://docsend.com/view/e6nd457kgbg8zich

this deck covers everything wrong with venture capital very well
[2023-10-17, 14:49:43] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: From Twitter to in-person pipeline
[2023-10-17, 14:49:48] Ambika Computational Mama: Ok anyway I was too behind in the conversation
[2023-10-17, 14:50:12] Nirant K: To be clear, I love VC — VC is a net good for India. Has trained an entire generation of engineers parallel to IT Services. 
[2023-10-17, 14:50:29] Nirant K: I've worked most of my career in VC funded teams
[2023-10-17, 14:51:03] Nirant K: And I'd wish there was more of it tbh — this 15% delivery fees for Swiggy is hurting now

[2023-10-17, 15:02:11] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: From the discussion, we can conclude that Marc Andresson achieved what he wanted. Making strangers start talking about Techno-optimism.
[2023-10-17, 15:03:08] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This brings an ikigai level clarity to my thought process 😂
[2023-10-17, 15:59:40] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Last time Marc wrote “It’s time to build “. It was around 2020 wasn’t ?
Exactly when they started publicising shit crypto startups and shilling them publicly
[2023-10-17, 16:00:38] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: What’s to say they aren’t preparing to shill newest faze of AI with this ?
[2023-10-17, 16:01:16] Nirant K: I'd wager they're preparing to shill something else where they are not competing with Google/MSFT. Because it's clear Nadella will eat Marc for snacks if they do so
[2023-10-17, 16:06:04] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: What I don’t agree 100% is that market as a facilitator for technological/societal change 

Biggest inventions/leaps in tech have all come from govt  programs or govt funded programs from DARPA ,NASA
[2023-10-17, 16:06:34] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: If market was the deciding factor a lot more companies would end up like TCS ,because “maximise shareholder value”
[2023-10-17, 16:07:10] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Not that I’m dunking on TCS ,they do provide much needed services
[2023-10-17, 16:10:29] Nirant K: TCS, Infy all exist and routinely make 5+ year bets is because they maximise shareholder value
[2023-10-17, 16:10:38] Nirant K: Short termism is a more American disease than India
[2023-10-17, 16:10:51] Nirant K: The median tenure in TCS >5y in several functions
[2023-10-17, 16:13:18] Sachin Legaltech: Most of those leaps came when government was at its peak power and had monopolized the resources cause of world war and cold war. Current US government doesn’t seem to be an enabler of any good change. And those leaps helped common man after government got out of the way and let entrepreneurs like Marc build the infrastructure for internet.
[2023-10-17, 16:15:03] Sachin Legaltech: For median companies probably …But US ecosystem made it possible for companies like OpenAI, SpaceX to flourish..We have s long way to go
[2023-10-17, 16:28:42] Nirant K: American capitalism really hates average. It likes small, and really big — and nothing in between.

India is going that way too, but for most our commercial history — we've liked medium more than small and big both
[2023-10-17, 16:29:00] Nirant K: E.g. till 2014 or so, the effective tax rate for a SME was lower than individual and bigco both
[2023-10-17, 16:29:28] Nirant K: Now, the self employed individuals and BigCo pay the lowest taxes 
[2023-10-17, 16:30:53] Nirant K: TCS is larger than most European Governments, and it flies under the radar. HDFC is among _world_'s largest retail banks by assets and number of customers and damn, it's still growing 15-20% YoY. India is going to reward "large" a lot in next 5-15y.
[2023-10-17, 16:32:45] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Isn't this natural for any capitalism ? Anything that promotes competition eventually converges to this right ?

[2023-10-17, 16:33:17] Nirant K: HDFC is a $100B entity folks. It's 1/10 the size of Apple, which everyone worships — and most of these gains come from slower compounding than the one HDFC is at
[2023-10-17, 16:33:47] Harshal Bhatia: I think the "small" comes from being somewhat socialist and taking care of the "little guy". Capitalism rewards just the big.
[2023-10-17, 16:34:01] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I get what you mean
[2023-10-17, 16:34:39] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Effective altruism is what you are hinting towards I guess ?
[2023-10-17, 16:34:43] Pratyush Choudhury: Apple is bigger than that :)
[2023-10-17, 16:34:50] Nirant K: There are 3-4 listed companies in India which have higher valuation than India's GDP in 1994 — to put things in context
[2023-10-17, 16:35:45] Nirant K: Apple was $1T in 2018 na? I'm guessing NVIDIA or someone must have reached $1T now
[2023-10-17, 16:38:03] Nirant K: Why 1994? Because HDFC started that year. It's not that far ago. By simply being 20yo in 1994 and holding BSE Sensex 30 (there was no Nifty50 then) — you could've better returns than >60% investors in their 50s today.  ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-10-17, 16:44:02] Divya Tak: ha okay that makes much more sense
[2023-10-17, 16:44:31] Nirant K: As a different ratio: India's Top 3 companies today — $200 Reliance + $150 TCS + $150 HDFC — is higher than the nation's GDP when I was born
[2023-10-17, 16:45:16] Nirant K: There is a rational reason to be bullish on Indians in India, and that's not AI 🤖

[2023-10-17, 16:45:56] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: 🤣
[2023-10-17, 16:48:14] Nirant K: Our largest companies are $200B, and at a FCF CAGR of 15-25% — at a conservative estimate of 15%, in about 10 years.
[2023-10-17, 16:48:38] Nirant K: By then, Americans might have to learn crores USD though
[2023-10-17, 16:49:02] Nirant K: Because number of people who'd know crore will start to compete with those who know millions around that
[2023-10-17, 16:49:52] Nirant K: Okay, enough fin talk for the week — I'll go make some now (work)

Binks founder is a Clubhouse friend. And starting in a boring category: tailoring. I love businesses which no one else'd invest in.

Tldr; there's a significant difference in being an AI critic and an AI ethic-ist. The former outright reject AI but the latter love AI and want to ensure it's ethical use. However the two factions get mixed up more often than not (including, in the Techo Optimist piece by a16z)

[2023-10-22, 10:29:18] Sachin Legaltech: I consider AI ethics people enemy of human progress. The primary reason is at a micro level, most of us wouldn’t be comfortable having a moral police watching our behavior and criticize us according to their beliefs/ values. Same logic will apply to organizations. At this scale, we would be adding a bunch of supposedly holier than thou people whose job is criticize or cancel bunch of projects/ experiments based on their own beliefs of what would or should happen. Having an additional set of bureaucracy leads to corruption where a skilled operator will know how to get their projects approved through AI ethics; whereas rest of us will be bogged down by need to convince some supposedly more moral person utility of our project. Even if we assume AI ethics authority to be always non-corrupt (that’s a huge if), most of the scientific advances come from people tinkering around the frontier of knowledge and it’s not possible to know the impact of an experiment before even running it. Also having a subset of people studying ethics and telling others what is ethical assumes there are certain ethical values which should be shared by the entire society. Usually that’s not the case; some of us will value individual liberty much more than the rest; while some will value safety or conservation of their way of life more. Last time when Indian civilization gave a bunch people right to decide what’s ethical for the rest of the society, it lead to decline of our civilization by arbitrarily causing different prohibitions. I believe all of us together are needed to build a collection of ethical practices and outsourcing this task to a group of people will create dystopian future.

Distinguishing between AI critics and ethicists is vital; the former opposes AI, while the latter guides it. Without adding accountability to AI's "black box", it's unclear who truly benefits from its unchecked growth.
[2023-10-22, 10:38:57] Sachin Legaltech: But shouldn’t we all be guiding it and why someone with AI ethics title in their job profile should have more say in policy decisions… All of us are AI ethics people whether we use it or build it

Yes I have gotten them. For data compliance related issues by the govt.
Because some Babu woke up and decided to arrest everyone to prevent "Chinese data sharing".

If you don't think this is gonna happen in AI, you are very very very sadly mistaken.

[2023-10-22, 14:09:27] Naman (Repello): But can decision making around AI development ever be democratised? There will be laws which limit the playing surface for some but not for others, however these laws have been and will always be determined by a handful(who will claim they've taken opinions of the masses into consideration, but who knows). The job of ethicists would be to make sure that these laws are abided by much like compliance laws in present scenario
[2023-10-22, 14:18:48] Sachin Legaltech: That’s the reason we can argue that lawmakers shouldn’t interfere in research phase at all. For deploying AI products, there can be some (hopefully minimal) regulation and the people who should monitor these things would be AI compliance people - not AI ethics. By calling themselves AI ethics people, few people can do a power grab and dictate their agendas.
[2023-10-22, 14:34:22] Sachin Legaltech: I believe the spirit of enemies section of manifesto was to point out potentially dangerous ideas which can stop progress. If we check twitter feeds of notable AI ethics people, it feels that the term is getting captured by technology activists who want to stop the progress and not discuss merits of their ideas by insinuating that they are more ethical than the rest.
[2023-10-22, 14:35:30] Nirant K: ~technology activists~ → Luddites
[2023-10-22, 14:42:35] Siddharth Agarwal: Gotta disagree with you on the definition of the latter. The largest figures in AI ethics (Gebru, Bender, etc) are stridently against a lot of AI use, and are often ludditic. Their notion of ethics is often an undefined morass of American speech codes and some legit ethical issues. Still, they're quite against progress going by what they write and what they publish.

[2023-10-22, 15:03:48] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: I challenge that anybody here goes *public* with the ask that they want unrestricted unregulated access to AI research - specifically even *bias in AI*.

So u will have the right to say create a model that will generate content without checking for bias against Muslims for e.g. Or will tell you how to commit suicide.

The challenge stands.

[2023-10-22, 15:21:53] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: This is my *public* stand on using per-country self regulatory orgs. Including for alignment. 
This is the direction I'm actively pushing for.

https://twitter.com/sandeepssrin/status/1650028503251968003?t=INL0oAqLKNu9qnLwp9sHTg&s=19

The challenge stands. Let's see folks ask for zero regulations publicly.

Remember u leave yourself open to the  "muslim bias" question thrown at you publicly.
[2023-10-22, 15:23:09] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: It's not about basement or public models. The surface area of data law enforcement hits when a SINGLE consumer uses ur model.

If that single consumer is hit with bias....ur going to jail
[2023-10-22, 15:23:20] Divya Tak: And yes if your model can hurt millions of people then I hope there are some regulations that are there to guard against that. Those millions can't be collateral damage
[2023-10-22, 15:24:02] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: India has no precedent of scale based law enforcement. Insurance fraud, UPI fraud, data fraud or PII leakage is prosecuted even if you do it once
[2023-10-22, 15:24:05] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Yes. That is obvious. I mean political groups were spreading stuff about icloud privacy saying it enabled pedophiles to store child p**rn.
[2023-10-22, 15:24:13] Sachin Legaltech: There is a difference between production and research ..For products which will serve others, I am not against regulation..But for ideas whose validity isn’t tested yet and no one knows what they can do, why should there be a regulation?
[2023-10-22, 15:24:56] Sachin Legaltech: I agree with this..But products reach millions..research doesn’t..Research is about exploring new ideas
[2023-10-22, 15:24:57] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Sure. But u can't launch it. I don't particularly care about those. U keep them locked in ur basement and don't see light of day..fine.
[2023-10-22, 15:25:42] Divya Tak: That's a fair distinction theoretically. But when does a model go from research to product?
[2023-10-22, 15:25:49] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: The thing with research is - if ur consuming data ..which includes PII data, even if u lock it in ur cupboard..ur still going to jail
[2023-10-22, 15:26:18] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: The misunderstanding that a lot of people have is that "research is not regulated". Turns out the underlying pipes and data that u will use in research will be.
[2023-10-22, 15:26:51] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: So if u use caste data for ur model (doing research in ur basement)...u better be watching ur back. U don't have liability protection
[2023-10-22, 15:27:48] Sachin Legaltech: I believe hosted APIs are product ..Model checkpoints are research artifacts
[2023-10-22, 15:28:23] Divya Tak: Ha but that's your belief right? You can imagine how difficult it would be to make a policy around that
[2023-10-22, 15:28:44] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: There is no distinction. U want there to be a distinction. There isn't. The moment u touch data ..ur liable. It is not legally possible to claim protection for research purposes
[2023-10-22, 15:30:57] Naman (Repello): 😂😂no issues
[2023-10-22, 15:31:31] Sachin Legaltech: We can have a debate around  where the boundaries should be ..But regulations should be about avoiding harm - both faulty product launches and harm caused by overreach from government..right ?
[2023-10-22, 15:32:05] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: No. That is a very wrong understanding of property rights
[2023-10-22, 15:32:30] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Data is property. U coming and sitting on my lawn is illegal ..even if u think ur doing no harm
[2023-10-22, 15:33:07] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Privacy is an extension of property rights. Ur understanding of do-no-harm is not applicable or accepted.
[2023-10-22, 15:33:11] Sachin Legaltech: But I should be allowed to do the same in my house..right ?
[2023-10-22, 15:34:01] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: U can't generate ur own data. So ur argument is - "taking pictures of me through your camera in ur house and doing no harm".

Still illegal.
[2023-10-22, 15:36:05] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: So i guess the key point here is when a person enters my house are they inherently accepting T&Cs about being recorded or not, as long as they are informed ?
[2023-10-22, 15:36:08] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Nothing happens to paparazzi though
[2023-10-22, 15:37:25] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: As long as they stick to public territory I would assume ?
[2023-10-22, 15:37:37] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Ah now u come to the reason why u have RIAA and MPAA. Fair use as a legal argument in court when they send a notice to u.

Ur using fair use safe harbor. It is untested for AI models. So u better join the SRO or face the music alone.
[2023-10-22, 15:38:09] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Paparazzi are covered by safe harbor legal enforcement by the newspapers
[2023-10-22, 15:38:10] Sachin Legaltech: If you believe that all the LLMs trained are illegal and should be liable ..That’s a different topic …My stand is no regulation should be there for scientific exploration.
[2023-10-22, 15:38:10] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Cant imagine Kanye going easy on someone who enters his house  and be legally responsible
[2023-10-22, 15:38:28] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: All of these are great points why my model should be hosted in the cayman Islands
[2023-10-22, 15:38:59] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: No country I know of is offering data safe harbor protection right now. I have checked
[2023-10-22, 15:39:30] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Didn't Japan and Israel say something along this.
[2023-10-22, 15:39:31] Sachin Legaltech: https://petapixel.com/2023/06/05/japan-declares-ai-training-data-fair-game-and-will-not-enforce-copyright/
[2023-10-22, 15:40:10] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Copyright is not PII. Copyright laws are not applicable on ur medical records.
[2023-10-22, 15:40:13] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Separate law
[2023-10-22, 15:41:47] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Can you avoid PII though
[2023-10-22, 15:41:59] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Don't take that data
[2023-10-22, 15:44:17] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Might I ask if you have a legal background ? Impressed by some of the clarity in thought here. Haven't fact checked anything obviously.
[2023-10-22, 15:46:14] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I think he answered it earlier from lawsuits he had to face
[2023-10-22, 15:47:04] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Or just join a SRO and basically self enforce safe harbors.
U can't have perfect freedom here. But u can be granted safe harbor under self regulation. 

That is what OpenAI also figured out (as did a bunch of us ) https://openai.com/blog/frontier-model-forum
[2023-10-22, 15:48:09] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: I have a regulatory background. I have fought and help draft some of the earliest fintech regulations of the RBI
[2023-10-22, 15:49:35] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I guess one issue with regulation is there is a lack of trust that people doing the regulating are not doing it for vested interests
[2023-10-22, 15:50:41] Abhishek Mishra: I think it's ok to let people opt out of sharing their copyrighted stuff or PII from being used in the pretraining.

But you shouldn't stop people from organising an open source effort and contributing data willingly for building models of any scale. That's just a way to ensure you stay ahead of others because some did it without permission first.
[2023-10-22, 15:51:01] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Sure. But that's not the question is it - the question is what can u do about it ?
It's better to add your individual weight to a collective and get some freedom...versus wait for perfect democracy.
[2023-10-22, 15:51:27] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: If OpenAI could not ... I guarantee you that neither will any of us alone.
[2023-10-22, 15:51:59] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Is openai could not or does not want to because their masters don't want to
[2023-10-22, 15:52:18] Sachin Legaltech: The point is not to wait for perfect democracy..it’s about creating loud enough voices so that regulatory capture doesn’t happen
[2023-10-22, 15:53:02] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: U should Google a bit about Frontier Model Forum that OpenAI has been forced to create a long with anthropic, Google and Microsoft. All the competitors.

That is a very untrue perspective
[2023-10-22, 15:54:41] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: That was the challenge. Go public with the ask to not be regulated at all. And yes u are exposed to bias bomb questions.

I choose to do the different org having seen and failed in a similar ask over many years in a related field.
[2023-10-22, 15:54:46] Sachin Legaltech: Plenty including me do believe that they are not forced to create that forum; but that forum may be a start of regulatory capture process ..Meta hasn’t joined it; neither has laion or eleuther
[2023-10-22, 15:55:26] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: You might be right here. But it still feels that Google and Microsoft might agree to something that benefits them more over others. But will keep this into account

Location varies between SF, DC, and remote, pay is mostly between $100K and $150K, and jobs require some combination of good reasoning skills, research skills, organizedness, and domain knowledge (not all jobs require all four of those things).

@919810485533 
Interesting thought. I have been leaning towards the same, but practically I am yet to come across a large scale function that can be fully automated. Even extrapolating our existing  
Also my read is that the reason for outsourcing in these orgs, isn't that they cannot do it inhouse ( they can probably throw money at it ), but most likely they don't even want to be getting into such processes which isn't key to their topline.
[2023-10-23, 13:21:35] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Sure. But it's an ROI thing. If ur paying Klaviyo about 10 mil USD per year and if it will cost me 3 program managers with chatGPT/copilot to execute the same...the ROI changes
[2023-10-23, 13:22:14] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: The Pareto is talent X cost X accountability.

Talent and cost axes just went to zero with chatGPT.

I call this my death-of-saas proclamation. It's very incendiary I know...but very likely.
[2023-10-23, 13:23:47] Alok Bishoyi: next line of thoughts then, is the current tooling itself enough, or are there going to be more saas to catalyze this death-of-saas ?
[2023-10-23, 13:25:39] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: I call it the terraform-for-genai. I tweeted about the market curves for it today
[2023-10-23, 13:41:42] Alok Bishoyi: Flipping the question a bit : what solutions would companies not bother building internally ? 

Some obv usecases that can come up
1. Any solution would involve industry wide proprietary data or intelligence? The nature of problem/solution to which GPTX would not have been exposed to? 
2. Too complex of a problem for GPTX to be able to come up with engineering blueprint to - even w RAG / memory augmentation etc
[2023-10-23, 13:43:05] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: U should frame the question rather as - "what kind of process flows would chatGPT 6 find hard to build code for"
[2023-10-23, 13:47:22] Alok Bishoyi: Or rather ChatGPT + 3 program managers as you put above. Hmm. 

Are there any early indicators of this happening ?  What saas ( which already had PMF and scale )  will stop getting renewed in the coming quarters. 
I would discount stuff such as s/o or google search

[2023-10-25, 11:03:38] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: This is not a piece. This is actual law that is already in the EU parliament for ratification and will most likely pass.
[2023-10-25, 11:04:12] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: If people don't know, EU regulation informs  regulations around the world.
Case in point, Apple being dragged by the neck and forced to implement type C.
[2023-10-25, 11:04:42] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: EU AI Act is 1 year away from passing. It mandates model registry. I anticipate that law to be mirrored in the US.

[2023-10-25, 13:03:43] ~ Arvind Sankar: True. Just like how GDPR prompted other countries to adopt privacy laws in other countries
[2023-10-25, 13:04:31] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Model registration is a ridiculous idea. This is like asking for every GitHub repo to be licensed
[2023-10-25, 13:05:06] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Correction. It is a ridiculous *LAW*.

Its not an idea anymore
[2023-10-25, 13:05:54] ~ Arvind Sankar: But the EU AI act very limited in scope. To my knowledge, it only applies to services provided in EU that use AI. Thereafter a risk-based tier is used to determine whether use of AI in a sector is to be prohibited, regulated or unregulated.

It could still help with current policy discussions that directly address existential concerns on AI
[2023-10-25, 13:06:33] ~ Arvind Sankar: Case in point, EU AI act (I think I have to confirm this) explicitly chooses not to regulate use of AI for military purposes
[2023-10-25, 13:06:49] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: US won’t pass such laws. This AI doom crowd is one of the most puzzling spectacles I’ve gotten to witness
[2023-10-25, 13:09:15] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: My only question is is it some cynical power grab or do they actually believe such crazy things
[2023-10-25, 13:09:40] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: OpenAI iis pushing for regulation. no chance of it not happening.
[2023-10-25, 13:10:06] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Is it a conspiracy theory to think that AI doom crowd is funded by corporate interests

[2023-10-25, 13:15:12] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: I don’t understand how AI safety as a field can be so disconnected from its practice. The equivalent would be people who have never built or worked on any nuclear reactors testifying about nuclear risks in parliaments
[2023-10-25, 13:20:19] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Or consultants teaching doctors how to administer chemo
[2023-10-25, 13:32:05] Nirant K: But that is how all policy has always been made?
[2023-10-25, 13:33:18] Nirant K: It's not like Nitin Gadkari or his IAS Officers are experts on car safety, but he did make the laws on seatbelts. Even better in India — we don't have experts even testifying since our policy making is largely opaque
[2023-10-25, 13:50:17] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: with all due respect, if u complain...then roll up your sleeves and participate. 

for e.g. how many here are attending PrivacyNama 2023 - the regulatory summit on privacy in Delhi ? we all attend hackathons...but do we have the patience to engage with regulators ?

if u want to complain...get together, make an effort, create a voice. assigning malice without atleast trying is inappropriate.
[2023-10-25, 14:00:04] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Fair points.
But will say I don't think malice is being assigned on a whim. This is looking at history of the companies pushing for AI regulation. Also the reasoning given even if there isn't existing proof. But you are correct. Without an organized voice, it won't work.
[2023-10-25, 14:00:15] Nirant K: No, no. We want to complain against OpenAI. Regulators are completely fair. 
[2023-10-25, 14:00:58] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: that is not fair. if you dont try, if u dont engage and blame *history* (of all things) for the laws around AI...then you are to blame.
[2023-10-25, 14:01:05] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: go and engage. then complain.
[2023-10-25, 14:01:15] Divya Tak: This is a weird stance
[2023-10-25, 14:01:32] Divya Tak: Is this only valid for people with power and ability?
[2023-10-25, 14:01:38] Divya Tak: Or for anyone?
[2023-10-25, 14:02:03] Nirant K: The social contract between me and the regulator (as a citizen) is that I trust them to do right by me, without my involvement.  ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-25, 14:02:15] Divya Tak: Don't we construct systems for policy precisely because the responsibility can't be shouldered the individual
[2023-10-25, 14:02:17] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: for anyone. we all did this in the fintech industry. there are ample opportunities to engage. there is zero reasons for the need of any power.
[2023-10-25, 14:02:42] Nirant K: The social contract between me and the regulator (as an AI engineer) is that I never engage, never trust and leave for some other passport as soon as I can
[2023-10-25, 14:03:13] Nirant K: The social contract between me and the regulator (as an entrepreneur) is that I engage, build trust and work with the regulator

[2023-10-25, 14:04:45] Nirant K: Alternatively, I can extend this argument that I should engage with regulators on every sphere of my life: taxation, telecom, religion, electricity, roads
[2023-10-25, 14:04:56] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: sure. that is democracy isnt it?
[2023-10-25, 14:05:03] Nirant K: If I do this, who is paying my bills? 
[2023-10-25, 14:05:15] Nirant K: The regulators get paid to do this fulltime for entire lifetime in India
[2023-10-25, 14:05:27] Nirant K: _I pay them_
[2023-10-25, 14:05:44] Nirant K: I've spent 50% of my working life to pay them
[2023-10-25, 14:05:51] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: sure. its not that they dont make the law. nobody is complaining they dont work. the complaint is they dont know what you *want*. that takes effort and time. its an investment
[2023-10-25, 14:06:05] Nirant K: That's not democracy. That's collusion
[2023-10-25, 14:06:22] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: democracy is collusion
[2023-10-25, 14:06:29] Nirant K: An investment which yes, the entrepreneur can make e.g. Sam Altman flew to India
[2023-10-25, 14:06:39] Nirant K: Ambani runs a shadow TRAI
[2023-10-25, 14:06:45] Nirant K: That's perfectly fair
[2023-10-25, 14:06:50] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Isn't that libertarian
[2023-10-25, 14:06:59] Nirant K: But individuals don't have the resources to make these investments
[2023-10-25, 14:07:32] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: the truth is - it is HARD to debate policy. it is super hard to create a compelling narrative and yes it takes time.
but the question is not whether u can afford time. the question is - if u dont, u get screwed and then we all sit and cry about it.
this is exactly what happened in fintech - so learn from what happened there. engage early and spend ur time in engaging.
[2023-10-25, 14:07:32] Nirant K: Amongst individuals, not corporations or other organisations — you're advocating collusion by corporations
[2023-10-25, 14:07:48] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: no. im saying as an individual. go and write. thats all
[2023-10-25, 14:07:56] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: where did corporations come into picture?
[2023-10-25, 14:07:57] Nirant K: This is a fair argument to make.
[2023-10-25, 14:08:38] Nirant K: The opening argument was what motivates OpenAI to demand regulation. Sam visited Delhi, not Bengaluru.
[2023-10-25, 14:09:22] Nirant K: I don't think engineers like me can even get invites to these things. I've tried and failed enough times and reached apathy. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-25, 14:16:04] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Regulators are in famous for bringing down a sledge hammer on sectors they don't understand very well or are uncomfortable dealing with the subject. This is what everyone is scared of. Happened to FLDG, happened to Crypto and can happen to AI. But unlike other two, for AI the govt. sentiments seem to be - "let's take it case by case and not interfere too much". This is fine only till something major breaks! It is much better to clarify what is allowed/not allowed early on. The cost of redoing certain parts of process/operations/software is just shattering for orgs.
[2023-10-25, 14:31:54] ~ Vikas: in case of FLDG, new regulations will help in long term
[2023-10-25, 14:40:31] Saurabh Karn Nyai: That surely is the hope
[2023-10-26, 09:31:25] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Fair point. I think there is merit in discussing regulation too, but that is effective when regulators also have taken the time to develop sufficient subject matter knowledge. In the parlance of TRL - the issue with breakthrough innovation like AI tech is that we don't know what a TRL9 system will look like when we have a TRL3 system. So regulators come expecting a tractable regulation that "makes sense" but are often disappointed when there is higher complexity. Even despite this I think there is value in discussing AI regulation.
[2023-10-26, 09:34:05] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Sincerely think that these are not 1-to-1 comparisons. Every sector is different and so is every technology. Regulators also often look at the broader societal effects, such as 2nd order or 3rd order effects of a technology. Proponents normally stick to the known merits of a technology around which systems are built and some risk mitigation that is specific to the system.
[2023-10-26, 13:54:01] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: The real issue that needs to be clarified is not AI doom but copyright

[2023-10-26, 14:54:32] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Whether the output of a machine is copyrightable at all is unclear. 
Whether the output of an AI model is “sufficiently transformative” to not infringe the original is also unclear
[2023-10-26, 14:59:28] ~ Arvind Sankar: The jury is out for the first one. My take is GenAI as it is right now is a tool, and its wielder should have the copyright.

Whether the output of a *human* is "sufficiently transformative" to infringe the original is also not clear, and this helps to put food on the table for IP Lawyers
[2023-10-26, 14:59:50] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Yeah but we don’t have enough lawyers once machines are in the game

[2023-10-26, 18:46:46] Vamshi: If a company can be accorded a legal and constitutional status comparable to a person, it should be possible to use a similar legal framework for an algorithm for any IP no?

Is there a complication?

A company/corporation is just a piece of legal machinery that’s recognised?
[2023-10-26, 18:47:27] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: There’s still a person signing off in these situations on behalf of the company.
[2023-10-26, 18:48:17] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Unless it is a crypto company 😁
[2023-10-26, 18:48:31] Nirant K: We gave personhood to companies because it helps individuals transact with them. This is not the case for "algorithms" just yet. But that's definitely possible.
[2023-10-26, 18:49:22] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Already tried in crypto domain. No cookie. There's enough literature on this already. 
Funnily  OpenAI has a grant for governance of ai in a decentralised way.

[2023-10-26, 18:53:02] Vinod Ganesan Sarvam: What sort of legal framework would you like to bind an algorithm to and why?
[2023-10-26, 18:53:17] Vinod Ganesan Sarvam: Possibility aside, what is the purpose?
[2023-10-26, 18:55:26] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: I’m wondering the answer to very practical questions 
- Does LAMA 2 violate copyright laws 
- If I train my model but I use LAMA , GPT etc for eval , Data augmentation does this violate copyright? 
- it’s like ship of theseus. How far do you disassemble and remix data until it becomes “different” ? 

If you want to build a large company you face the risk that some legal ruling suddenly makes all your models illegal
[2023-10-26, 18:57:03] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Another question - what is the legality of training on GPT 4 output. IIUC this is not illegal but it violates openAI terms of service. So they can kick you out but that’s it.
[2023-10-26, 18:58:23] ~ Bharath: The Company and its officers are still liable (the concept of officer-in-default holds all individuals responsible for oversight leading to an offence to be liable in several cases. 

The law doesn't quite allow complete dissociation between the people running the Company and the Company itself as far as I know.

One of the reasons for incorporating a company is to separate liability (Vijay Mallya got stuck because he personally guaranteed the Co's debts going by what I've heard), but officers are not entirely exempt.
[2023-10-26, 19:11:02] ~ Bharath: The concept of effecting a transformation and such others play a large role in  determining violation, as someone had pointed out earlier. I've been awaiting a ruling in Matthew Butterick's case for long now so we could see how the US courts interpret this specific matter, but it is not forthcoming.

The other interesting thing to note is that unlike Patents, copyright is usually vested without formal application. So the magnitude of the impact one way or the other is huge ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-26, 19:18:10] ~ Bharath: Hey, ignore the transformation part to determine infringement of copyright. That is for Patents, not copyright
 My mistake. For Copyright there are several other tests ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-26, 19:19:01] ~ Arvind Sankar: 1. Existence of llama doesn't violate any copyright. It may generate content that is in violation of copyright. But there may be fair use defences for it (ex personal use, not commercializing/affecting trade or commerce of original work, etc.) What is unclear is who should be made liable if it produces infringing content.

2. I don't think so. If you are using other models for eval, output of those models are not copyrightable. Unless the model also generates infringing content, should be a problem.

3. We don't know how human mind creates stuff. It could be the case that we assemble and disassemble whatever art we have been exposed. 
But even boring compilations (such as compiling questions from govt exams into a book) are granted copyrights of they require "modicum of creativity", and like standards (differs from country to country). Most IP laws are interested in the output (difference between original and infringing work) rather than the process
[2023-10-26, 19:19:54] ~ Arvind Sankar: 2. *Shouldn't be a problem.
Again unless their TOC say otherwise, as you pointed out earlier
[2023-10-26, 20:30:31] Vamshi: Just to take the idea of an agent to the natural conclusion, and impedance match it to the laws available and maybe find the closest match we have.

The closest match may not be good enough, but it gives us a baseline to start the discussion for a new framework.

I like the idea of starting with the democratic process though. Then each nation state can adapt it.

I think the fairly involved programmatic machinery for block chain based contracts failed because they overstepped the established order of the nation state. 

Regulation still has to live with the basic tenets of human organisation as of today, and this involves boundaries established with blood, literally.
[2023-10-26, 20:31:57] Vamshi: Sad but true, and trying to evolve past those boundaries “too fast” causes collapse
[2023-10-26, 20:36:29] Vamshi: This doesn’t mean there won’t be people willing and able to stake blood with new machinery
[2023-10-26, 20:36:42] Vamshi: The Pirates of AGI if you will
[2023-10-26, 20:37:44] Vamshi: But that’s the “other side”. There has to be a side that can be taken that involves a merging of democratic consensus with algorithmic optimisation.
[2023-10-26, 20:41:31] Vamshi: You would imagine that this side would have something to do with collective wisdom, open source etc, but it’s evidently a slippery slope with the biggest leader of “Open” AI having back tracked from openness.

Not saying they did the wrong thing, just acknowledging that it isn’t easy.
[2023-10-26, 23:23:04] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: There are no fair use defences. Meta has not provided indemnity.
[2023-10-26, 23:24:32] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: If u create a co with Llama2...u are responsible for any legal problems arising from copyright. This is part of the agreement u sign before u download Llama2.

My personal suspicion is that this is why meta opensourced its models. It contains a lot of copyrighted or worse (private conversations on Facebook).

By spreading it far and wide gives it some kind of indemnity to use those same models internally.
[2023-10-26, 23:24:47] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: But long story short, there is zero indemnity. Ur on your own
[2023-10-27, 00:03:38] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: This is an amazing answer.
[2023-10-27, 00:04:07] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: That’s a conspiracy too far but yeah

[2023-10-27, 10:36:14] ~ Arvind Sankar: Indemnity is different from copyrights and fair use. Copyrights/fair use is provided by law/statute. Indemnity is basically a contract between two people to the effect that if the first party will compensate for any losses suffered by second party due o the contract. Even if Meta agrees not to indemnify for any losses (say someone sues you for infringement) suffered by you due to use of Llama, you could still say something like you used it for personal use (which is an example of fair use), and not for any commercial use. 

But you are right when you say you are on your own if someone sues you for your model creating infringing content. Whether that someone succeeds is a different question altogether.
[2023-10-27, 12:51:09] Kashyap Kompella: On the limited point of indemnity, large platform vendors have started offering some level of indemnity in response to enterprise customer demand.

[2023-11-01, 10:54:29] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Andrew NG on the white house EO's efforts at regulation :

"The right place to regulate AI is at the application layer. Requiring AI applications such as underwriting software, healthcare applications, self-driving, chat applications, etc. to meet stringent requirements, even pass audits, can ensure safety. But adding burdens to foundation model development unnecessarily slows down AI’s progress.

While the White House order isn’t currently stifling startups and open source, it seems to be a step in that direction. The devil will be in the details as its implementation gets fleshed out -- no doubt with assistance from lobbyists -- and I see a lot of risk of missteps.  I welcome good regulation to promote responsible AI, and hope the White House can get there."

[2023-11-02, 09:25:04] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Made me think about what kinds of core capabilities foundation models should be built for, and what this means for application layer development. Perhaps there are a few strategies that are necessitated by these constraints.

[2023-11-02, 09:35:57] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: unrelated question, is dev day livestreamed for others or recordings will be made available by any chance , any idea ?
[2023-11-02, 09:37:05] ~ Kaustubh: What exactly happened?
[2023-11-02, 09:37:06] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: interesting.. but foundation models can be leveraged by bad actors with lot of gpus/funding to create such models even in the future no ?
[2023-11-02, 09:41:10] ~ YP: Speculation on what's going to happen - Nov 6 is the OpenAI's dev day ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-02, 13:42:24] Vamshi: This is the less interesting part. The more interesting part is that you’re not even random, per this interaction!
[2023-11-02, 13:43:25] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: The more interesting part is that this message too was not random, neither is this one from me you're reading.
[2023-11-02, 13:43:32] Vamshi: It would be interesting if it was statistics and probability, but it’s biased in the favour of being clockwork, and takes work to make it plausibly stochastic 😮

[2023-11-02, 13:45:07] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: This reminds of the game we used to play in school similar to Rock paper scissors but it was cricket. Some ppl were shockingly good at predicting what you would do

[2023-11-02, 13:49:00] Vamshi: She thinks there’s no free will, is that what you’re saying?
She has interesting takes on the connection between randomness and the measurement problem, comes pretty to being intuitively satisfying, but then she jumps back to a mechanistic interpretation, iirc
[2023-11-02, 13:49:37] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Isn't this the way to all science ?
[2023-11-02, 13:49:52] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: As in what other process is possible ?
[2023-11-02, 13:50:49] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Develop intuition followed by rigorously proving I mean
[2023-11-02, 13:50:55] Vamshi: The measurement problem is still a problem 🙂
[2023-11-02, 13:51:21] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Agreed
[2023-11-02, 14:02:28] Vamshi: On a very different note, but tangentially related this was trending some time ago

[2023-11-07, 21:02:14] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: It’s true . This is one reason companies invest in open source
[2023-11-07, 21:03:10] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: The counter would be it depends on if ML is core to the business or a side tool used by it. For a business they want to commoditize their complement

[2023-11-07, 21:04:25] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: For meta for eg AI is not the core business . But if there’s more AI social media will benefit overall .
[2023-11-07, 21:05:01] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Metas open source AI is a really masterful strategy
[2023-11-07, 21:05:20] ~ YP: This was one reason I didn't like regulation

[2023-11-07, 21:11:40] Shashwat TDC: If there is more chaos, social media will benefit overall. 

Chaos can come from AI, exposing corruption (like in case of X), War, Covid, etc.
[2023-11-07, 21:11:55] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: No it massively reduces the cost of content moderation
[2023-11-07, 21:12:04] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Margins will go up long term
[2023-11-07, 21:12:30] Shashwat TDC: Hmm that too. But don't need to opensource for that.
[2023-11-07, 21:12:34] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Also it can be used to create more engulfing products
[2023-11-07, 21:12:42] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: It will make it cheaper and better

[2023-11-07, 21:13:18] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: A big bottleneck to social media scaling now is content moderation. If it’s truly automated it can open up the space too
[2023-11-08, 07:52:10] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: So what is a solution to deepfakes btw reg content moderation btw ?
[2023-11-08, 07:53:08] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Hearing a lot of celebrities now complaining all over the internets. So one query was that I think even before AI, imaged used to be morphed right ? But, the advent of AI/LLMs are making it faster to generate even video/voice morphing and this has rattled many Indian celebrities of late.

[2023-11-08, 12:02:08] Ankur Pandey: Hi folks, I'm having a lunch meeting today with Aalok Mehta (policy lead, OpenAI). What can be useful things to ask?

Some things I planned to discuss are:

- Red teaming  - Should startups do it? Is it imp for oss models? Shall we expect robust measures by commercial LLMs?
- What regulations should we expect (country wise) in coming months?
- What's OpenAI take on AI safety? Is it solvable by RLHF/ Constitutional AI type of stuff, or Yudkowsky level difficult, or somewhere in between?
- Scope for security / safety startups
- How can OpenAI help in social causes like Elections '24 (for ex how Dev Agrawal partnered with Digital Green to build farmer.chat)
- Will hallucinations be "solved" soon enough?
- Take on misinformation / take on second order effects of GenAI
- Opportunity for startups in general. His version of "moat"

Anything else?

[note : he's more of a policy / tech governance kinda guy]
[2023-11-08, 12:02:58] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: The problem will solve itself after ppl realize nothing can be trusted
[2023-11-08, 12:04:21] ~ Abhilash Inumella: How are ensuring Identity theft using AI assistants and agents doesn't happen? authorisation mechanisms to enforce whilst preserving privacy?

[2023-11-08, 12:07:07] Ankur Pandey: Good one
[2023-11-08, 13:31:41] Varshul Dubverse: Hey I met him in Delhi some 2 weeks back. Just a caveat - he is ex-OpenAI. Tho he was involved in launch of chatGPT but from a distance. You should pick his around how US is thinking about Policy since he is working closely with Congress.
[2023-11-08, 14:09:51] ~ Parth: enterprise support of openai  requires insane billing/up-front commitments. Is that a conscious decision to gatekeep the support to only serious and big ticket players and not startups/mid level companies?
[2023-11-08, 14:10:36] Nirant K: I don't think "service those who can afford it" counts as a policy decision
[2023-11-08, 14:11:01] Nirant K: Is there a market for a neutral "Model Rating Agency" like Moody's or S&P?

[2023-11-08, 14:14:29] ~ Parth: it would right because it would go against competitive policies that you are practically gatekeeping SoTA tech to only folks with deep pockets?
[2023-11-08, 14:15:38] ~ Parth: any insights besides the quality issues as to why they pulled down the ai/gpt detector? Are they looking at fingerprinting text and voice content generated by whisper and openai APIs? ‎<This message was edited>

OpenAI’s plans like marketplace, integrations, etc. I wanna see this as a tectonic pivot in SaaS thoughts. Though my entrepreneurial mindset says that every adversity is an opportunity but I want to acknowledge that it’s an adverse moment. 

It’s like an Industrial Revolution moment where ppl were hostile towards machines that it took the jobs, if not today or in a 10 years window. 

The new programming language is gonna be English

Every company needs an AGI with custom prompts/instructions across multiple teams, humans are the copilot to that custom AGI

Exciting times ahead. Value prop and the speed of execution is the only moat.
[2023-11-08, 16:20:22] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: This is over stated imo

[2023-11-08, 16:21:32] Saairam SRK's friend: Ya, just a bit of coffee and/or folding 10 year window to 20 year window.
[2023-11-08, 16:21:48] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Even 10 maybe too optimistic
[2023-11-08, 16:23:44] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: The hard part of programming is not the syntax. In fact most users just want a button that does the thing. If you can provide that button the cheapest and fastest tney don’t even want to write a prompt
[2023-11-08, 16:25:38] Pratyush Choudhury: Disagree, don’t think the new programming language will be english
[2023-11-08, 16:25:55] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: As a pre cursor to GenAI I worked on adding a small text box you can type in into the flow . A lot of users don’t even want to type a few characters
[2023-11-08, 16:26:07] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: It works well when ppl type but a lot of ppl don’t even want to do that
[2023-11-08, 16:27:32] Saairam SRK's friend: My thoughts were, why we need a button in the first place
[2023-11-08, 16:28:22] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Button is implementation detail it can be triggered via a voice command or a text. But someone has to remove all the complexity and do all that thinking for the user.
[2023-11-08, 16:28:59] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: It’s very easy for programmers to think everyone will write code . We still cannot teach everyone maths to a high enough standard
[2023-11-08, 16:33:50] Saairam SRK's friend: K, whatever the company’s / startup’s internal workflows / processes could be nitroxed by this marketplace model. 

Wish OSS is mature, which democratises but B2B SaaS and we get Linux distro type OSS marketplace for AGIs. But as a whole, B2B SaaS could be wrapped in this marketplace, if not everything. Almost everything
[2023-11-08, 16:35:22] Saairam SRK's friend: My apologies if I’m missing something and I couldn’t connect with software knowledge and the generic knowledge exposure. :) would definitely be a good beer talk. 🍻
[2023-11-08, 16:37:57] Saairam SRK's friend: Optimistically, B2B SaaS can be wrapped with English.
[2023-11-08, 16:38:13] Saairam SRK's friend: Curios if
[2023-11-08, 18:20:03] ~ Vinay Mimani: One of the programming languages will be English. But there will be talks in older, more descriptive languages still.
[2023-11-08, 21:49:08] Ankur Pandey: Important / relevant points from the meeting. (All are personal opinions so may have biases for all I know!):-

-- The guy was till recently Policy lead @ OpenAI. He just quit and now he's an Eisenhower fellow studying the labor disruptions caused by AI.

-- He said OpenAI is more startuppy than what perception is. It's well known that ChatGPT success was a surprise to them, but even GPT3 success was! He also had not very charitable views on ethics / responsibility by Sam / OpenAI & hence he quit.

-- OpenAI didn't have a lot of success selling "directly" to large enterprises & even less in Govt. V few have plans to use GenAI in consumer facing applications.

-- He thinks AI safety audits & similar stuff is coming. He thinks that for fine-tuned models securing weights / params is a cybersecurity problem where startups can enter, but unsure of where else they can (context of safety).

-- He said OpenAI wants to earn money to earn money not necessarily because AGI is far but because they want to be as independent as possible.

-- OpenAI scrapped the whole fingerprinting coz it was more difficult then they realized.

-- He also thinks we will see a lot of national initiatives to build homegrown LLMs - for many reasons including sovereignty. Countries like India may (should?) invest in creating quality datasets for low resource languages.

-- He wants to get connected to people who are working in (a) AI safety (b) Digital literacy (DM me, will PYIT). If you're in Mumbai - he can meet you in person (till next week) & will buy lunch.

[2023-11-08, 22:33:48] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I would be interested to talk about Digital literacy and what he thinks about what we are doing with Agriculture. Tax topic is just an opinion ping ping as no one is expert or insider.

Very counterintuitive in a world filled with Social Media and AI everywhere.
[2023-11-11, 23:22:51] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: The test consists of 12 to 14 lines of the lowercase letters d and p, depending on the version. Each line has 47 letters, and there are one, two, three or four small vertical markings above or below each letter. The test taker must cross out each letter d that has two markings as accurately as possible but also as quickly as possible because the time is limited to an average of 20 seconds per line.

An OpenAI Solutions Architect ships more than most senior devs do. 

How do I get even 1/10 as good as an engineer there?
[2023-11-14, 22:51:03] Nirant K: PS: I've already asked this question to ChatGPT and it asked to fuck off politely

[2023-11-15, 00:11:36] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Tech has become too much about bureaucracy and the bad aspects of “management” , “roadmapping” “alignment” and all this fake work. The worst waste of time is doing pointless work that only serves political purposes
[2023-11-15, 00:21:15] Nirant K: Very confusing man, you just said I'd be more impactful at OpenAI because it's an org

[2023-11-15, 00:21:50] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Big orgs / bureaucrats = bad for shipping fast
[2023-11-15, 00:22:22] Nirant K: So if Google starts shipping, it's right? Is MSFT right now, since they ship too?
[2023-11-15, 00:22:56] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: It’s also about core values and alignment. We all care deeply about shipping cool AI products . 
Microsoft is actually doing quite well for their size. Google has done terribly
[2023-11-15, 00:23:24] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: OpenAI has a core alignment around bringing cutting edge research into the hands of users as fast as possible while building AGI

[2023-11-15, 00:29:25] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Teams have to built very carefully and consciously. Blindly hiring ppl at mass scales like buying aloo pyaaz at the leet code Mandi and then building a whole “management” around it is part of the problem

[2023-11-15, 01:10:52] Vamshi: Rough seas ahead
[2023-11-15, 01:48:31] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Of course, they are efficient, but you also have to consider how much they spend in ScaleAI to take over the entire Data stack while they code. The worst and most time-consuming part of the whole operation is dealing with data, curation, RLHF, etc.
[2023-11-15, 01:49:07] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: That is available to many other players
[2023-11-15, 01:49:19] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Not to startups but the big ones
[2023-11-15, 01:49:34] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Figuring out Data pipeline and strategy is what setting up OAI apart
[2023-11-15, 01:49:58] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: But ai agree the hard work of the labelers etc should not be erased or down played

[2023-11-15, 10:22:59] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Possibly the gap exists because all of us are reacting to OAI.While the internal teams would have already have been researching ,testing ,executing multiple use cases much before than any of use realise and would have had breakthroughs even before the research papers were released to the public.

Like someone had mentioned OAI had probably figured out Agents almost a year back.

[2023-11-16, 00:47:24] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Knowledge graph construction and reasoning algorithms are very data efficient. It will be needed to plug the gap until a model can truly learn real time

[2023-11-16, 04:02:00] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: The idea is to let LLM do the reasoning, larger context windows may enable larger KBs to passed for processing.
[2023-11-16, 04:03:14] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: LLMs need to run code to reason in the general case

[2023-11-16, 04:06:50] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: That’s what I want to do instead of running reasoning code, which has been proven slow and the reason we are trying to solve AGI using NN and not KGs.

[2023-11-17, 10:15:09] Nirant K: There are no fine lines in AI, because there is no clear definition of AI either
[2023-11-17, 10:16:05] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Not to sound cryptic but for AI to be highly regulated, there has to be an Oppenheimer moment.
[2023-11-17, 10:16:07] Nirant K: E.g. I'd say irrational supporters of a political ideology are NPC or AI, while TikTok/IG Reels Recommendation is also AI. This is not AI as per Sam Altman. 
[2023-11-17, 10:17:05] Nirant K: No, it'll get regulated the same way nuclear energy got shut down: Competition & Fear.

Fear is such a carnal, overpowering emotion — it shuts down all reason
[2023-11-17, 10:23:48] ~ Kishore M R: Fear mongering works best. Its real that the AI/AGI goal post is ever moving one. Being in the hedonistic treadmill, I have more or less got used to the GPT4 capabilities in daily use for the past 7-8 months and the wow factor will kick in only when something better comes out.

Forget about AI alignment,there’s serious misalignment of board members incentives.

Any sensible business minded board member would be content to let Sam print money for OpenAI and not risk letting others capture market share by firing him.

If Altman did something wrong, I don't think GB would be quitting for the sake of it. I don't think we will find out the real reason unless SA goes on the Joe Rogan podcast again!

I don't buy any of the reasons especially around his lack of competence or his sister's abuse claims.

[2023-11-18, 09:04:33] ~ Akash Singh: There feature and product release will be impacted like in last 1 year they shipped heavily. Maybe more open source now and less business. But since Microsoft has also invested in oai how they are gonna react or they already knew.

They did come together for crisp cash too 

And just blaming sama perspective, isn't making sense now

[2023-11-18, 10:59:57] Nirant K: The downside of using gmeet is that the call actually works, with Teams you can just go "Can you hear me?" and "Unable to join" for first 20 min of a 25 min call
[2023-11-18, 11:00:31] Nirant K: You know they mean business when they call you on gmeet instead of Teams.

[2023-11-18, 12:46:06] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: 4 things i have been wondering about  :

1. The founder of Poe, Adam D Angelo, on open ai's board, 
doesn't that sound like a blatant CoI(conflict of interest) ?

2. MSFT lost 80 billion in valuation today!
I bet Satya is "concerned" to say the least, 
especially if this sparks an exodus of talent from OpenAI !

3. What will @karpathy's next move be ?
My bet is he will join Sama & Greg in whatever they do next

4. is the EA(effective altruism) gang at openai behind  this decision ?
Ilya & the other folks on the board seem to be e/acc  proponents ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-18, 21:58:27] Subbu Rama: The past 16+ hours have been interesting wrt openAI / Sam Altman etc and I believe will likely impact the AI world quite a bit in coming weeks & months (some good, some bad 🤷‍♂️) 

I just wanted to share my thoughts on this whole openAI / Sam Altman Saga, and hear what others are thinking … 

Prediction (wish): OpenAI open sources all their tech , to become truly “open” as their original founding mission. Story of Linux or Kubernetes repeats. Every one builds on top of openAI truly advancing AI for humanity. 

Microsoft’s  $13B investment 🤷‍♂️

Popular or unpopular opinion? 

Maybe it’s more complicated than that..

The original vision of forming openAI was not making money but to be an “open” foundation to advance AI for humanity. I understand one needs money to advance AI too, and for someone like Microsoft to invest money they need to see profits as obligation to shareholders. 

OpenAI hasn’t published or shared any core models or code in the open for quite a long time. Somewhere along the way, I feel the original vision of true openess was lost. 

I feel one has to pick - either be truly open or act as a business . Being in the middle or gray is hard. 

Irrespective of all the above , in my opinion, Sam Altman is a great entrepreneur & visionary. Just that his interests & the board’s on the governance etc didn’t align. 

Irrespective of all the above , in my opinion, Sam Altman is a great entrepreneur & visionary, and seems passionate about advancing AI. Just that I m guessing his interests & the board’s on the governance etc (for profit vs non profit) didn’t align. 

Likely this may have something that could have been brewing internally for quite sometime. How the board acted on this & communication etc, could have been done better. Though everyone in the board is well skilled, it was also a fairly young board , with not enough world experience. So could be argued as some immaturity , ego , emotions that played here. But we also don’t know all the details.

Thoughts?
[2023-11-18, 21:59:44] Nirant K: Bit of a leap to call the board "skilled" — some of them are 2021 grads :) ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-18, 22:04:40] Subbu Rama: Valid point. But lot of these modern AI themselves are new (esp modern AI LLMs which really came into trend like 5 years ago) . 

Skill & experience are two different things imo. Skills can be gained quickly, but experience takes time (not many short cuts ). 

Just a thought.

So Jeremy is more bullish on agi now than it was earlier. Do you think it means openai will focus less on killing startups now?
[2023-11-18, 22:17:33] Ravi Theja: OpenAI might focus less on killing startups but Sam+Gdb might as they are more product focussed 🤔

but then real question being if we would be the one on receiving end

Will see about agi. I'm skeptical on it
[2023-11-18, 22:21:40] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: He apologised thankfully

Also, they thinking that spilling the beans on friday would create less havoc, thinking they made a PR move
But people are free on weekends, more news into picture
[2023-11-18, 22:34:35] Rahul Chhabra 2016: Safetist agenda is to develop powerful AI but keep it closed and protected to minimise misalignment and misuse. OpenAI likely gonna become lot more secretive and more involved w govt coordination going forward. 

Also unlikely MSFT doubles down any more unless highly credible CEO takes over reigns.

[2023-11-19, 03:25:51] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Quite convinced now that those who said we should not depend on any one company or its closed models are right. 
If you’re making your plans based on some private companies roadmap , shipping velocity and priorities and the model is such a fundamental part of your system it’s too risky
[2023-11-19, 03:26:14] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Unless you have a strong signed contract with that company
[2023-11-19, 03:26:55] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: On the other hand only a few companies have the data or the GPUs . It’s a complex problem
[2023-11-19, 03:28:14] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Also Ilya I tnink is wrong. Now that people will realize we need multiple alternatives it will accelerate the arms race and speed things up further. You can’t put the genie back in the bottle
[2023-11-19, 03:32:45] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: “Sam Altman, the recently ousted CEO of OpenAI, has been telling investors that he is planning to launch a new artificial intelligence venture, according to a person familiar with the matter. Former OpenAI president Greg Brockman is expected to join the effort and the project is still in development, the person said. The exact nature of the venture wasn’t immediately known.

More details, meanwhile, have also emerged about Altman’s broader ambitions in developing AI. He has been in discussions with semiconductor executives, including chip designer Arm, on Friday morning about early efforts to design new chips that would lower costs for large-language model companies like OpenAI, a person familiar with the talks said. That effort would likely take years. It couldn’t be learned whether Altman was representing OpenAI or a separate venture in the discussions.”

Their core personal alignment/character differs with respect to their mission with OpenAI. So Ilya got the board on his side and removed Sam, when he saw things were going out of his control, given the influence Sam captured in last 2 years. It's simple and human nature

Not saying Sam Altman has done things but please don't support crypto schemes 😂😂😂 ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-19, 13:24:57] Amogh V: If you are talking about Worldcoin, I don’t think someone of Altman’s caliber needs to start a MLM scam. You need to be in the arena trying things. Not everything works out. Disparaging is easy building is hard.

[2023-11-19, 13:28:43] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: I am seeing truth.

Sama did YC. Built a couple startups. Then built and evangelised chatgpt, before anyone else believed that they could do it. World coin is crypto that solves a real problem. Probably ahead of its time for now.

I don't know many people who had a trillion $ product on their hands and then went and made the kind of deal with Microsoft that he made.

[2023-11-19, 13:33:09] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: There can be multiple truths
Sam built OpenAI and is a world class entrepreneur 
Sam also started WorldCoin which is /could be a scam 

Both these statements can be true at the same time without invalidating each other 

We should be able to hold  multiple truths at the same time without falling to binary thinking
[2023-11-19, 13:33:17] Divya Tak: I also think, all criticism can't be invalidated as "you just don't understand"
[2023-11-19, 13:33:21] Divya Tak: Yes
[2023-11-19, 13:35:31] ~ YP: Yeah that is true 

Infact, if the one criticising can have the ability to sit with the idea and see all the good and bad sides of it

Then take the stance then that's great already

I think we probably would have. But it would've taken longer than it did.
[2023-11-19, 13:44:46] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: Nowadays alignment is a big part  of model training these days bc open ai championed it in the begining and this happened during sama's tenure

Something about dev day? Or something about monetisation plans in the near future?

There is some risk for sure with advanced AI, this is a company at the forefront of the research. Any move which is under explained is only bound to make things worse, fear sets in when risk is left to be hypothesized about. And this was a very big move. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-19, 23:51:54] ~ Mayank Gupta: Sorry I'm not sure about what. Just felt like this is an important policy take for an AI board. Happy to hear if there's something where I'm misguided. Or research more if you think something needs backing.

But just at the core of it, I've made 3 claim:
- AI can have risks
- OpenAI is leading the research
- Such boards should explain more than normal
Which of these do you think is not correct or needs more explanation?

[2023-11-19, 23:54:03] Ambika Computational Mama: As policy is taking a fore front in the AI space, we should be able to have more serious conversations here
[2023-11-19, 23:54:37] ~ Mayank Gupta: I thought it was exactly a policy question to discuss. Hence chose to write even after your messages. But no worries. Overload is bad for all such things
[2023-11-19, 23:55:14] Ambika Computational Mama: I liked your points, i just wanted to know more and not just a twitter link.
[2023-11-19, 23:55:40] ~ Mayank Gupta: I think my message was pretty serious. But maybe the actors are cast way too often. So a good movie about them also fell flat
[2023-11-19, 23:58:21] ~ Mayank Gupta: I just had one small thought. Any serious policy person left wondering - Did Ilya secretly discover AGI and thus had to take such a drastic move (or any such random thing) - is a fear not worth harbouring and something that the lack of open and detailed explanation by a board has caused following a serious action. That itself is not a good place to be in for us as a whole.

Hope this helps. I'll try to see if there is any other relevant example for this ‎<This message was edited>

And with fear, there will be theories and those who parade ways to fight it.
An open and accountable explanation would always be so much better

[2023-11-20, 00:25:10] ~ Naman Garg: It appears that we've reached level 2 already. An intriguing consideration, however, is whether humans are the appropriate benchmark for comparing AGI. It's possible that entities far more intelligent than humans exist. Therefore, is it accurate to define superintelligence solely in terms of surpassing human capabilities?
[2023-11-20, 00:25:37] ~ Naman Garg: Exactly
[2023-11-20, 00:35:55] ~ Khalid: What other entities?
[2023-11-20, 00:39:57] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Can we think of non human entities (maybe animals) which are better than humans in some dimension of intelligence?
[2023-11-20, 00:40:38] ~ Naman Garg: We're not fully aware of them as of now. It's possible that some animals may possess intelligence in ways we don't yet understand, which could be more advanced in certain aspects than human intelligence. Or, consider the classic sci-fi favorite: aliens, who might be far more advanced than us! 😂 And then there's the concept of collective intelligence, like a network of minds working together, which could surpass the overall intelligence of the human species. It's a fascinating topic with endless possibilities!
[2023-11-20, 00:40:41] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: ‎This message was deleted.
[2023-11-20, 00:43:04] ~ Khalid: Haha, yeah. Speaking on animals in very narrow terms they are more intelligent for sure (ex: neuronal density or reflexes etc.), but when you think of "general" intelligence you're really thinking about usefulness or solving different tasks relevant to humans, hence agi should be tied to humans ig.
[2023-11-20, 00:46:04] ~ Khalid: You can actually! Which is why the whole concept of AGI is kinda weird. The AI's performance will always be bounded by specific tasks which either an animal or human can do.
[2023-11-20, 00:48:01] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Human intelligence is bounded by evolution, but now we have a way to artificially generate intelligence. AI can actually evolve way faster now.
[2023-11-20, 00:48:22] ~ Khalid: Yeah, speed is really the main variable here
[2023-11-20, 00:48:36] ~ Khalid: And scale of experiments it can perform
[2023-11-20, 00:49:14] ~ Khalid: So AGI would be able to learn much faster than ASI? Does AGI require something fundamentally different from ASI?
[2023-11-20, 00:50:19] ~ Khalid: I meant the inverse :P
[2023-11-20, 00:52:08] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: If we think evolution purely as an experimentation game, it is very slow. It occurs on scale of 8 billion experiments (which are similar to each other) and the feedback is shared to the next generation in around 25 years.

Supercomputers with help of Intelligence (human or AI intelligence) can now conduct these experiments faster and can learn to evolve faster.
[2023-11-20, 00:53:05] ~ Naman Garg: Absolutely, you're spot on. When we talk about 'general intelligence', it's mostly about being able to do lots of different tasks, especially stuff that matters to us humans. But yeah, should we always compare everything to human smarts? Think about a bunch of minds all teamed up - they could probably outsmart any one person super easily. And hey, that group of minds might not even be humans.
[2023-11-20, 00:53:07] Prashant Singh JarApp: I can think of few  (1) emergent system like Ant hill , Flock of Birds  who travel across continent , Hive of Bees . They have an intelligence . it s distributed  , its ethireal but it exist . (2) A beever knows how to make a damn , tunnel even when its a feral beverr some species of birds like Baya Weaver  know how to make nest event when they are feral
[2023-11-20, 00:54:09] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: If we combine other form of life - maybe this experiment number can go to trillions.
[2023-11-20, 00:54:40] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Wow. A group can have 2^n experiments compared to isolated
[2023-11-20, 00:54:43] Prashant Singh JarApp: arrogance of human being is that we believe that our intelligence is "Natural" everything else is  Artificial . At best our intelligence is biological. , Computer has silicon based intelligence
[2023-11-20, 00:55:39] ~ Khalid: Agreed but we lack the data from that to train the models because those kind of intelligences are very different. Even humans lack an intuitive understanding of that.

My point is if we define this under the purview of ASI, it's impossible to get there with our current systems. It's not simply a compute/data issue now. The leap from level 2 to level 3/4/5 could well take a 100 years sadly
[2023-11-20, 00:55:41] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: I bet that next intelligence will come from bunch of AI systems coordinating with each other!
[2023-11-20, 00:57:19] Prashant Singh JarApp: Most humans are specist .. we think our intelligence and our consciousness is superior . It isn't all consciousness are same and should we treated same way valued same way . a specist is another abstraction on top of sexist , racist etc
[2023-11-20, 00:57:51] ~ Khalid: I'm biased 😂😂
[2023-11-20, 00:58:09] ~ Naman Garg: Agreed
[2023-11-20, 00:58:35] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: This is exactly what Larry said to Elon in ~2014~ 2013 and Elon started OpenAI 😅 Elon is specist. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-20, 00:59:38] ~ Naman Garg: Maybe deep learning/ Neural networks are not the right path towards AGI/ASI. We might have to explore combination of different fields
[2023-11-20, 00:59:47] Prashant Singh JarApp: We celebrated evolution as long as we were wining now that an AI can compete with us we are trying to be god and focusing on ID .  Wont work .
[2023-11-20, 00:59:59] ~ Khalid: ID?
[2023-11-20, 01:00:13] Prashant Singh JarApp: Intellegent Design
[2023-11-20, 01:02:28] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Similar to what Church thought of science, we might the same about robots. Whatever attacks the status quo is difficult to digest for humans :)
[2023-11-20, 01:02:30] Prashant Singh JarApp: When humanity moved from Aministic religion to Thiestic Religion we started treating animals as inferior to us and started domesticating them . AI will do the same to us . I am sure Initially Wolfs would have resited it but in few generation we have dogs who only find it natural that humans are their master . Ans we have some species who can't live without humans . AI will do same to us
[2023-11-20, 01:03:39] Prashant Singh JarApp: in few generations we might have a relation with machines like Humans have with dogs . and we wont notice .
[2023-11-20, 01:04:21] Prashant Singh JarApp: or we will become cyborgs ..either way change is unidirectional and any attempt to control is futile
[2023-11-20, 01:05:18] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Want to be on the side of e/acc so that machines would want to keep me :)
[2023-11-20, 01:05:35] ~ Khalid: I acknowledge that's a possibility but a distant one?
It's surely possible such a dynamic would exist but in such cases there would be some evil humans controlling the AI. 
Don't see anything fundamentally a part of AI as we know it today that would lead them to dominate us unprovoked. No emotions, no empathy, or no ego. (I'm referring to a coordinated attempt at subduing us. There would surely be a few exceptional freak accidents)
[2023-11-20, 01:06:10] ~ Khalid: There's no survival instinct in the models as we know em today
[2023-11-20, 01:06:19] ~ Khalid: Biological life does.
[2023-11-20, 01:06:36] ~ Khalid: All human endeavours are downstream of that
[2023-11-20, 01:07:24] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: There will be a new caste system maybe - pure machines, cyborgs, pure humans. And they would want their successors to follow what they are doing.
[2023-11-20, 01:07:25] ~ Khalid: Maybe codependence yeah, not like a master-pet dynamic
[2023-11-20, 01:07:38] Prashant Singh JarApp: :) Roko's basilisk
[2023-11-20, 01:07:42] ~ Khalid: ‎This message was deleted.
[2023-11-20, 01:08:35] ~ Khalid: Haha yeah
[2023-11-20, 01:08:37] Prashant Singh JarApp: i think Roko's basilisk is not how it will work . Our new overlords will be benovelent

[2023-11-20, 01:09:22] ~ Khalid: They would be indifferent. Benevolence is not a variable. 
Exactly!
[2023-11-20, 01:10:39] ~ Khalid: A more interesting question. Why does a human or any animal want to survive?
[2023-11-20, 01:11:03] ~ Khalid: Do we know of any animal species that doesn't really give a damn about whether they live or not? 😂
[2023-11-20, 01:11:05] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: That’s why alignment is necessary!! If GPTs kept getting trained on whatever text knowledge we have (which is a projection of humans) - AI might not care about each of us. That’s why Ilya created superalignment team 6 months ago!
[2023-11-20, 01:11:32] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Those who didn’t care - didn’t survive to get replicated.
[2023-11-20, 01:12:03] Harsh Gupta Felvin: ‎Harsh Gupta Felvin left
[2023-11-20, 01:12:28] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Evolution took care of people who don’t care about survival
[2023-11-20, 01:12:41] Prashant Singh JarApp: we are programmed for it
[2023-11-20, 01:14:36] ~ Khalid: We're too early to think about alignment. It's good in theory rn, but feel like we're dedicating too many mental cycles towards it this early. Get the models good enough first. The AI doom scenario is like 100 years away xD
[2023-11-20, 01:15:09] ~ Khalid: Needs to cross level 4/5
[2023-11-20, 01:16:01] ~ Khalid: It's important, but not urgent 🤷‍♂
[2023-11-20, 01:18:51] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: I was trying to read up all about Ilya yesterday - he is super worried about doomsday. All these things we discuss here - perhaps all this goes in his head 24x7. 
OpenAI original mission is to build AGI which benefits all humans. Perhaps Sam was focussing too much on building AGI while deprioritising the benefiting *all* humans.
Ilya and boards are human too - maybe this concern took over and they kicked him out :)
That’s why really want OpenAI to release official reasoning behind all this.
[2023-11-20, 01:18:59] Prashant Singh JarApp: Ilya created superalignment team. He coulnt align his co founder .
[2023-11-20, 01:19:28] Prashant Singh JarApp: Nimrod tried making tower of babel and failed
[2023-11-20, 01:20:00] Prashant Singh JarApp: Human like to fight inevitable instead of fighting their inertia
[2023-11-20, 01:23:16] Prashant Singh JarApp: i spent (wasted ? ) a big part of my youth thinking about the nature of consciousness .Computer science community is  stuborn in its reluctance to consider the possibility that Intellegence /Conciousness is substrate independent . Every other stream converge to that point
[2023-11-20, 01:24:22] Prashant Singh JarApp: If thats the case ( substrate independent Intelligence ) than AGI is not the final frontier .. just a steping stone
[2023-11-20, 01:24:32] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: His expertise lies in writing alignment code in language which *machine* can understand*. Still yet to develop expertise in human alignment😅
Human persuasion is one of the thing I want to learn. Might come handy sometime.

[2023-11-20, 01:28:33] Prashant Singh JarApp: Not really ..he is framing intgellegence as we frame brownian motion . I want to think of intelligence as an conscious entity on steering wheel
[2023-11-20, 01:31:33] Prashant Singh JarApp: Our brains are superbly energy eifficent and we don't know how to tap in to processing power . this always surprise me. I have a hunch that once Neuralink figure out the IO part it will go in to processing part and a new kind of computer will be made which is not based on Von Neuman Arch
[2023-11-20, 01:31:55] Prashant Singh JarApp: Jeff Hawkins have done some work on it
[2023-11-20, 01:35:29] Prashant Singh JarApp: Another thing which is surprisingly missing  from this AI debate is no one is asking Govt to subsidised the cost of tech dev .
[2023-11-20, 01:35:53] Prashant Singh JarApp: Internet was possible because DARPA subsidised the cost 
GPS because Defence Deptt wanted precise targeting on bomb
[2023-11-20, 01:35:54] Prashant Singh JarApp: Telecom by spectrum auction . 
UPI again Govt
[2023-11-20, 01:35:55] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Maybe AGI final frontier is to figure how to run advanced AI model in a machine of size of humans which can charge in 10 minutes and go on for hours :)
Perhaps need to do lot of 80-20 here in terms of what is important and what is not.
[2023-11-20, 01:36:03] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Long road ahead!
[2023-11-20, 01:36:39] Prashant Singh JarApp: mushkill hai
[2023-11-20, 01:37:25] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: GPT4 bhi mushkil hi tha!
[2023-11-20, 01:37:38] Prashant Singh JarApp: We dont have a acess to memory ..every thing we see , hear,  experience  is store in our head but not available for IO .
[2023-11-20, 01:38:13] Prashant Singh JarApp: Von Neuman Arch and IO based systems are hitting the limit IMHO
[2023-11-20, 01:38:34] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: As you said - more we figure how humans systems work via neuralinl - we might be able to reverse engineer. I don’t know much! Need to read up more!
[2023-11-20, 01:39:11] Prashant Singh JarApp: counting on Elon to do that . I volunteered for beta testing they rejected
[2023-11-20, 01:39:40] Prashant Singh JarApp: bloddy regulations
[2023-11-20, 01:40:17] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: For profit orgs which take long term view are sort of doing this work.
[2023-11-20, 01:41:00] Prashant Singh JarApp: and becoming gate keeper ? imagine HTTP / SMTP were privately owned
[2023-11-20, 01:42:46] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Early days. Patents were also similar to gatekeeping but things eventually get democratised.
[2023-11-20, 01:43:44] Prashant Singh JarApp: For profit walo ka hamesha nuksaan hota hai ..Xeroxe invented much of PC but lost on PC , MS invented Ajax and lost on rich web apps , Google invented the paper on Attention is all you need but Open AI capitalized it
[2023-11-20, 01:44:25] ~ Naman Garg: A new paper from Google Research just provided evidence that transformers (such as LLMs) cannot generalize beyond their training data. (https://arxiv.org/abs/2311.00871)

So maybe transformers are not a way to go forward with. And other approach might not be that compute and data hungry.
[2023-11-20, 01:46:48] Prashant Singh JarApp: ye dekha maine .. thoda ticky hai .... if there is an underlying pattern in data which spread beyond the training set than it can extrapolate . No ?
[2023-11-20, 01:47:58] Prashant Singh JarApp: Those of us who have read the sherlock home story "Adenture of Dancing Man " can relate
[2023-11-20, 01:47:59] Prashant Singh JarApp: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Adventure_of_the_Dancing_Men?useskin=vector
[2023-11-20, 01:48:24] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: But there are also many different technologies which they developed and used which helped them take over the world. Google figured PageRank, Xerox perhaps ability to copy and MS on windows. 
It is a hit/miss thing - of all things they invent - sometimes they are able to make money out of it - sometimes some other orgs. Eventually everyone wins.
[2023-11-20, 01:48:46] Prashant Singh JarApp: Question is can A LLM break the code and translate the message the way Sherleck homes did
[2023-11-20, 01:49:58] ~ Naman Garg: Yes and no. Not sure
[2023-11-20, 01:51:59] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Lot of things for me to read up :) Thanks!
I will go off to sleep. This was my first lengthy interaction on this group - liked it :)

[2023-11-20, 08:21:23] Nirant K: We want this to be a more open, focussed on Policy & Philosophy forum. If you've experience on the job or otherwise in these domains, we'd love to have you as a moderator here. 

So far, we'd avoided moderating this forum e.g. removals/bans. Going forward, we'll be actively moderating this — this includes, removing folks from the community (not just the group), pausing the group to Admin can post only temporarily and others ways. 

Specifically for random banter e.g. current affairs, we've a random banter group which is open to everyone here: 
https://chat.whatsapp.com/H9QMoo9nNXF9ckJ7jEJ98J
[2023-11-20, 08:22:23] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: ^+💯
[2023-11-20, 08:25:13] Prashant Singh JarApp: I'm curious why there is such a need to police the content here. This is a group for policy and philosophy discussion.. policy by definition is a framework for accommodating viewpoints and viewpoints first show up as random observation and yes gossip. Observation -hypothesis -theory. Same goes for philosophy where we try to build a moral, ethical or epistemological viewon some phenomenon. Sometime moderation looks like enforcement of personal preferences at best and attempt to manufacture consent at worst
[2023-11-20, 08:28:39] Nirant K: Our moderation has always been around how you say something and NOT what you say. So the "Observation -hypothesis -theory" idea remains intact. Everything from nihilism to x-risk is fair game.

Less about manufacturing consent, and more around avoiding the "loudest voice wins"

[2023-11-20, 08:30:37] Ambika Computational Mama: Two reasons: 
1. Because some folk felt it appropriate to mansplain and insult two other active users because their opinion on something differed
2. Why should this be a twitter dump
[2023-11-20, 08:31:17] Ambika Computational Mama: On point 2, by making it a twitter dump you are negating unsiloed holistic conversations. Which the group is capable of
[2023-11-20, 08:31:59] Ravi Srinivasan: I'm just happy with the solution of a watercooler group. Hope all the interesting conv shifts there
[2023-11-20, 08:32:06] Ambika Computational Mama: Some of us are not interested in showcasing how much time we spend on twitter but rather having critical conversations about AI, Phil and policy
[2023-11-20, 08:34:31] Ambika Computational Mama: And sorry I missed the last few points. There can be post human, post anthropological, feminist, ecological, care and many other view points and occasionally we accept that twitter is philosophical (while it is certainly not a false notion) it’s not the only truth.
[2023-11-20, 08:38:44] Prashant Singh JarApp: 🙏 thank you for being so accommodating champion of freedom of expression

What we'd like to avoid is current affairs, e.g. Twitter or other firehose of OpenAI news here.
[2023-11-20, 09:33:10] Nirant K: Critical thinking including discussions on x-risk, and ideas from that via Twitter are welcome.  E.g. Yudkowsky-ian ideas, which I personally disagree with. I'll defend the ideas I disagree with as well. 
[2023-11-20, 09:34:23] Nirant K: The only request would be to add a line or two of why you think a link (Twitter or otherwise) is interesting to you, that'd allow us to mentally decide if something is interesting and engage in the topic directly instead of the link being the anchor of the conversation
[2023-11-20, 09:35:15] Nirant K: This'd also allow you to share if something is interesting, and you might not fully understand or agree with e.g. most things in ethics or moral studies for me. And preface/lag with a question

Missed this one in the middle of all these discussions.
[2023-11-21, 16:26:07] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: It is going to be an important ethical question of raising capital from the Gulf sovereign funds for AI, if the funds come with some kind of pressure to censor AI based on their laws.
[2023-11-21, 16:29:21] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: But its for manufacturing and chip R&D only right? Not exactly model training directly
[2023-11-21, 16:30:31] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yeah, Chip should be fine. I'm just raising overall concern for AI.
[2023-11-21, 16:31:45] ~ Arvind Sankar: On what terms though? I doubt anyone would say "take my money" without anything in return
[2023-11-21, 16:33:33] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Arabs haha. They'll throw money at anything trendy and fancy lol
[2023-11-21, 16:35:47] Nirant K: What if the chip itself has backdoors? Like the Chinese Wifi routers?
[2023-11-21, 16:40:48] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Assuming the chips are "Designed in California, Baked in Dubai". Also, I would say Dubai and Saudi are just interested in the diversification of their capital more than these issues. While they both have state power, China has to keep its population under control, so backdoors/spyware are important for them.
[2023-11-21, 17:33:48] ~ Abhik: As far as I know chip manufacturing is a very water intensive process.
In middle East I don't know how it will pan out
[2023-11-21, 17:59:07] Bharat Kumar Ramesh Hashmal Web3: Ah, but Soverign wealth funds are LPs behind nearly every major venture capital fund. It's almost a pilgrimage for most GPs to go to Abu Dhabi, Doha and Riyadh.

[2023-11-21, 19:35:41] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Would just add that Dubai and UAE will figure out the water issue. Their might and will to build is unmatched.
[2023-11-21, 19:36:25] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: Their might (oil) and will to build (with slave labor) is indeed unmatched

[2023-11-21, 19:38:44] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: So the desert may not be the best place to build fabs
[2023-11-21, 19:39:15] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: But oil money gonna oil money 🤷🏾‍♂️
[2023-11-21, 19:39:30] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Agreed. I am more speaking from  their opportunistic initiatives not just in physical buildings but other domains as well.

[2023-11-22, 01:43:58] ~ Naman Garg: Philosophy: Hey, so I was thinking, what if we use reinforcement learning to optimize the loss function and find the minima, instead of the usual gradient descent? I mean, RL is already good at optimizing paths, right? Not sure if anyone's tried this before. Would be cool to hear what you think about this idea!
[2023-11-22, 01:46:14] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Think you can google this, because I have a feeling this has been experimented
[2023-11-22, 04:13:16] Sachin Legaltech: The way we usually use RL is for designing objective functions and then let the backprop calculate gradients.   We can use RL for training a meta trainer where state would be current weights, actions would be proposed gradients and rewards would be change in loss after the gradient update. Just this would be really hard to train with RL. RL policy would have to indirectly learn how to calculate gradients. But if we want to explore gradient-free learning (or search) , evolutionary strategies can work well provided we have large number of machines for doing parallel search. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-22, 10:11:05] Kashyap Kompella: *Decoding Intentions: Artificial Intelligence and Costly Signals*

This research paper on AI policy, co-authored by OpenAI board member Helen Turner, is a bit esoteric, but is one of the issues that caused a rift among their board members.  Sam Altman felt that the paper criticized OpenAI while praising Anthropic’s approach.

- Meta will be coming up with more community efforts esp to solve for LLama2 adoption and feedback
- Meta is not inherently incentivized to give compute to startups(which was a recurring ask)
- They are keen to develop the India ecosystem esp with support for more Indic data in their LLMs
- Didn’t confirm on Llama3 being multi-modal but gave a fair hint it will be 😂
- They do a fair bit of screening before releasing LLama2 around hate speech, racial stuff. Which is the reason they have most of the other models(NLLB/Seamless4MT) in CC-NC license

[2023-12-05, 09:16:17] Subbu Rama: Interesting post and analogy. 

I think the huge missing part in AI (that’s now being worked on) is system 2 thinking (bringing reasoning beyond just being a parrot who just repeats). That will be critical to advance further in AGI imo. 

This may also help in getting some of the policy issues, through teaching and reasoning with the system , just like humans do as we grow from toddlers to adults.

As for reasoning, large language models (70b and above) are much better in reasoning and there seems to be decent work coming out every week which pushes the boundaries a bit but still way behind. Some good tidbits below on that

[2023-12-05, 10:30:40] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Practically speaking, and not an attempt at a joke, people have made it big selling toilet paper, which is arguably simpler than RAG even. So I see no reason why they can't get big. 

A lot is just the team and execution I feel.
[2023-12-05, 10:30:57] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: And marketing, let's never write off marketing
[2023-12-05, 10:40:02] Jay Pokarna 2014 BPCC: This was the company behind the truthgpt by whole foods. We also talked to them for a usecase, but then didn't move forward with them
[2023-12-05, 14:39:57] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: There’s a recent joke forgot the source..

“Seems like most of the money in GenAI is made by front end devs while ML /AI engineers seethe in their Colab notebooks”🥲

Since RAG is almost like Hello World for GenAI use case
[2023-12-05, 14:54:48] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Curious why not ? Did u feel u wanted to build it yourself...or something lacking
[2023-12-05, 15:48:41] Jay Pokarna 2014 BPCC: We thought we could build it ourselves. Plus, their whole usp is that they use both claude and gpt and also they use publically available data of competitors and your own data. These things weren't important for us, hence we didn't go ahead
[2023-12-05, 22:08:27] ~ Paddy: Yes. It's about execution. If you can use your limited knowledge to solve some real problem, ppl will use it and pay for it. 
Of course, a great executor will use the assistance of experts like many in this group. 

Also, It's not that much about marketing but more about solving a user's problem.
[2023-12-05, 22:10:36] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Agreed. At the end good marketing and sales is about problem solving as well. Didn't mean to portray marketing as bad.

[2023-12-06, 20:54:56] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: When evaluated on the same platform as the original AlphaCode, AlphaCode 2 shows massive improvements, solving nearly twice as many problems, and we estimate that it performs better than 85% of competition participants — up from nearly 50% for AlphaCode. When programmers collaborate with AlphaCode 2 by defining certain properties for the code samples to follow, it performs even better.

[2023-12-08, 10:37:37] Kesava Reddy: A recent event had a talk on AI and Cloud policies around the world. The discussion included important new developments in the European Union, the US, and India, as well as the bigger picture of global data control and some new policies that will affect it. Quick Notes


1. India’s Stance on AI & Cloud:
    1. Evolution of Digital India Act: The Digital India Act is evolving over the IT Act of 2000, the same is in its drafting stage, signaling a shift in India's approach to regulating AI. 
    2. Guidelines over Strict Implementation: India is likely to adopt guidelines rather than strict implementation for AI development. This approach aligns with the need for flexibility in adapting to evolving regulatory frameworks.
    3. Cloud Regulation Challenges: Challenges in cloud regulation, particularly the lack of clear distinctions between Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS), Platform as a Service (PAAS), and Software as a Service (SAAS), highlight potential hurdles for our cloud-based services in the Indian market.Singapore is soon to release a policy segregating each service, it will be crucial to track the same.
    4. TRAI's Control Attempt: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) proposed consolidating control over cloud and telecom policies under a single regulatory body, suggesting the integration of cloud policies under the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). However, this proposal was rejected, and the response indicated that the regulation of cloud services would remain under the purview of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).
    5. Meity Secretary: The MeitY Secretary is closely overseeing the forthcoming policies, with a specific focus on those being introduced by Asian countries. This is noteworthy as our Digital India Act is anticipated to encompass a combination of these policies.


2. US Executive Order on AI:
    1. Transparency and Safety: The U.S. is moving towards increased transparency from AI companies, reflecting a global trend. Developers are encouraged to share safety test results to assess the risks associated with their technology, highlighting the importance of responsible AI development.
    2. Adaptive Policy: The policy remains adaptive and flexible, indicating that the regulatory landscape is still evolving.

3. EU AI Policy:
    1. Final Chapter Pending: The EU AI policy is in its final stages, with a proposed motion expected at the end of this week. 
    2. Resistance from Key EU Members: France, Italy, and Germany, the initial contributors to the policy's formulation, are currently opposing certain elements of the policy. They are championing self-regulation in order to safeguard and foster their AI entities like Mistral Ai and Aleph Alpha, while also aiming to prevent potential dominance by U.S. entities in the AI ecosystem.
    3. Focus on Human Rights: The policy places a strong emphasis on human rights considerations, aligning with the growing global awareness of ethical AI practices. 
    4. GDPR Update: An update to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 2018 is anticipated, emphasising limited retention periods for personal data. This aligns with the broader trend of heightened data protection measures globally.
    5. Liability and Accountability Frameworks: AI policies likely to emphasize the importance of human oversight and control, especially in critical applications. Users may be granted the right to comprehend when AI-driven decisions are made and possess the ability to intervene or appeal such decisions. Additionally, developers will typically be mandated to establish transparent liability and accountability frameworks, delineating responsibilities and potential repercussions in the event of system failures or adverse consequences. These measures aim to ensure ethical AI practices, user empowerment, and accountability throughout the development and deployment lifecycle.


4. Suggestion over Glocalizing Data for AI:

1. Free Migration of Data: The proposition advocating for the unrestricted movement of data across borders signals a significant paradigm shift in data governance. This perspective acknowledges the increasing significance of seamless data flow in global AI strategies. 
2. Enforcement and Policing: A debate on policing of data was carried with a conclusion that the counsel to enforce and police data should be done selectively and only when necessary furthering a pragmatic and nuanced approach to data governance. Rather than imposing rigid regulations universally, this recommendation suggests tailoring enforcement measures based on specific contextual needs. This approach strikes a balance between ensuring data security and facilitating innovation in the AI landscape. It allows for flexibility in adapting to diverse regulatory environments while addressing concerns related to privacy, security, and ethical use of data.
3. Geofencing of Data: The discussion pertained that geofencing of data adds an additional layer of consideration. Geofencing involves establishing virtual perimeters around geographical areas, regulating data based on location. Incorporating geofencing aligns with the idea of selective enforcement, where data governance measures can be tailored according to specific geographic regions in order to comply with specific domestic privacy laws within a state or country.

5. NIST Framework on AI & Cloud: It was suggested to monitor the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework for AI & cloud-based policy, given its scientific approach to policy drafting. Similar elements have been incorporated in the executive order on AI by the U.S. and the same is referred to for any amendments.

"So when will we start asking the AI what it wants rather than constantly  trying to impose on the AI what we want? 

Perhaps the path to alignment and beyond is asking the Superintelligence how we can align with them and not the other way around ?"

[2023-12-16, 20:45:22] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: Lol wut
[2023-12-16, 20:45:38] Prashant Singh JarApp: Every morning I take uber to my office . During my commute I talk to my family / Friend  . Its usually a 15-20 min ride and I use AirPods while talking . When I reach destination I get down put my AirPods in case , Put bag on desk and go for coffee .
[2023-12-16, 20:45:48] Prashant Singh JarApp: Nothing was out of ordinary On that weird morning . I was talking to my friend when I reached office . I got down, Said bye , Cut the call  and reached out for AirPods . I was shocked to find that I was not wearing them . I remembered putting them on charging before booking uber and never picking them up .
[2023-12-16, 20:46:02] Prashant Singh JarApp: Still all the while I felt that I was talking with AirPods . Uber driver told me pick up point , I saw a little YT Clip ,  My friend spoke to me , 
All seemed like whispering right in my ears .
[2023-12-16, 20:46:36] Prashant Singh JarApp: The moment I registered  that pods are missing I   started noticing the ambient noise toward which I  was oblivious so far

[2023-12-16, 20:48:55] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: I think it's something to do with how used we are to having the airpods in our ears all the time

[2023-12-16, 21:03:36] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yes, that exact example is more of pareidolia, but I mean it could have been followed by the first glimpse of wandering about what things can be or some thoughts of planning/future running in the chimp brain before that

Most llm evals have this problem of data leakage where the eval set leaks into the training set.

What if we had a black box eval that had encrypted data, that is never revealed to the public. 

It's a binary that spits out a score and performs the eval in an obfuscated / encrypted way.

What do you folks think ?

Should I build something like this and opensource it ?

[2023-12-17, 15:10:37] Vamshi: Somewhat less vulnerable opinion, but I think that the real magic in the universe will always be hidden in plain sight.
[2023-12-17, 15:11:39] Vamshi: There won’t be “glitches”, that are noticeable. Rather, we will be forced to rationalise all the magical occurrences by being forced to adopt epistemological fallacies.
[2023-12-17, 15:17:41] Vamshi: Not actually sure about the various accepted viewpoints philosophy wise here, would be fun to hear from others.

The idea of randomness is itself a rationalisation of magic.

Likewise, the idea of a sampling or a measurement is a rationalisation of the idea of an agency that transcends the manifest ( or the defined ).
[2023-12-17, 15:33:29] Vamshi: And personal significance is the enabler that allows magic to be hidden in plain sight

[2023-12-17, 18:36:52] Vamshi: A personal metaphor I use for the framework that subsumes explanations, is the idea of an “interactive explanation”.

The interactive explanation has no objective reality, because that’s the very idea that it subsumes.

In order to experience an interactive explanation, an agent must interact with the explanation and the resulting experience co-creates this new type of understanding.

[2023-12-17, 18:49:09] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yup ➿
[2023-12-17, 18:50:51] Vamshi: If there’s no free will, then essentially the universe can discover, and mathematics and science can “do themselves”, and the universe can “write down the double helix into printed books”, “on its own”, and discover protein folding using deep learning and alter the course of evolution and do intelligent design effectively, no?
[2023-12-17, 18:52:09] Vamshi: Of course you can say none of it really “happened” because it’s just a random possibility that unfolded in a really “lucky” universe, but lucky for “who” ?
[2023-12-17, 18:52:38] Vamshi: With no one for whom there is a personal significance, all magic is hidden in plain sight.

[2023-12-17, 20:30:57] Vamshi: Not sure if I fully understood, but there is generally a larger consensus for an intuitive understanding of intelligence that has to do with complexity.

But there is very little consensus for even an intuitive understanding of consciousness beyond the single point of the graph that you can extrapolate from, which is yourself.

We generally accord new born babies with the same level of consciousness as fully grown adults, even though they exhibit a much smaller intelligence.
[2023-12-17, 20:31:54] Vamshi: So even our human bias is very complicated and inconsistent
[2023-12-17, 20:32:20] Vamshi: Something I’ve posted here a long while ago, which is a very interesting bridge between ideas

[2023-12-17, 20:35:59] Vamshi: Also, just to clarify my general stance, I avoid the religious forks on the discussion, purely because there’s a lot of ancient stuff in there which doesn’t tie back to the current debates.

I find all the Indian and other religious philosophy extremely interesting and insightful on a personal level. 

I just feel it doesn’t lend itself to useful conversations in a tech heavy group. It’s too far out.

There's increasingly low controversy that sapience (ability to reason, have a world model) does or will exist in machines.

However there's much controversy whether machines will be conscious (self aware). Or sentient (can feel stuff). ‎<This message was edited>

But sapience and sentience will be important and very practical. In 10 years machine ethics will be a serious, practical, relatively popular field
[2023-12-17, 20:57:23] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Can you really be conscious without a body ?


Feels like an embodiment problem to me
[2023-12-17, 21:00:04] Vamshi: There was a joke recently in one of the groups that’s half serious, related to intersection of AI applied to molecular biology
[2023-12-17, 21:00:52] Vamshi: The idea that intelligence can “jump” into embodied consciousness, via “designed mutations”.
[2023-12-17, 21:03:21] Vamshi: Whatever that means 😄
[2023-12-17, 21:03:58] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Is sentience different than consciousness?
[2023-12-17, 21:04:24] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Ah. Nice. Don't have an answer yet. But definitely the right question. 🫡
[2023-12-17, 21:07:59] Ankur Pandey: The way it's defined, it's a subset of consciousness. The ability to feel (pain, pleasure, emotions). Be happy, get hurt - that kind of stuff.
[2023-12-17, 21:08:45] Ankur Pandey: Chickens - for example - are demonstrably sentient. It's unclear whether they are conscious and highly unlikely that they are sapient.

[2023-12-17, 21:16:39] Prashant Singh JarApp: Both are same as far as nature are concerned. Before the rise of theistic religions we were animistic ppl and used to consider them same
[2023-12-17, 21:37:07] Ankur Pandey: Just noticed this. I also loved another video (debate) by same author on Theories Of Everything with Curt Jaimungal

[2023-12-17, 21:37:55] Ankur Pandey: In general ToE with Curt podcast is like Lex - but imho more in depth, visceral, even intellectually confrontational. If Lex is Shahrukh Khan, Curt is like Irrfan Khan.

I feel like so much of what Lee Cronin says is on such thin ice, but there’s one idea in there which, for me, was personally the most insightful to intuit some direction where the solution to the jump from the realm of the epistemological (or models and explanations) to the realm of the phenomenological (feeling and being) might emerge, and that is the idea that life, sentience and consciousness might be the ultimate optimisation of information that uses all of physics.

A definition of biological or non biological life, that leverages the most energy efficient optimisation of information that uses all of the dynamics of the underlying physics, both known and unknown to us.

This sort of expands or redefines the notion of a computation to the entire available machinery of the universe, so it’s not the same idea of “computation” as we currently, formally, define it, but something new. A new class of computation beyond Turing.

This also resonates with my favourite quote from quantum theory, which is generally attributed to Norbert Wiener, which goes something like “The best material model of a cat is another, or preferably the same cat”. 

The ability to “perfectly” recreate a piece of matter, conscious or not, seems closely related to the process of creating life itself.

A model must essentially lose essential information, and this is acceptable in a pragmatic sense, but unacceptable in a universal sense.

The idea that there exists certain information for which there is “no model at all”, is the counter intuitive, but strangely satisfying explanation …
[2023-12-18, 22:11:20] Vamshi: This also ties back to the idea of magic hidden in plain sight. Because when you are operating at the level of the entire universe, there’s nowhere to hide.

On the other hand, there’s no one to hide it from!
[2023-12-19, 00:30:23] Ankur Pandey: Yes that whole thing (Assembly Theory AFAIR) was intriguing. Although Lee Cronin used less precise language compared to a mathematician / physicist.

[2023-12-22, 14:51:12] ~ Arvind Sankar: Just to provide some more context in this case, these patent applications were part of parallel applications filed in many countries by the "Artificial Inventor Project". Essentially they have filed patent applications listing DABUS (an AI) as the inventor, and Stephen Thaler (the owner of DABUS) as the owner/patent holder. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-12-22, 14:53:11] ~ Arvind Sankar: To my knowledge, so far only South Africa has allowed their patent applications to be granted. Australia came close, but the decision was overturned by higher courts. In all other countries, the patent applications were rejected on similar lines, viz. AI was not intended to be included under definition of "Inventor" in corresponding statutes, and that Stephen Thaler cannot be the owner of the patent by virtue of creating/owning/operating the AI.

[2023-12-22, 15:46:53] ~ Arvind Sankar: Well, legal precedents are not policy. Most of these rejections are more formal and substantive. Legislatures can always make new laws/policies based on whether granting IP to AI generated inventions/works would promote innovation or not
[2023-12-22, 15:47:11] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Fair.

[2023-12-22, 15:48:03] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Will they though? EU especially seems highly unlikely to be one the first to advocate for replacement of humans. And not Enablement.

[2023-12-22, 23:13:58] Prashant Singh JarApp: Google's position was : this is not a new thing I can go street by street and read name . tech is only allowing to do same thing quickly . if you want to have privacy don't put name plate on door for everyone tosee

[2023-12-23, 07:49:11] ~ Arvind Sankar: I think they should be allowed as they provide an incentive to bring knowledge to public.

An interesting read about a BCG experiment on the use of AI by Business Consultants.
[2023-12-29, 14:30:30] ~ Rachna M: Khosla, is making a relevant point, even though we’re seeing inflation now, in the medium to long run there’s a possibility of deflation because AI and Automation will reduce the cost of production. Such deflation may actually be good for the economy as costs will decline and not business profit margins measured in %. 

However, this business insider article is not well thought out and not well written, as they didn’t quite understand the Macroeconomic cause that will lead to decline in prices with the use of AI and are just using a generic definition of deflation to draw negative conclusions.
[2023-12-29, 15:21:11] ~ Kaustubh: I do not agree with the logic that the cost of production will determine the price of a product. Raw material prices usually increase every year. Even if the cost of production reduces, companies won't take a hit on their margins.
[2023-12-29, 15:25:56] Kunal Bhatia Hexo: If cost of production goes down, competition will drive prices down
[2023-12-29, 15:27:14] ~ Kaustubh: Yes there is a possibility but, that reduction has to be significant enough to take the decision of reducing prices.
[2023-12-29, 15:28:07] ~ Arvind Sankar: AI would also increase supply

[2024-01-14, 09:17:38] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Yes team reduction is a given but what does “content” relevance even mean if everyone is using same tools.

See what has happened to “blogs”, we know that same is coming to TikTok and UGC in 6 months.does that mean we switch off the content like as baseline is everyone is generating “content”? Or does that mean new business models. Making an automated content marketing agent is 1st degree derivative. What are some 2nd order stuff community has heard of?

For example: Digital rights management (any influencer or human like me can license my image / digital avatar for brands to use legally).

Couldn't hold myself back from sharing this. A major vibe shift, indeed 😆
[2024-01-14, 21:44:39] ~ Anjineyulu: I had a thought regarding ondc,ondc's objective is to serve kirana stores but online bussiness is a concept which operates at scale and profits from it.For being democratic is not government defeating the purpose of technology, this platform will eventually increase price,decrease saving and eventually citizens will be disappointed
[2024-01-14, 21:49:14] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: ONDC's purpose is more generic, not just oriented towards Kirana Stores, it is much broader than that.

 How it plays out has to be seen for many participants though. There are many levels of ondc participants - their website illustrates this in detail with good documentation.
[2024-01-14, 21:54:29] ~ Anjineyulu: Yeah but atleast kirana stores may not succeed right?I am sure people like nandan will have a plan. But don't know what's that.I felt selling data like nielsen and give incentive to kirana stores
[2024-01-14, 21:56:43] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Time will tell how it all plays out. there are lot of nuances more deeper than this. it is all about how businesses orient around these and also about reducing monopoly to powerful online retailers/ecommerce platforms etc.
[2024-01-14, 22:00:43] ~ Anjineyulu: Yeah but this seems like a great problem,then  democracies can never work at scale or huge innovation involving all citizens has to happen for everyone to be happy
[2024-01-14, 22:23:24] ~ Rachna M: I think if it can be effective in reducing the monopoly/oligopoly power of the few big online retailers that in itself will be a worthwhile accomplishment.
[2024-01-14, 22:25:46] ~ Anjineyulu: Won't good regulations of competitive commission of India would suffice,would this platform be required?

[2024-01-14, 22:36:27] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: I agree with this take somewhat 
Being a marketplace allows you to tailor demand and supply really well 
This does create good consumer and supplier surplus 

ONDC has fragmented the demand supply matchmaking
The customer experience takes a hit because of this 

Case in point 
You order from Pincode buyer app on ONDC
It is fulfilled by a seller who was onboarded via magicpin seller app 
It is fulfilled by a logistics provider like Shadowfax who is a network participant as logistics service provider

The payment is fulfilled by PhonePe who is also a network participant as payment provider 

If anything goes wrong at any step there’s no central ops which will solve the issue 

Because each step has its own service provider each will charge its own commission which can drive up the prices instead 

Speaking as someone who has extensively worked on ONDC and in marketplace app for logistics
[2024-01-14, 22:39:28] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Still these are early days 
And I see more promising applications of ONDC in B2B and in govt contracts tender/proposal implementation 

It’s really making  marketplaces of suppliers sweat a lot
Since the aggregation of suppliers is the core USP for such companies.
[2024-01-14, 22:45:59] ~ Anjineyulu: But I feel,if one kirana stores has a authentic item the platform can help it scale,Raise funds to Expand,give food engineers to validate,rather than a startup raising,giving name and burning marketing dollars to attain a position.
[2024-01-14, 22:46:43] ~ Anjineyulu: So eventually does it push innovation of local shops 😇
[2024-01-14, 22:48:30] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: It’s a protocol
Not a platform like Amazon /FK 
Innovation will be driven by apps which helps users participate on the network 

Which will be startups themselves
[2024-01-14, 22:53:48] ~ Anjineyulu: But will not govt pivot to this way,I wish there should be Entrepreneurs,but to claim ownership of ideas we will have to burn money on marketing and operations,which eventually expands it's respective research budget.I feel doing this way I suggested can bring down these costs and plough it back to say medical research and essentials.Any idea if govt thinks like this?
[2024-01-14, 22:56:03] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Govt still burns money on UPI
Every year the budget provisions around 4000cr for UPI network if I’m not mistaken 
That’s why we have no fee for UPI transactions 
This increases the participation 
But also you have high prevalence of fraud in UPI ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-14, 22:56:47] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: UPI is a protocol 
Innovation is by apps like PhonePe,GPay,PayTm
[2024-01-14, 22:58:09] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Primarily these have highest UPI Tx share
NPCI also drives innovation in usage of protocol like credit lines on UPI 

But user adoption is driven by these apps
[2024-01-14, 23:04:37] ~ Anjineyulu: Understood...I felt a cap on no of Entrepreneurs may be required because of ownership cost associated  ,thus a blockchain network which verifies capabilities of startups on ondc may help  startups also bring down costs.A verified leader board may help.

Like if u see for bard, google has to spend a lot on benchmarking,and now for gpt5 again openai will have to spend on benchmarking.At the end we are eventually reducing money received by humans and letting the servers burn
[2024-01-14, 23:06:25] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Namma yaatri uses ondc and has hit it big time in Bangalore. Spreading to many cities
[2024-01-14, 23:06:59] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: No market has prospered where there were artificial caps on entrepreneurship and capitalism 

We have ample examples in history to prove that 

“Verifying capability on blockchain” sounds good on paper only tbh 

Capital allocation which spent on money being burned was by product of ZIRP era

Capitalist markets are self correcting 

When interest rates are going higher capital is being allocated more efficiently
[2024-01-14, 23:07:12] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: So there's some usecases apps on ondc protocol that are definitely very useful
[2024-01-14, 23:08:59] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Yeah I have high doubts around that 
They are onboarding customers and suppliers too 

They are also dictating how each supplier gets a demand if you look at their allocation logic 
NM is behaving more like marketplace than Network participant 

Only that it’s not charging commission but subscription 

A true test of NM being in ONDV is if I start a auto app on ONDC in Bangalore I should be able to book autos onboarded by NM
[2024-01-14, 23:09:41] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: They are compliant with ONDC and Beckn protocol
I’ve gone through their GitHub 

But my last point still stands
[2024-01-14, 23:09:55] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yes valid points
[2024-01-15, 08:47:32] Hari Balasubramanian: Most Banks , Financial institutions , FMCG companies have started onboarding ONDC into their app to serve their customers. Financing transactions , logistics , grievance management and ratings of service providers will go a long way in ensuring that some sectors will use platforms that use ONDC protocol as their preferred channel . 
The inflection point will come in a few years . Still early days - but looks to be disruptive.

Large language models (LLMs), exemplified by ChatGPT, have gained considerable attention for their excellent natural language processing capabilities. Nonetheless, these LLMs present many challenges, particularly in the realm of trustworthiness. Therefore, ensuring the trustworthiness of LLMs emerges as an important topic. This paper introduces TRUSTLLM, a comprehensive study of trustworthiness in LLMs, including principles for different dimensions of trustworthiness, established benchmark, evaluation, and analysis of trustworthiness for mainstream LLMs, and discussion of open challenges and future directions. Specifically, we first propose a set of principles for trustworthy LLMs that span eight different dimensions.

[2024-01-24, 22:25:53] Bhagyashree AI Lawyer: Hello! 

I’m Bhagyashree, a tech lawyer by profession and have worked in privacy (12 years) and AI for 8 years. 

I am now the co-founder of Compliant AI (www.CompliantAI.org), a Switzerland-based AI and algorithmic audit service provider. 

Looking forward to more exchanges here!
[2024-01-24, 22:32:19] ~ pajama poets: Forgive me for barging in with questions but I've never met a tech lawyer
I'm studying law at the moment. I was wondering what are the Indian laws around AI and what are the international laws we have ratified that can be applied to AI

If you could direct me to YouTube videos or any articles, would truly appreciate it


Also, forgive me for this anxiety
You know how international space law puts restrictions on govt and how they can't declare sovereignity in space but hardly any restrictions on private entities which in future will be a big disaster?
Do you think what is happening with space law will happen with AI law? Will we end up developing laws when it's too late? ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-24, 22:39:13] Bhagyashree AI Lawyer: The beauty of tech law is that it’s borderless! 

There are no Indian laws specifically for AI - but the existing laws can clearly apply. 

As for international laws in AI, I would like if you search on these on its own - there are 3 countries that have brought out laws and a union that will bring forth an Act and it would be a good exercise (and also legal research training) to find them and read :)

Plenty of articles on LinkedIn, AI journals, IAPP website etc that you can read. 

No, AI won’t end up like space laws - it will be regulated and we may soon see that such tight restrictions won’t work. The fragmentation of govt approaches towards AI regulation will make certain countries more desirable for AI companies and some missing out. Honestly, to early to predict what will happen next, many are cheering for AGI, so may be AI is a passing phase :)

[2024-01-31, 12:25:51] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: We made kannada llama but fun fact I can't even read kannada
[2024-01-31, 12:26:16] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: @917892792975 there will be many for sure, check google etc they are investing in multi-lingual heavily

[2024-01-31, 12:26:30] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: (1) Monterey incentive is low for Indic languages
[2024-01-31, 12:26:35] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Something like this😂
[2024-01-31, 12:26:47] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: hope you dont learn from that llm bro :D
[2024-01-31, 12:27:12] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: no llms will get semantics perfectly still or decipher meaning, not even gpt4 :D
[2024-01-31, 12:27:21] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yeah exactly.
[2024-01-31, 12:30:02] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: (2) While other countries will do business in their local language product, even a Street Vendor in tier1/2 cities will prefer to have his board in English to look cool/educated. Hence, proper indict conversation is either for rural or illiterate.
[2024-01-31, 12:30:14] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yes they are. My primary interest was multilingual neural machine translation (MNMT) models. But I think in today's day and age (sadly) the NMT research has been in a way made obsolete by LLMs. There won't be as many investments in NMT as there were before. From a career perspective it might not make sense to go in the field
[2024-01-31, 12:31:08] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: This is just my thought process to shift the focus to GenAI..
[2024-01-31, 12:31:14] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: there are dual boards no ? most states ask their language also to be added in boards everywhere. in villages, u dont see any english at all in some places, ai translation comes to use there for apps
[2024-01-31, 12:31:23] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: This can change if indic conversation can be streamlined with AI and every illiterate or low-educated educated can be part of digital effort, and languages can be saved and made predominant.
[2024-01-31, 12:31:43] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: i believe cross lingual transfer and STT/TTS are also very important use-cases and will start to become refined later on.
[2024-01-31, 12:31:54] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: they also yield to accessibilitu later on
[2024-01-31, 12:32:28] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: so the question here we should explore is are LLMS helping improve things that NMT was targetting on right ? if that is the case then it makes sense to invest in LLMs right ?
[2024-01-31, 12:32:54] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Haha politicians are doing their job to save regional languages, in the way that suits them.
[2024-01-31, 12:33:48] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: it is more than that bro.. not just about politicians. there are lot of books and lots of gyan in local languages. just don't go about by the noise you read in papers/media/internets
[2024-01-31, 12:34:13] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: there is also lot of literature that is impactful and useful also in local languages and continue to be written today.
[2024-01-31, 12:34:34] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: LLMs work well for translation between non low resource languages. in context learning adds some value too. But for Indic languages it does not work so well.

I meant in an overall sense. Nobody will invest in NMT as much because it is not a hot topic. GenAI is the hot thing, and I believe it will stay the same for many years
[2024-01-31, 12:35:09] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: yes, so if you have benchmarks of NMT vs LLM for translations do share. Why arent folks doing these benchmarks etc ?
[2024-01-31, 12:35:53] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: May be we can take forward this idea and compare translations btw NMT/LLMs and other systems may be.
[2024-01-31, 12:35:56] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: I think somebody has worked on it. A while back. I don't remember the paper
[2024-01-31, 12:36:09] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Sure, please share that paper etc. Thanks.
[2024-01-31, 12:38:22] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Sir, I know very well, I'm doing my best to help if you know what I do. Just frustrated that when someone from here had to train Kannada or Telugu Llama, they had access to only ~1B tokens, while there are ~3T tokens for English, and Noone is focusing on that. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-01-31, 12:41:09] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: The issue you know na what can be scraped/what can be extracted . most of the english data i think comes from wikipedia and c4 corpus right ? @19377081307 ?
[2024-01-31, 12:41:37] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: if there is a way someone crowdsources and contributes manually written human languages for 22 languages of india then that will be bring in more semantical understanding and tokens as well to llm work we are all doing
[2024-01-31, 12:42:10] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Interesting discussion.

From my side, I will just add that for any language,  customized tutoring is a huge plus, case in point:
https://youtu.be/PigaMHA5058
[2024-01-31, 12:46:02] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: This is a state government job, they are supposed to be using their machines to get these data but there is low awareness. 
In the beginning of 2023 not all Ai4bharat weights were available to download when I build kissangpt what it used to call. I have to hack xml file with E2E server link to download and use it. Now we have Bhashini from it, they should be working hard to collect more data, and that should be their mandate first.
[2024-01-31, 12:47:39] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: We are collecting huge amount Agri data, doing OCR and translating cause we have to run a startup. This should be government’s job.
[2024-01-31, 12:49:02] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I hear a government-startup partnership incoming ? 😅
[2024-01-31, 12:51:06] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: They are so slow for my pace. Also, they want for free so they look for foundations to do it, which are also very slow and run on different incentive. This is a task for capitalism.
[2024-01-31, 12:52:07] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Government-Startup-(AWS/Azure/GCP/Meta) partnership ? Perhaps imagining too much here 😅

[2024-01-31, 13:11:24] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: I think the data problem will be solved only if we adopt our own languages  (in native script) for internet usage. Doesn't need to be initiated by Politicians or Governments, but by the people. There is a lot of content in native languages but in Hinglish or Tanglish. It can be translated into native scripts and the same can be said for video content.

Incentive for doing all this data processing is the main problem which can be funded by Governments IMO

[2024-02-01, 00:02:42] Ankur Pandey: Liked the article since it exudes the current thoughts and concerns with AI well.

Few points I'd like to make. I think what's different is not that people don't understand it (we're comfortable living in world with complex machines and technologies an individual can't fully comprehend - from smartphones to electrical grids), or that AI has a foundational crisis (foundational crisis exists from set theory to physics), or even that it's unpredictable (we are surrounded by unpredictable systems like weather or stock market or politics). 

The issues I think is that there's a very human like intelligence qua intelligence. And that it's improving exponentially.

What do you think?

[2024-02-11, 17:20:53] ~ Divya Dixit: So manning gives the option of buying it as an early release that is if one is okay with the online version. We get access while its being written. So the last I checked they had the first chapter uploaded. Usually costs less when you buy it in early release..
[2024-02-11, 17:57:19] ~ Kishore M R: By the time he releases, a lot of content could be outdated. what is the time validity of such technical books?
[2024-02-11, 18:07:21] ~ Divya Dixit: That's true but also then we have to weigh these topics whether they have more fundamental value...industry doesn't move as fast as academia...from that perspective does the content have some transferable value even if llm themselves might be outdated 1 year from now...this is the case with courses too...I selectively choose based on the answer to these questions...
[2024-02-11, 18:08:45] ~ Divya Dixit: Another way to counter it is buying a site wide subscription (Netflix for books)...packt, O'Reilly and manning all have them...you get access to their whole library and you pick and choose what's relevant

[2024-02-16, 15:39:35] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: One kind of light bulb moment for me was - one thing I’m absolutely certain of is that we will be using AIs to write code in 5 years. We don’t know what that code will do but this we can be quite sure of. Want to see if others agree
[2024-02-16, 15:44:54] Ravi Theja: aren't we doing this now already? use gpt4/ other AI models to reduce the time spent in writing code.
[2024-02-16, 15:45:36] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Yes but I’m talking about going much much further. Because coding has so much economic

Nature of work - might not be code writing but other parts of workflow

Just random musings this, nothing anecdotal
[2024-02-16, 15:54:36] ~ Rachna M: I recommend that everyone should try Copilot/ChatGPT4 for producing simple model prototype codes in Python. You’ll be surprised how good and easily usable these codes are.

[2024-02-16, 15:58:39] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: 6 months back, for my client, I created a tool in python using Open AI to convert Lotus Notes Screens to React JS. The tool could handle 5 patterns of the XML exported from Lotus Notes. For these 5 patterns, it is xxx productivity. No testing was required. Sometimes, the Lotus notes script conversion didn't happen as expected, but when re-tried, it would be perfect. It is all done with python script and prompt engineering. So, LLMs will be very powerful that would vanish a lot of jobs.
[2024-02-16, 16:16:16] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Same for web scraping in clients I work with. Powerful agents can be built for clients easily now. Copilots have been amazing and allow us to devote our brain power on more advanced problem solving than simple/mundane already solved problems which are easier.
[2024-02-16, 16:16:35] ~ Rachna M: That makes sense if you run your own enterprise or have generous corporate funds. In Financial Services there’s a lot of cost cutting so difficult to make the business case for larger teams unless you demonstrate clear revenue growth potential
[2024-02-16, 16:17:27] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: The focus as Rachana said moves towards solving untapped problems and we humans are going to become faster and productive in already tapped problems.
[2024-02-16, 16:18:57] ~ Rachna M: Totally. Also code repositories like Huggingface have codes for more complex problems uploaded that you can obtain and tweak
[2024-02-16, 16:19:14] ~ Rachna M: Also other open source repositories
[2024-02-16, 16:19:31] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: I belive this year and upcoming years are going to be about discovery of this. Probably Andrej is down hacking such untapped problems right now :)
[2024-02-16, 16:20:17] ~ Rachna M: I think thought leadership, ideation and being able to lead teams and projects will become much more important than technical skills
[2024-02-16, 16:21:02] ~ Rachna M: Indians have potential for thought leadership, we should not limit ourselves to just obtaining tech skills
[2024-02-16, 16:21:11] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: And LLMs can also aid in those cases and product management and communication skills to techies as well.
[2024-02-16, 16:22:12] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: We need to start building great things and think out of the box taking cue from what sama/gemini (google) and meta are doing! Keep the bar high!
[2024-02-16, 16:23:05] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: PCs like Dell and laptops will come bundled with offline personal models now onwards and with more powerful GPUs and RAMs.
[2024-02-16, 16:24:01] Nirant K: The sum total of novel ideas India has contributed to the world in last 30 years:

The End.
[2024-02-16, 16:24:10] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Like Nadella recently said in the MSFT AI tour, don't think of AI as replacement mechanism/tech, think of it as aiding and making you more productive. Hopefully humans will find a way to do all those perhaps. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-16, 16:24:22] Nirant K: You can't lead without invention
[2024-02-16, 16:24:41] ~ Rachna M: And ideation and innovation
[2024-02-16, 16:24:49] Anubhav mishra Zupay: In/acc is net negative right now
[2024-02-16, 16:25:00] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Absolutely nowhere
[2024-02-16, 16:25:18] Nirant K: There is no such thing as in/acc
[2024-02-16, 16:25:27] Nirant K: It's ideation and pure innovation
[2024-02-16, 16:25:28] ~ Anjineyulu: I am sure models are not that great and is not able to satisfy every customer and sort of we have reached AGI in terms of predicting credit score.
[2024-02-16, 16:25:35] Anubhav mishra Zupay: That's the point, we should make one
[2024-02-16, 16:25:37] Nirant K: Like in/acc is an innovation of marketing teams
[2024-02-16, 16:26:10] ~ Rachna M: If you don’t make anything new and don’t have ideas, and don’t start new stories, you are just following others and reliving their stories — you are not a leader but a follower
[2024-02-16, 16:26:11] Nirant K: That's a different claim altogether
[2024-02-16, 16:26:37] Nirant K: Followers usually live pretty good, stress free lives fwiw
[2024-02-16, 16:27:19] Nirant K: FAANG SDE-3 is happier, fitter and richer than the founder who has raised YC round
[2024-02-16, 16:27:25] ~ Rachna M: That’s true. Until they have leaders who start passing on ghastly and stressful stories to them
[2024-02-16, 16:27:37] ~ Rachna M: 😀
[2024-02-16, 16:28:06] Nirant K: You can change who to follow na
[2024-02-16, 16:28:29] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Or may be when he/she hits 60, he/she feels miserable, I should have been building things back then too. Many such folks around too. It is all about the person isn't it ;) ?
[2024-02-16, 16:29:14] Anubhav mishra Zupay: We need you to start e/acc in India, let's write to Beff to give sone donation he's raised ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-16, 16:29:14] Nirant K: Have never run into anyone crying in a BMW, and have seen many cry when they couldn't pay their loved ones hospital bills
[2024-02-16, 16:29:26] ~ Rachna M: That’s the problem — not always possible. But honestly nobody leads all the time, we have to have the modesty to accept that sometimes the best course of action is to follow
[2024-02-16, 16:29:43] Nirant K: So no, some kind of pains are widely shared — no matter how special of a snowflake you are
[2024-02-16, 16:30:08] Nirant K: We've more money than we can deploy. We don't have any talent.
[2024-02-16, 16:30:14] ~ Rachna M: Have the flexibility to go back and forth between leading and following
[2024-02-16, 16:30:24] Nirant K: I mean, we've companies raising $40M and then going to SF for hiring
[2024-02-16, 16:30:30] ~ Rachna M: As required
[2024-02-16, 16:30:44] Nirant K: So we really to stfu
[2024-02-16, 16:30:54] Nirant K: Postman runs an Atlanta office because Indian talent was so sorely lacking
[2024-02-16, 16:31:02] Nirant K: Our talent pool runs a mile wide, an inch deep
[2024-02-16, 16:32:09] Anubhav mishra Zupay: And for business too
[2024-02-16, 16:32:33] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: there are various incentives for companies usually
[2024-02-16, 16:34:47] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Capacity to digest and take risk is more obvious there. .
If I go to raise capital saying that I'm creating a thermodymic computing system and require 20 million to design the first prototype, dead reckoning already
[2024-02-16, 16:35:40] Nirant K: It's your fault for staying in India fwiw
[2024-02-16, 16:35:48] Anubhav mishra Zupay: 😂
[2024-02-16, 16:36:18] Nirant K: They have been telling you to go to Pakistan for 10 years
[2024-02-16, 16:36:26] Nirant K: Sorry, America
[2024-02-16, 16:36:36] Nirant K: Or something
[2024-02-16, 16:42:01] Nirant K: From a state policy lens, we clearly hate entrepreneurs unless they're Ambani or Adani. Just look at PayTM as a recent example. Or the harassment which every manufacturing company goes through. 
[2024-02-16, 16:42:30] Nirant K: The cost of compliance alone is so high — not to mention a higher tax rate
[2024-02-16, 16:43:01] Nirant K: We can not solve a policy/state failure with "innovations" or whatever in/acc branding
[2024-02-16, 16:43:49] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Agreed
[2024-02-16, 16:46:36] ~ Rachna M: It’s sad times when you start confusing America with Pakistan!
[2024-02-16, 17:11:10] ~ Anjineyulu: Would companies be interested to improve continously or only when need or the competitor kicks in?
[2024-02-16, 17:35:12] ~ Rachna M: I think different organizations have different cultures when it comes to the pace at which they change.
[2024-02-16, 17:35:29] ~ Rachna M: And how they go about making change happen.
[2024-02-16, 17:42:49] Nirant K: I mean, it's not like the country I live in wants me anyway
[2024-02-16, 17:51:47] ~ Rachna M: Exactly the problem.
[2024-02-16, 18:08:52] ~ Rachna M: But in Mumbai there’s a real dearth of good opportunities at this time. 

I’ve lived abroad for many years but happy to live and work in India. I have a job. However it’s been super difficult to get good opportunities ever since I have moved back to India.
[2024-02-16, 19:11:36] ~ Bhumil Haria: Specifically in Mumbai or India in general?
[2024-02-16, 19:18:12] ~ Rachna M: Mumbai
[2024-02-16, 19:18:32] ~ Abhilash Inumella: ‎POLL:
Deep fakes
‎OPTION: AI can solve the problem it has created (0 votes)
‎OPTION: AI can’t solve it — needs a new layer (1 vote)
[2024-02-16, 19:27:36] ~ Bhumil Haria: My experience since coming back has been mixed.

Mumbai does have a few good places but obviously nowhere like BLR. When I was looking last (several years ago) I was surprised at the number of companies I could list.
Though in my personal experience the best combination of work+money obv has been directly working with US cos.

But interesting to hear that good opportunities are scarce even in AI roles, hadn't anticipated that
[2024-02-16, 19:33:21] ~ Rachna M: May be I am not applying to the right opportunities.
[2024-02-16, 21:14:19] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Lots of doomer posting today. Im not in India but I think it’s hard to compare the capital availability in a place like US or China with India. There’s no way to train a model like Gemini in India . That kind of money doesn’t exist here. 
But there’s no reason why there can’t be companies like LangSmith / LangChain out of India.
[2024-02-16, 21:15:11] Ravi Theja: portkey is here right
[2024-02-16, 21:33:38] ~ Rachna M: Agree, capital is definitely abundant in the US and possibly most other major New World countries relative to India. I think if you make comments to the contrary those are based on perception formulated through anecdotal evidence/experience rather than facts and data.
[2024-02-16, 21:42:01] Nirant K: You can't build Langchain from India because there aren't even enough early adopters of tech like OpenAI here. Langchain is 30% install base of OpenAI at best.
[2024-02-16, 21:42:32] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: India has millions of developers 🤔
[2024-02-16, 21:42:59] Nirant K: You can't build projects which strive from quick iterations from India because users are quite far, both in timezone and cultural habits
[2024-02-16, 21:43:48] Nirant K: E.g. spending $10K a year to save 10 hrs/week for a team of 5 devs is a no brainer in SF, but that's too expensive in India
[2024-02-16, 21:43:59] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: Access to India arrives at a very late stage always. So, we will miss golden initial time.
[2024-02-16, 21:44:59] Nirant K: On the other side of things, it's common for teams like Pinecone & Chroma are really able to leverage their valley distribution to ride Langchain and others. Even in the gateway game, Ollama and LiteLLM got the SF advantage — while Portkey is really sweating it out. 
[2024-02-16, 21:45:59] Nirant K: No, India has millions of salaried software engineers. India has possibly a few thousand developers at best who write code for exploration or hobby at any level of excellence worth caring about commercially
[2024-02-16, 21:46:55] Nirant K: We've access. We just don't care. We're lazy.
[2024-02-16, 21:47:10] ~ Rachna M: @917737887058 definitely SFO/Bay Area offers IT industry location Economies like almost no other tech city in the world.
[2024-02-16, 21:48:21] Nirant K: Ollama, LiteLLM, Langchain/Langsmith — nothing they've built so far is what we could've not built if we really wanted to. 

China was able to build an A100 competing chip in 3 years. We can't even build JS frameworks with global distributions. 

The best fit explanation is that we're lazy and incompetent
[2024-02-16, 21:48:26] Nirant K: And not that we're poor
[2024-02-16, 21:49:24] Nirant K: And to be explicit: if you tell me that LiteLLM is in anyway better than Portkey, that's unfair to Portkey — so we're not talking about technical excellence in isolation here.  ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-16, 21:59:24] Sandesh Anand: By that definition, everyone outside the US and China is lazy and incompetent :) 
Ecosystem matters no? The Israelis are at the cutting edge of Cybersecurity (they have a fantastic ecosystem for it) but aren't able to do as much in Gen AI. Does this mean they are lazy only for Gen AI?
[2024-02-16, 22:06:01] Nirant K: No, you can prove that you've _excellence_ — if you build things which people use outside of your home geo. Israel makes cybersecurity software for US and the world. India grows engineers for the world and ships them young usually.
[2024-02-16, 22:06:46] Nirant K: Also, by my definition — French, German, British are also lazy
[2024-02-16, 22:06:56] Nirant K: while Germans, Japs aren't 
[2024-02-16, 22:09:04] Nirant K: French not in GenAI, thanks to Mistral — but largely in software, have been low key inactive for a while
[2024-02-16, 22:09:25] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: Fear of failure is born with us. That is the big barrier.
[2024-02-16, 22:09:53] Sandesh Anand: Excellence is different from laziness. The former is a measure of the output, the latter is a description of a trait. 
I will def agree that we lack excellence in terms of building for the world (not just in Software. We export too little and definitely not competitive). 
But attributing it to laziness is a bit of a stretch (unless you have a correlation --forget causation-- that I am missing)
[2024-02-16, 22:10:18] Nirant K: I mean, okay for someone born before 1990s to blame their ancestors and circumstances. People in 20s and 30s are just not competent
[2024-02-16, 22:10:36] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: But what about immigration hassles ? And there are other nuances there also like healthcare is too expensive  to obtain for non US citizens etc. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-16, 22:10:43] Nirant K: I'm making a correlation claim, not causation
[2024-02-16, 22:10:53] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: Mistral is also coordinated by Eric, first Google CEO
[2024-02-16, 22:10:59] Sandesh Anand: Where's the correlation
[2024-02-16, 22:11:07] Ravi Theja: Rather than being competent I would say we probably wont dream big enough
[2024-02-16, 22:11:27] Nirant K: We dream bigger than we can ship is better way to look at it
[2024-02-16, 22:12:36] Nirant K: We do ship when we dream big fwiw — we have shipped world's largest polio eradication programs, organised elections at a scale unparalleled in global history without violence — and in last 20-30 years
[2024-02-16, 22:13:49] Nirant K: We've also taught English to more people in last 20 years than the population of most European countries
[2024-02-16, 22:15:07] Nirant K: I agree with the output vs trait argument.
[2024-02-16, 22:16:46] ~ Rachna M: Correct. I lived in the US for 11.5 years and left in 15 days when my H1B was terminated after a layoff. 

I think the insecurity which comes with immigration hassles in a foreign country is not worth it. Better to be where you’re a Citizen or Permanent Resident at least. 

Health care is super expensive and not subsidized for immigrants. Also if you move mid career you have to earn a lot to have adequate retirement savings.
[2024-02-16, 22:17:38] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: Born in 1964, without formal engineering education, still I am trying to do something in new technologies. Youngsters should do a great job. I bless them.
[2024-02-16, 22:20:18] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yeah, I also returned for similar reasons. Also family etc. Some things are not worth it / sustainable there too. 

Also my cousin left a very lucrative HSBC investment bank (strategy / derivatives) job in London, UK and does get paid luxurious salary working from Bangalore for a strategy firm. Drives BMW etc. My uncle who has been all In India all his 40s and 50s travels abroad the globe for trips from the money he made from a factory here. So it is all kinda subjective on how a person develops and keeps ploughing. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-16, 22:20:20] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: But now our UPI is going to be in our neighboring countries. To some extent, this is good sign.
[2024-02-16, 22:23:32] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: @919737576000 and I think in India Mumbai is more like fintech only. BLR, Hyderabad, NCR, Pune etc will be top IT hubs right ? In the USA nyc will be more clustered on fintech compared to bay area which is all generic IT/software/ai/new age startups etc.
[2024-02-16, 22:41:00] ~ Rachna M: Agree
[2024-02-16, 22:42:02] ~ Rachna M: Mumbai is a Financial Hub. But AI is picking up traction in Banks, Insurance Firms and Wealth Management and trading firms as well.
[2024-02-16, 22:43:46] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Add to that reliance jio etc whose campus is in Mumbai.
[2024-02-16, 22:52:53] ~ Rachna M: Correct
[2024-02-16, 22:54:42] ~ Rachna M: I think after the age of 30 if you move to the US it’s worth it only if you have stable employer provided visa sponsorship and a really good pay package and health insurance coverage.
[2024-02-16, 23:00:46] ~ Rachna M: Not just US, in fact to any developed nation.
[2024-02-17, 06:41:26] Shashank B Designer: Nice podcast - https://freakonomics.com/podcast/daron-acemoglu-on-economics-politics-and-power/

[2024-02-28, 05:57:47] Tanuj Bhojwani: Hello, I’m Tanuj, I run something called peopleplus.ai - Ive been asked to join a roundtable that is giving comments to the government on regulations around ai. As builders, what worries you the most?

By what worries you, I mean both :
A) What worries you as a potential misuse of ai that we need safeguards against
B) As a builder, arbitrary/overreaching regulations that you worry can block your business.

If this group has already been over this, please let me know?
[2024-02-28, 07:15:00] Nirant K: Sovereign regulations, specially in US which can limit access to compute and SoTA models
[2024-02-28, 08:03:49] Kashyap Kompella: Hi, Would love if there is an option to join remotely. Here are a couple of pieces that we wrote on how legal education and training needs to be overhauled. *The 19th Century Called–It Wants its Law School Curriculum Back*

[2024-02-28, 11:10:02] ~ Shreya Vajpei: This is amazing! Thanks. May we connect separately? Currently this is a on site meetup only but we plan to run virtual ones too 😃
[2024-02-28, 14:59:06] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Lots of moral questions/tradeoffs for us as a society ?

If an ai agent offers better quality & lower TCO, but effectively puts a human agent out of work, what should companies/govts choose ?

https://x.com/acgt01/status/1762770612852777199?s=20
[2024-02-28, 15:05:50] Prashant Singh JarApp: pandora's box---> Ok.. here we go ....like with everything else involving Govt . there is principal agent tradeoff . More often then not Govt represent "Govt" not people. so i doubt if this kind of forum will ever evolve to be more than a charade to give validity to Govt agenda .
[2024-02-28, 15:08:01] Prashant Singh JarApp: Govt are supposed to be run by consent of Governed but historically leader are more keen to use tech as a way of "Manufacture consent" than aggregate it . historically the reason given for the same was its practically impossible to consult /  aggregate consent /opinion of "goverened" in decision making ..hence we have this excercise called election. every five year
[2024-02-28, 15:08:12] Prashant Singh JarApp: With AI and Internet this is no longer true
[2024-02-28, 15:08:56] Prashant Singh JarApp: Please ask participant of roundtable to read "Sovereign Individual " .. I doubt any of them care though
[2024-02-28, 15:28:49] ~ Rachna M: AI will put some humans out of work for sure, companies/govt should make the choice to reskill/upskill/retrain the displaced workers and re-deploy them.
[2024-02-29, 08:31:00] ~ Rachna M: Google’s AI tools are taking reverse discrimination to new (and unacceptable) levels! While it’s important to put controls and guardrails to prevent discrimination and bias against historically disadvantaged groups, this shouldn’t be done by perpetuating discrimination against those who are not disadvantaged! An effective diversity, equality and inclusion policy doesn’t mean promoting reverse discrimination!

[2024-03-02, 11:30:27] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Not really 
App Store guidelines have existed for quite some time for in app payments,Google was lax in enforcing them.

With apps like Naukri ,there was a possibility that Google will end up asking for its share.

Naukri,Shaadi charge for micro interactions like sending messages.Fair game to be charged under in app payments.

If they didn’t want to pay they could have gone via Epic route which took on Apple in a court case.
Or Android even allows side loading of apps,third party app store etc.They could have made it available for side loading like Dream11.
But if you want the benefits of Play store distribution,you have to follow the rules,or at least challenge the rules for being anti-competitive.

Making it nationalism issue doesn’t seem right.

You don’t see the same companies wanting government interference  when they are imposed with gst,anti-competitive practices,or even worse mis-selling or cheating customers.
[2024-03-02, 11:34:47] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Reg OpenAI that’s very much fleecing for us that’s true
Someone from the group long back had analysed the token counts for Indic languages which were unnecessarily more

Same goes for Cloud providers
With cloud providers the bills are such a drain  startups keep switching providers for year 1,year 2 discounts ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-02, 11:36:19] ~ Rushabh: Not a nationalism angle, but just the fact that over-reliance on foreign distribution has resulted in Google delisting the apps even though there is a court case going on the matter. Similarly over relying on foreign models can result into similar things in future.
[2024-03-02, 11:39:22] ~ Rushabh: Agree with most of your points though. Just like telecom, cinema, and other things are regulated (so things don't get anticompetitive), maybe the distribution of the apps and models might also require regulation..
[2024-03-02, 11:40:03] Nirant K: We're free to deploy Gemma or OpenHaathi — it's free economy, no one is forcing us to use OpenAI
[2024-03-02, 11:40:26] Nirant K: I'm not sure the AI "model" dependence argument holds any water
[2024-03-02, 11:41:24] Nirant K: More important: OpenHaathi has 20K downloads/mo vs say complete garbage models like Falcon-7B which has 200K downloads/mo. To me, that indicates — there aren't enough of us who actually care about using Indian models
[2024-03-02, 11:42:47] ~ Rushabh: True but currently they are not as good as gpt4😅

And if we go on and use gpt4 then we might get stuck in their ecosystem.

Admittedly, we haven't tried openhathi yet cause we wanna try and see our consumer app first before deploying models but I guess we have to go in that direction
[2024-03-02, 11:43:17] Nirant K: Besides — the model dependence doesn't even matter? It's not like India has it's own Postgres? Or Chrome? Or Android flavour? 
[2024-03-02, 11:43:57] Nirant K: We don't even have a Microsoft Excel alternative, and that piece of software is older and more lucrative than me

[2024-03-02, 11:47:19] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: More GPU is just an excuse. Many problems doesn’t need a lot of them.

[2024-03-02, 14:12:21] Tanuj Bhojwani: Hello, Tanuj here - I’ve been working on Tech Policy for roughly the last decade. My two cents - government intervention, specially the heavy-handed variety, is always a double edged sword. You may win a battle, but in the war, you may have just changed one overlord for another. 

To use a term the government likes, I think the question to ask is what’s the “surgical strike”? What’s the minimal intervention required to let google also reap on its massive investment on growing android, while allowing others to compete without a massive barrier to entry? 

I think it’s that scary “apps may be unsecure” message. If Google/Apple can simply stop pretending that only they have the ability to verify apps as being safe, and that a security-audited public whitelist of app stores should be allowed to be downloaded without that warning, then we’re ok. The rest is user choice and caveat emptor
[2024-03-02, 15:26:25] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Perfect example of government intervention being a double edged sword

[2024-03-02, 15:32:15] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Government intervention in AI has created a huge regulatory barrier to launching AI models in India 

You need to seek government approval as per the article before you can launch any model to the public
[2024-03-02, 15:39:09] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: What's the double edged part is a bit unclear ? This seems to be a clear tempering of AI model release across a variety of domains?
[2024-03-02, 15:39:42] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Where's the silver lining is what I am wondering about ?
[2024-03-02, 15:43:28] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Just today we were discussing need of regulating AI models
And here it arrives but not in the way anyone has hoped it would.

So yes technically it’s not a double edged sword,it’s more like a genie/faerie who grants your wishes in the most absurd way as possible which cannot be useful at all .

[2024-03-02, 15:46:30] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I see. 

One thing I am noticing though is the article explicitly talks about permission before launching  to the Indian public, so in a way does it force one's hand to build in India, ship abroad, and reap currency exchange value profit ? 😅
[2024-03-02, 15:48:52] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Edit:Your competitive edge will lie mostly in building for Indian public 

Launching abroad puts you in a giant competition with competitors who have more   resources to throw at a given problem.Currency exchange value works in reverse in such instances :) ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-03-02, 21:58:48] Nirant K: I've a conspiracy theory, which explains why companies got de-listed today by google: 

Act 1: Gemma/Gemini are slightly anti-Modi: https://twitter.com/greatbong/status/1760728380008485331 — LLMs have the bias of data they're trained on
Act 2: Govt of India calls it a violation: https://twitter.com/Rajeev_GoI/status/1760910808773710038 — issues regulations which makes it impossible for anyone but Jio to do AI in India
Act 3: Google retaliates 2 weeks later with delisting Modi favourite companies
[2024-03-02, 21:59:29] Nirant K: Emphasis: Any resemblance to reality is purely coincidental. No humans, LLM APIs or vector search stores were harmed in the making of this conspiracy theory.
[2024-03-02, 22:01:43] ~ Yash: Video kyc

[2024-03-02, 22:12:21] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Why would Google make their life harder if they were already under fire for Anti-Modi output ? 

Anyone would reason that delisting Indian startups will result in more nationalism discourse and give the government an excuse to go after Google
[2024-03-02, 22:24:56] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: I agree, google has inadvertently shot itself in the foot.

Third party app stories like indus by phonepe indirectly reduce play store' dominance in India's largely Android market and ultimately impacts GOOG revenues.

https://twitter.com/sbikh/status/1763544188061470997?t=l3W2OYnA6N9PCtTTceL9MQ&s=19

But it's a catch 22 for google - if you don't enforce in app payments  or any rule uniformly across all apps, it will lead to chaos and will become difficult to enforce rules eventually

[2024-03-03, 08:55:31] Heerthi Raja H - AI/ML/CV: Thanks for introducing it. Will read
[2024-03-03, 12:56:23] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: This is being AI Policy and Philosophy group, I'm not sure why we are not talking much about Meity regulations here. If not defined clearly or implemented prematurely, this can end many smaller startup in the community, trying to build AI models or applications. I wrote following for feedback asked by a news outlet.

(1) We need clarity on whether this applies to foundation or even fine-tuned models. Is it applicable for applications with some user threshold? (2) If it applies to any LLM models or applications, then it kills all the startups trying to build something in the field and only allows more giant corporations that can afford additional resources for testing, government approval, contacts, etc. Right now, there is no sure shot way to tell if a model is aligned or not. Will the government provide an evaluation set for testing, or who will judge a model? Evaluation can be subjective, and will it change every time the government changes? If true, these regulations are like License Raj 2.0, in which only a few selected will benefit. (3) I would suggest letting capitalism figure this out and avoid regulations at this early stage. We are already very behind in AI, and this will just force every good engineer and scientist to move out. Our AI market is already very small and Tech far far behind, and people like us who are working hard to build cheaper model for Agriculture and other important fields for India, will have no bandwidth to comply with additional regulations. Don't forget how long it took us to build cryogenic engines, and we still can't build our Jet engines, and doesn't have even a single Semi fab. Premature regulations based on one bad output, can prematurely kill the whole industry, and drive away talent.

If there are people here who are influential in Gov or policy making should provide feedback, or represent similar voice, as we don't have voice there.
[2024-03-03, 13:17:32] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: Unpopular opinion for this group probably, but lack of regulations will be far more dangerous for the general public and users of AI. Not saying the proposed regulations are in the right direction, but there absolutely needs to be regulations for safe and ethical development of AI. We're already seeing many harms as a result of premature deployment of AI tools. Industries have never regulated themselves, nor have governments implemented the right regulations. Civil society, developers, policymakers, etc need to work together to create an ecosystem primarily based on responsible and ethical tech. If that results in slow development of AI, so be it
[2024-03-03, 13:21:31] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Not taking sides here. 

I just want to understand, do the policy makers truly grasp the tectonic foundational shift AI really is ? If so, who is on the think tanks ?

That's the key question for me.
[2024-03-03, 13:21:45] Nirant K: Can you share an example of unethical LLMs as it stands today? Other than calling Modi a fascist? 

Not asking for DeepFakes or similar uses, they've been around since 2018-19 — they've only gotten cheaper now. 
[2024-03-03, 13:24:34] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: Largely, no. There's a big gap between developers and policy makers, and generally neither understand the other. Hence why the ecosystem needs to involve a diverse community
[2024-03-03, 13:24:39] Nirant K: To be fair, this is an elected Government — and if the citizens want regulations, that's fair. If we don't want "indie" AI as a nation, it's only fair that we don't have it?

Europe has been doing this for 20 years and people look upto them with admiration outside of US for standing up to BigCo excess.
[2024-03-03, 13:25:10] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Any suggestions on how to bridge that gap ?
[2024-03-03, 13:28:23] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: Sure, from personal experience, ChatGPT automatically assigns the male gender to doctors and the female gender to nurses. This is a minor example but llms are nothing but a reflection of the human society and all its biases, power structures, stereotypes, etc.
[2024-03-03, 13:29:05] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: May be we survived using Maruti Suzuki for decades, or not having home grown Jet Engines, slowing down here is going to have really bad repercussions. The public have no clue what is going on, policy folks have shops to run with houses in Europe. The public will only suffer from oligarchy brought in by premature regulations.
[2024-03-03, 13:30:41] Nirant K: Is there a default set of ethics we'd agree to as a nation? E.g. women and men should be represented as doctors?

I'd debate even using him/her is wrong, and the default should be "it/them" to account for the full sexual orientation spectrum?
[2024-03-03, 13:30:55] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: That can be solved without slowing down. This is nothing compared to what may end up happening if we don't have home grown AI industry.
[2024-03-03, 13:31:27] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: Discussions and discourse are a first step. Creating platforms for stakeholder engagement with policymakers is another. I'm working on something similar rn. Open to suggestions!
[2024-03-03, 13:32:22] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Interested in learning more
[2024-03-03, 13:32:43] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: I agree. By default, "ethics" tend to mean western ethics which don't account for cultural nuances within the global south
[2024-03-03, 13:32:46] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: There is large scale discrimination going on without AI, which can be solved with AI. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-03-03, 13:48:23] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: That's true, AI has the potential to result in more inclusion, as long as  we can also develop the required infra as well to ensure privacy, bridge the digital divide, and mitigate other risks
[2024-03-03, 13:52:36] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Human are more racist, casteist, misogamist and whatnot compared to AI. When AI discriminate it doesn't have any agenda. We should be accelerating AI, improve on the way, and not regulating or slowing down.
[2024-03-03, 13:52:51] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: The largest pro use-cases solved by AI are in accessibility - STT for deafs, Visual narration aids for blinds. Where no humans are available in numbers to help disabled, AI has been a game changer for them. Also, helping bridge cross-lingual language and knowledge transfer - entire use-cases case studies here -

[2024-03-03, 13:53:59] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: We need to ensure benefits trickle down in intuitive way to those who do not understand tech as well.
[2024-03-03, 13:54:26] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: If I have to slow down bringing useful knowledge to farmers and improving their livelihood because my LLM mispronounce someone, then our priorities are different.
[2024-03-03, 13:57:17] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC7577280/ another good use-case of AI - drug and pharma development. Regulations are applied here for sure. But research should not stop. Products are heavily regulated usually.
[2024-03-03, 13:58:34] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: Which means the same set of policies can't regulate all of the AI ecosystem. When it comes to healthtech for example, a wrong diagnosis by an AI tool could lead to death if measures aren't in place to ensure decision making power isn't with the tool but with humans so that there's accountability. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-03, 13:58:56] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Like any technology (even non AI tech) all forms of tech including AI technologies are liable to be misused by few humans.
[2024-03-03, 13:59:39] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Human in the loop still exists in extreme cases in healthcare in most places. Even without AI there have been many instances of humans getting it wrong no ?
[2024-03-03, 14:00:45] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: That is why FDA has lots of regulations and they give permissions to release the products in this sector kindaa slowly and steadily. Of course, it is plausible that some of these permissions have been given with greasing of regulators. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-03, 14:02:42] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: In most cases, Humen are in the loop. Regulate prescription, regulate drug accessibility. At the stage, where India is in AI, we don't even have home grown foundation model that beats GPT3.5. Already talent is leaving on O1 visas, we will have only regulators and ethics folks left with this strategy.

 I can understand some viewpoint about regulating AI.. but How to regulate AI  is still an open problem. it’s difficult to regulate something when its capabilities are still evolving and hard to predict.
We as a nation are already behind in AI development , our ecosystem is still small .. Taking such a step will kill the innovation. This is a bad bad move which needs to reverted immediately.

Completely fair on Government's part to regulate whatever they want, they're elected for that job e.g. they do give tax rebates to mfg companies like Aether, Kia, because it gets them votes via the jobs they create — but then flip it around and use it to pressure these startups.

[2024-03-04, 09:39:39] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: Heard some VCs and other stakeholders in the know saying that actually the govt is fairly aware of the technicalities, but they may still want to go ahead & regulate to avoid supremo backlash.
[2024-03-04, 09:40:03] ~ Mrigesh Parashar: I think <0.1 % number is true for any support base. No body understands AI that well. But what should they understand is having hard regulation for a very nascent and innovative field has never produced good results.
[2024-03-04, 09:42:11] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Too much rhetoric around this, but ..

The MEITY regulation seems to be not just about ai development - like base models, etc.
It is about ai product deployment. Meaning you need to take permission before making live a product that uses OpenAI.

If u have ONE concrete ask - ask for removal of this.

U can decelerate ai development (for safety concerns). But you shouldn't decelerate the market.
Most startups are anyway deploying and not doing fundamental research
[2024-03-04, 09:43:01] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: True. My honest take is that over time regulations will come in some shape or form, but the people in groups like this who are at the forefront of genAI usecases must be an active voice in it. We need to figure out how such representation can be orchestrated. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-04, 09:46:08] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: I have had long long recommendations on this long time back. 

The second concrete ask should be a SRO - self regulatory organisation
[2024-03-04, 09:46:34] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: Asked these two to join this group.

[2024-03-04, 09:47:43] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KTagKkWT2n4 didn't find this, but found some other tutoral referenced in this slides also.
[2024-03-04, 09:50:42] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: https://openreview.net/pdf?id=BZ5a1r-kVsf and there is a lengthy pdf by le cunn here which is referenced and is a nice thought provoking read.
[2024-03-04, 09:51:06] Sumanth Raghavendra: The MEITY advisory is about "AI deployment" not "AI development". So it could technically be applied to anyone, not just those who are trying to build base models
[2024-03-04, 10:00:40] Amit Bhor: Can any pro x risk/harm point me to a issue not already convered by laws?  Credit models have had bias reduction for decades. Laws/Rules will evolve when required to protect customers. It's impossible to regulate without end usecase. Right now it will be like a censor board: Don't say stuff we don't like.
[2024-03-04, 10:02:25] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Everyone suggested that... however the US and EU regulations don't follow this idea. They are not end use specific.

Zero chance of Indian laws doing anything different.
[2024-03-04, 10:03:21] Amit Bhor: So entirely expected.
[2024-03-04, 10:05:34] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: @918095166122 from Nasscom just joined.
[2024-03-04, 10:06:52] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: Ankit, The group has been actively discussing the recent advisory wrt MEITY regulations on AI.
[2024-03-04, 10:06:58] ~ Satpal: If I put a model on HF and someone uses /deploys it (without govt permission) to say anti-govt things, any idea who'd be responsible here? ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-04, 10:07:23] Ankur Pandey: Meity advisory says  not legally binding - so not enforceable, right? 
Also - not clear in what sense it effects startups registered outside India.

Comments? @19377081307
[2024-03-04, 10:08:05] ~ Satpal: They also states that if not followed, will turn it into a law.
[2024-03-04, 10:09:31] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: We could use any clarity on (a) what is enforceable on startups if such a thing becomes a law (b) how can startups have a seat at the table to represent our interests? ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-04, 10:26:10] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: The first issue which we discussed few days back didn't give any clarification on legally binding aspect. It straightly said, if you have an LLM application, you need approval. Good that there is a clarification. But then how long we will have to keep dancing like this, every uninformed knee jerk reaction is going to drive out few real talent left. No one trying to innovate will have incentive to experiment.
We are registered in India, and running for Indian consumers, so it does apply to us, and mostly every startup here.
[2024-03-04, 10:28:00] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: By this logic anyone making a CustomGPT from OpenAI and publishing it to GPT Store will also need to seek approval
[2024-03-04, 10:30:15] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Reverse causality
Any new startup(not based in India) developing a really good GenAI product will by default restrict launch to Indian customers 

Bye-bye Cursor,GitHub CoPilot (?)
[2024-03-04, 10:30:25] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Theoretically yes. Anything with general public exposure has this regulation.

Of course OpenAI is deployed outside India, so we can splice the law even further.

But the litmus test here is actually regulating Twitter itself. Doesn't matter where it is deployed...they are regulating it as media
[2024-03-04, 10:32:17] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: If ur not based in India, you don't have exposure to this law. If ur Indian users are using this, you can simply ignore...the MEITY can ban the url if they so wish.

If ur living in india, unless u want the ED and CBI at your door...u better follow the law.
[2024-03-04, 10:33:22] Anubhav mishra Zupay: But what's the law 😂
[2024-03-04, 10:35:31] Anubhav mishra Zupay: It'll take at  least 6 months to first float a white paper, then 6 months to get industry feedback then 6 more months for it becoming a law, by that time we will already feel AGI, models will stop becoming woke. 

The only thing they can do right now is ban everything immediately ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-04, 10:36:24] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Those will be the only 2 possible scenarios & they cant certainly be banned. Hanooman isn't still out ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-04, 10:40:43] Anubhav mishra Zupay: The best thing would be definitely to work together and build a guardrail which is India specific, and let everyone use that. You should'nr decel just coz Gemini was woke, you can't build a thriving ecosystem like this when the west is fighting a corporate war ( musk Vs Altman) you already know that q* is AGI , some claiming it at an IQ level of >100
[2024-03-04, 10:41:24] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: I hope they don't push out crap like krutrim🙏🙏
[2024-03-04, 10:42:21] Aditya Agrawal: I am trying to do a session on the new policy. Give me a day.
[2024-03-04, 10:53:16] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Just like you don’t want Winnie the Pooh references in Qwen models
Something similar will have to be done for India
[2024-03-04, 10:59:19] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: To be fair to Google,barring the issue of Gemini being “too woke”
The anti-Modi output could just be effect of training on Internet data,especially Reddit
Such kind of rhetoric against Modi is prevalent in many online discussions.It’s just spitting out what data it has seen while training.

Why the special treatment to AI?
Does it follow that such discussions will also be banned ?
[2024-03-04, 11:02:08] Anubhav mishra Zupay: The best way to do it would be to not figure out what ideally models should do and spend 18 months, but to figure out what it shouldn't do, put a report option and keep adding to the list
[2024-03-04, 11:17:12] Amit Bhor: https://twitter.com/ETtech/status/1764519402936979907?t=BSmfHRdlOJQvZVG2xpC8RQ&s=19
[2024-03-04, 11:20:20] ~ Bharath: Yes. The tragedy is that our regulation veers between extremes rather than think of winning strategies for us as a nation
[2024-03-04, 11:36:42] ~ Varun P: https://www.moneycontrol.com/news/technology/ai-models-must-take-permission-before-launching-to-indian-public-says-government-12388631.html

[2024-03-04, 12:01:20] Anubhav mishra Zupay: It rules typically, it should at least comply at that
[2024-03-04, 12:01:52] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Add a custom instruction to comply with Indian IT act 😂
[2024-03-04, 12:02:17] Anubhav mishra Zupay: It'll actually work imho
[2024-03-04, 12:05:20] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I read this is not legally binding
[2024-03-04, 12:05:40] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: This seems as watertight as the advisory to not download torrents
[2024-03-04, 12:20:28] Gokul Krishnan: India's internet? Oh, the one that has zuck's WhatsApp, FB, and Instagram, Elon baba's Twitter? That one? /s
[2024-03-04, 12:22:35] ~ Ankit: Team , working out on some points and strategy on this 

WIll come back by afternoon on same
[2024-03-04, 12:26:22] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: What if they ban external AI companies to deploy models for general public in India? Will it give boost to Indian Startup founders working on LLM? Like Krutrim/Sarvam/KissanGPT?
[2024-03-04, 12:26:46] Pratyush Choudhury: How can they ban this?
[2024-03-04, 12:26:47] Pratyush Choudhury: Like preventing Indian consumers from using ChatGPT?
[2024-03-04, 12:29:00] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Like, maybe by adding extra tariff for them? I am thinking it on the lines of extra tariff on imported Cars/etc.
[2024-03-04, 12:29:22] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: I will cry in corner if this happened though 😅🥲
[2024-03-04, 12:29:40] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: "Microsoft"
[2024-03-04, 12:30:35] Piyush Stripe Growth: From a founder friend on this: "usual playbook of speak & act first, think later… Such a broad definition is essentially meaningless. Every single automation & software tool is going to have AI deployed within. Every business process is going to be AI enabled… so who all will line up for approvals? It’s like saying you have to get approval to drink water… essentially un-implementable. So what it actually means is… We know compliance is impossible. But if something goes wrong, we’ll use this stick to beat you.."
[2024-03-04, 12:30:41] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Good Analogy there!!
[2024-03-04, 12:30:51] ~ Kishore M R: We should build something like that from scratch in first place. From scratch depends if talk about from GPU itself.
[2024-03-04, 12:32:08] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Yes, AI isn’t commodity as of now. But maybe it becomes that way 5-10 years down the line. 
Even to build a car in India, in early days, people were importing technology and raw materials from outside of India.
[2024-03-04, 12:32:33] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: To enter India Market - global companies need to setup partnerships with Indian companies
[2024-03-04, 12:33:40] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: They will need to setup Infrastructure here (GPU Data Centers), more jobs here, etc etc.
[2024-03-04, 12:35:01] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Ofcourse - both pros and cons.
If Indian founders can’t step up to make use of such opportunities - it will lead to eventual loss to the Indian consumer.
If we can - win-win for everyone.
[2024-03-04, 12:47:45] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Anyone deploying models/AI product  to Indian public falls under this ambit 
So asking for govt regulation on external AI has resulted(will result?) in net loss for everyone not just external AI companies ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-03-04, 13:14:22] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: this is ALREADY in effect. No financial service co can use chatgp. the RBI law on data residency is in effect. Most of the bank deployments im seeing is private models.

[2024-03-04, 13:24:45] Nirant K: .
[2024-03-04, 13:24:49] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Yup. That doesn't violate RBI rules.
The RBI doesn't give a shit about LLM license. Just the data privacy and residency rules
[2024-03-04, 13:38:34] Bharat Kumar Ramesh Hashmal Web3: Yep. And PII. One of the biggest questions they're grappling with is how to ensure proper masking of any sensitive input data. And how to sanitize any outputs so that there is no bleeding of personal info in the outputs
[2024-03-04, 13:39:43] Dilip Ittyera CogniSwitch Founder: then they can use Azure Open AI models running in their India DC

[2024-03-04, 13:58:15] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: No
[2024-03-04, 14:00:50] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: Here's a summary of the advisory, 
- platforms and intermediaries should ensure content generated or shared isn't unlawful and doesn't harm electoral integrity, 
- models deemed unreliable or under-testing can only be made available to users in India with prior permission from GoI. Possible infallibility should be labelled and made known to users. 
- clear terms of service and user agreements on consequences of dealing with unlawful info are made known to users 

On deepfakes and misinformation:
If a software/computer resource allows or facilitates the generation of content that can be used as misinformation or deepfakes, such content should be labelled or embedded with a permanent unique metadata or identifier to identify the information generated, the user, and the creator or first originator of such misinformation or deepfake.

An Action Taken-cum-Status Report on compliance with this due diligence needs to be submitted to the Ministry within 15 days of this advisory. This advisory doesn't apply to startups as per recent clarification.
[2024-03-04, 14:04:42] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: what is the provenance of this advisory ? because im not seeing it on any govt website or gazette. want to double confirm it before we digest it
[2024-03-04, 14:05:38] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: As far as ik, a bunch of Twitter and LinkedIn posts from Rajeev Chandrashekhar and others in the ministry
[2024-03-04, 14:06:02] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: none of the rajeev chandrasekhar posts has the advisory linked.
[2024-03-04, 14:06:16] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: just double checking on the text of this advisory.
[2024-03-04, 14:06:52] Amit Bhor: "deemed unreliable" are potentially all models fwiw
[2024-03-04, 14:07:43] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: Also true, we've just been getting the doc forwarded in various groups. But news reports confirm the contents of the advisory
[2024-03-04, 14:08:09] Bhagyashree AI Lawyer: No it’s not on govt website. Apparently, it was sent only to a few such platforms and this copy has been shared by someone in GoI AI advisory committee. 

The signatory is a real person whom I have met once, so can say it’s credible
[2024-03-04, 14:11:28] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: There's a timeline mentioned for compliance and possible penalties under IT Rules and Act + this addresses "all" intermediaries. Why the selective sharing?
[2024-03-04, 14:13:22] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: i checked with a few meity officials. they do not have any info on this. so im kind of wondering on the text. they asked to wait for a formal notification.
[2024-03-04, 14:13:39] Bhagyashree AI Lawyer: That’s true and everyone has been wondering about it. Weirdly, it’s not even on the website
[2024-03-04, 14:14:20] Bhagyashree AI Lawyer: There’s a phone number and email address mentioned under the signatory. You may contact them and get info
[2024-03-04, 14:15:10] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: yes. that is why im checking if anyone else has checked the authenticity of the document.
[2024-03-04, 14:15:18] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: no success so far. not even with media.
[2024-03-04, 14:16:20] Bhagyashree AI Lawyer: Best would be to call the landline number and ask/confirm.
[2024-03-04, 14:16:54] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: yup. that will be the best idea before we dive too deep into discussing this PDF. fully agreed with you 🙏

[2024-03-04, 14:20:56] ~ Kishore M R: Who is an "intermediary"? Anyone who is in between public and the model provider? Does it mean the wrapper applications?
[2024-03-04, 14:24:37] Bhagyashree AI Lawyer: I just called them - they are checking this and have asked me to call back in sometime
[2024-03-04, 14:25:12] Bhagyashree AI Lawyer: Intermediaries are defined in 2021 rules

[2024-03-04, 15:30:21] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: With all due respect, that confusion was created by his own vague statement. And even his clarifying tweets don’t throw much light on the actual process they are thinking of implementing.
[2024-03-04, 15:31:43] Amit Bhor: Of course, You can't get more clarity with something that cannot be publicly said. 

Tldr: If your model/deployment does not say awkward things then you are probably good to go. This advisory is to beat up the "trouble makers"
[2024-03-04, 15:37:36] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: Yeah, but unless they speak of “troublemaking” in the form of an eval set or certain benchmarks, then this whole thing is as pointed a description as “AI works just like magic”. The fact that words like ‘labelling’ and ‘consent’ are being used is enough of a glimpse into their understanding of new AI paradigm.

https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/3/13/indias-modi-rushes-to-regulate-ai-ahead-of-national-elections

 From my understanding there was a rectification to the announcement which *excludes startups* with a certain level of revenue and some other criteria? Or am I missing something here? Seems a bit misleading unless I am clearly not aware of latest developments?
[2024-03-14, 20:55:58] ~ Kishore M R: Yes but the clarification was also half baked. What constitutes a startup, what deployment means , what "Indian internet" means and  what untested means is all left to our interpretation as they themselves do not know what, why and how of these.
[2024-03-14, 20:59:16] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: IIRC, there is a clear revenue threshold beyond which models need to obtain a permission of sorts? Could be off here. Just confirming
[2024-03-14, 21:02:49] ~ Bharath: We should ideally wait for sub-regulation (Rules/Notifications/Circulars) that could follow in the days to come. It is too broad and open to interpretation at this point
[2024-03-14, 21:03:54] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: The clarifications were not announced officially, hence whether it is legally binding is unclear
[2024-03-14, 21:09:15] ~ Kishore M R: Generally companies are officially recognised as startups by DPIIT. Less than 10 years or less than 100 crore revenue.  It must be a registered partnership or LLP or Pvt Ltd to even apply for the application to DPIIT. It was previously difficult to get recognised but in recent years after covid it is not so. That is where the official startup numbers come from.  AI companies can easily get it.

What about a gun generated and controlled by AI?
[2024-03-17, 16:30:30] Prashant Singh JarApp: who pulled the trigger ? AI
[2024-03-17, 16:30:40] Prashant Singh JarApp: not really

[2024-03-17, 16:33:27] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: Not true
[2024-03-17, 16:34:39] Prashant Singh JarApp: ?
[2024-03-17, 16:34:58] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: Just Google the list of convicted war criminals
[2024-03-17, 16:35:35] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: Officers, commanders, soldiers, all there
[2024-03-17, 16:35:54] Prashant Singh JarApp: soldiers get dealt with under geneva convention .. AFAIK
[2024-03-17, 16:36:03] ~ Vikas: robots can
[2024-03-17, 16:36:43] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: Also, the presence of guns and lack of regulations increase gun violence. Biggest example, the US
[2024-03-17, 16:39:16] Prashant Singh JarApp: US is a country of idiots ..switzerland has easy ownership of gun but strict laws and low crime
[2024-03-17, 16:39:33] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: Keyword: strict laws
[2024-03-17, 16:40:43] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: People in positions of power are very likely to misuse it. Power can come through access to data, tech, other resources, and isn't just political
[2024-03-17, 16:43:23] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Most of the people who seek tech regulations are non-tech folks, who can’t create and innovate, but still have some power and think it sleeping away to tech folks.
[2024-03-17, 16:44:21] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Politicians, Europe. Both are great examples. Europe can’t innovate to so rely on regulations.
[2024-03-17, 16:44:52] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: And most tech folks are either dismissive of regulations or don't engage in policy consultations and want absolute freedom
[2024-03-17, 16:45:22] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Innovate tech for guardrails, don’t regulate from outside
[2024-03-17, 16:45:50] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: America is great because it has least regulations
[2024-03-17, 16:46:59] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Where people start talking about regulation before even they can lead in any tech, those countries get red taped and eaten by regulators.
[2024-03-17, 16:47:36] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: If you want tech to be safe, start a startup for safe tech libraries.
[2024-03-17, 20:16:18] Vamshi: The gun metaphor is a bit of a mismatch. 

I think AI / AGI is like a dictionary that can also be used to fire bullets.

It makes it much more slippery to regulate at your airport security check. ‎<This message was edited>

Amazing work being done by Karya
[2024-03-23, 21:05:20] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This was a good read. 

And I align with a lot, makes a lot of sense. Hope more efforts like this come to fruition as well.

I have always just had one question:

How does AI enable the upliftment of the almost half a billion that doesn't even have access to smartphones?

I am not sure myself.
Any thoughts?
[2024-03-23, 21:07:19] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Will postface, with the statement that, I am not trying to be confrontational here. Just something that I have thought of with no real answers that seem pragmatic. Anyone with any thoughts on this ?
[2024-03-23, 21:12:24] Anwesha Hasgeek BD: I think Viamo (https://viamo.io/) is working on this, ie enabling access to a Gen AI voice assistant on basic phones without internet

[2024-03-26, 14:34:39] Gokul Krishnan: Helpful to think of why don't they have Smartphones in the first place? Cost? Network? Lack of education making UI difficult to navigate? Lack of good localization?

Good AI assistants can solve the UI issue, translation as well can get super cheap and automated.

If there's enough money to be made (enabled by better ML)  the cost of smartphones will come down and cellular network connectivity will expand.
[2024-03-26, 16:37:17] ~ Bharath: And in the meantime, Smartphones might get replaced by a smaller, cheaper alternative that is more accessible
[2024-03-26, 16:44:29] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Anything particular ?
[2024-03-26, 16:48:32] ~ Bharath: Something on the lines of a wearable or Humane pin like device that could simplify the form and components needed
[2024-03-26, 16:50:48] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Makes sense. 

Personally I feel, telecom network is the way.

Given the cheapest phones still have cellular access. 

Even phones within say $25
[2024-03-26, 16:51:46] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Humane pin type device operating on the telecom market will be a big win for humanity in general, if you ask me

Some other challenges to make AI accessible and equitable - especially for billion plus scale in a country like ours - are listed here in a short whitepaper by PeoplePlus.ai https://peopleplus.ai/adbhut-india

I feel they have done a decent first pass in pulling together some of the broad issues and are also working on some of them.

Like open-compute. Also, use case curation from India point of view. In fact, they are also planning their first offline meet-up for the use case discussions and more on April 6

[2024-04-21, 18:07:28] Tanuj Bhojwani: *I’m curious to understand - what does this group want from this space? Asking so that my org can sincerely evaluate if we can deliver on that scope and commit to doing it.*

First, a mea culpa. I’ve started this conversation with Nirant a couple of times, and he suggested we do this, but I never followed up. This time, I really want to see this through to a yes or no.

For context:
Hello, my name is Tanuj Bhojwani, and I run something called people+ai. 

I have been in tech policy for the last 8 odd years and have experience with things that are now known as DPI. I’ve written a bunch of things around policy and often write on topical issues to nudge policy like the app store debate : https://www.ndtvprofit.com/opinion/should-india-build-a-public-app-store-to-counter-google-yes-but-not-how-you-think.

Coincidentally, I’m on my way to LBSNAA right now to give a lecture about AI to phase V officers including Abhishek Singh, the lead for AI in Meity. When it comes to grounding the discussions on policy on facts, experience and experts we can easily facilitate that. Most recently, Aakrit Vaish & I tried to help the meity connect with startup concerns and would like to think we played a small part in that reversal.

I’m generally very bad at staying on top of my whatsapp so I missed the discussion above, but happy to be a co-anchor for the group if I understand what would be of value to all of you. What I’d sincerely ask for help in is the actual moderation of the whatsapp group - which I’d fail at by myself.

I don’t know if we anyone had a solid articulation of what is wanted of this group but I think generally people want to be aware of any AI policy change that happens in the world and what are practical
Implications of it on businesses. I think a little bit sci-fi is fine - should access to AI be a fundamental right But no more than that I guess. 

I think anyone who is a news and policy junkie educating the group on latest happenings on AI policy is the floor ask.
[2024-04-21, 20:34:55] Saurabh Karn Nyai: For example EU regulations on AI and case laws etc.
[2024-04-21, 20:51:57] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I believe Tanuj can also be the voice of the group or bring our PoVs to governing stockholders. We have a lot of GenAI founders here and should be able to help collect startup industry voices about any upcoming policy discussions.

[2024-04-21, 22:57:58] Tanuj Bhojwani: I can tell you that the government is going to ask for the Compute capacity setting up to be part of their 100 day plan. I am working on that too at the moment. We have some ideas on how the government should encourage smaller data centers, spare capacity, etc. If you have any friends who run data centres do tell us. We’re also putting together a list of policy blockers for the same to put into the plan. While the 4500 crore number for buying compute seems big. I think the government can create 10x that impact by just cleaning up some rules around data centres that are from a pre-genAI era. If you have any such specific notes, feel free to email me please at tanuj@peopleplus.ai
[2024-04-21, 23:57:58] ~ Bharath: What are some rules that you see changing because they are outdated, Tarun?

[2024-04-22, 12:55:49] Prashant Singh JarApp: * GPU and Compute should be there is tax exempt status . There should be a virtual SEZ for AI companies . They should be able to claim depreciation on assets .
[2024-04-22, 12:55:55] Prashant Singh JarApp: * Corporate should donate the old GPU to Education institutes and awarded CSR credit .
[2024-04-22, 12:56:03] Prashant Singh JarApp: * Deal with International  ( state and Non state ) stakeholders  to ensure India don’t end up being  a victim of regulatory arbitrage . There will be Kayman Island Tax Heaven like geography for AI . We should ensure it doesn’t happen or happen with India .
[2024-04-22, 12:56:09] Prashant Singh JarApp: * All Govt data in Repository like National Archive ,Museum , Parliamment session notes , anything which can be accessed through RTI  should be made available in public domain for every Indian AI companies to train the model . For free .
[2024-04-22, 12:58:21] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: How about a standardized, process-based policy for alignment? We can keep changing the model every time a government changes.
[2024-04-22, 13:01:52] Prashant Singh JarApp: IDK Man ...that require strong institution ... not existing today .... It require people who build  IIT /NID/ LBSNAA / Supereme Court/ Army/EC  .. To not sway with Govt and follow a policy framework on guiding principle .. we dont have that anymore .. Now the institute we have is like Ministry of Ayush who sell us out
[2024-04-22, 13:02:43] Prashant Singh JarApp: or other model is that of CIA in US . A little too free of Govt oversight and runing its own agenda
[2024-04-22, 13:03:01] Prashant Singh JarApp: I will choose CIA model over Ayush Model anyday
[2024-04-22, 13:03:06] Prashant Singh JarApp: but both are bad
[2024-04-22, 13:14:39] Tanuj Bhojwani: this is controversial. Why should the government subsidise a profitable business? People can claim depreciation on all assets already. If there’s a discrepancy in the rate vs reality, then that can be suggested.
[2024-04-22, 13:14:58] Tanuj Bhojwani: what’s the specific market failure here?
[2024-04-22, 13:15:59] Prashant Singh JarApp: for the same reason we give tax break to Small Scale indistury or Tax extra for Foreign Made stuff
[2024-04-22, 13:16:12] Tanuj Bhojwani: this is a good idea. Can be seen if there’s merit, but I’m worried there’ll be more incentive to just sell to a second hand market who will offer a better rate, than the government CSR tax break/compliance.
[2024-04-22, 13:17:16] Tanuj Bhojwani: I don’t think the parallel holds. Data center owners are not small individuals for whom income acceleration is a policy goal
[2024-04-22, 13:17:29] Tanuj Bhojwani: I don’t think anyone with less than net worth 5 crores is starting a data center.
[2024-04-22, 13:17:43] Tanuj Bhojwani: it’s not a new technology for which we need to provide viability gap funding
[2024-04-22, 13:18:27] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Good luck with the keyword tracking sir 😂😅😂
[2024-04-22, 13:24:44] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: With all due respect, there are approaches that are not linked to capitalisation.

China is taking that approach. They are crowdsourcing/subsidizing a lot of stuff in the critical path for chips.

E.g
 https://twitter.com/sandeepssrin/status/1779012584529854662?t=cEvFwQck9nKsAf-MUaMRMQ&s=19
[2024-04-22, 13:25:53] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: US CHIPS Act is major subsidies. So is China

[2024-04-22, 13:26:01] Prashant Singh JarApp: Interoperability of model . Like in UPI  i can wire money from  any account from any app to any account . same way i should be able to access anyAI from any app. WA should be leagally obligated to to give option to allow Anthrpic ,OPEN AI , Pai ,Kritrim .
[2024-04-22, 13:26:08] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: China is on track for a 143 billion subsidy package
[2024-04-22, 13:26:31] Prashant Singh JarApp: it will prevent default bundling . Like Window-IE
[2024-04-22, 13:28:55] Prashant Singh JarApp: interesting ... other day i was thinking of possibility of a SETI @ home like project for AI. There is enough processing power & bandwidth lying idle  in those smart TV , Smart Diswasher and Smart xyz .  a lot of AI compute can be load shed to them
[2024-04-22, 13:29:32] Prashant Singh JarApp: i know people have done  something similar for BTC minining so its not impossible
[2024-04-22, 13:31:17] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: No one will build anything with this approach on large scale, where all you effort to capture market is diluted by something simple as this.
[2024-04-22, 13:32:06] Prashant Singh JarApp: Internet was build this way over TCP/XMPP /SMTP  and OPEN Standard
[2024-04-22, 13:32:08] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: It helps consumers. yes. But as an entrepreneur or for-profit business, do I have an incentive to do it. None.
[2024-04-22, 13:32:52] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: That part is done. Enough research has been out there and open models. It is time for Cisco, Microsoft and Amazon of the world. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-22, 13:33:36] Prashant Singh JarApp: we are not paying enough attention on Chip/compute side of thing .we should be courting Nvidea to setup fab here to hedge againsts TSMC and Taiwan . I doubt if GOVT understand this .
[2024-04-22, 13:33:41] Prashant Singh JarApp: I invested in Tejas Nw Stocks hoping it will grow ..but its stagnate :(
[2024-04-22, 13:34:06] Prashant Singh JarApp: Unfortunately  you are right ..we missed the bus here
[2024-04-22, 13:41:59] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: It is time for Capitalism to take its course, new research funded by profits, and make India AI self-sustainable. People see the power in AI, and those who can't code are going to work hard to take a chunk of that power through laws, ultimately (I'm hopeful it will be different this time) bringing us back to the pre-1991 era. What we need is an article 140 for AI. Let users be responsible for how they consume and produce content using AI, not the AI. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-22, 13:48:41] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: W We are not going to beat China, Taiwan, and the US in Chip manufacturing. China has 44 fabs in production and 23 under construction. It takes an average of $10B and 3 years to build one. We have 0. We can compete in software side, by making India welcoming for anyone to come and do any research without restrictions, what Japan is doing right now.
[2024-04-22, 13:54:13] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: agreed on this. actually i brought up the china initiative in my tweet above because it is NON chip manufacturing. they are building a giant EDA tools initiative (using college students).
if u dont know - EDA tools are the critical step before fabbing. And most of the EDA tool work happens in India (Delhi NCR and Noida).

we already have the talent. we just dont have the govt subsidy to go about this.
[2024-04-22, 14:12:31] Prashant Singh JarApp: yeah ...There was this guy Ajoy Bose who started Atrenta and (i guess ) half a dozen EDA companies . We should chase them
[2024-04-22, 14:23:37] Prashant Singh JarApp: Much as I love Capoitalism and Ayn Rand I dont think it will work in India. Everytime India flirts with laissez faire capitalism it end up promoting Crony Capitalism and oligarchy .
[2024-04-22, 14:23:41] Prashant Singh JarApp: Surprisingly what works in India is far more simple . Lateral entry of domain experts for special initiative and removing of IAS civil servant . Look at every successful project
[2024-04-22, 14:23:55] Prashant Singh JarApp: * Green Revolution - ( High Yield Food Crops ) - M S Swaminathan . A Geneticist ,Agro Scientist
* Operation Flood : Operation Flood for Milk -  Dr.Kurien ( A domain expert not a beauraucrat ) 
* Father of Telecom Revolution : Sam Pitroda 
* DMRC & Konkan Railway : E sreedharan
* Aadhar & India Stack : Nandan Nilekani 
* UPI , ONDC  & DPI : Nandan Nilekani 
* Atomic Energy : H J Bhahbha 
* Space Program : Sarabhai 
* Misslie : APJ Abul Kalam
[2024-04-22, 14:24:37] Prashant Singh JarApp: Question is who can be the person to do AI & semiconductors   for india
[2024-04-22, 14:26:04] Prashant Singh JarApp: In Indonesia Govt ask Gojek founder to help and he did . In India i guess someone like Nandan Nilekeni or Sridhar Vembu has such clout
[2024-04-22, 14:45:42] C Chaitanya: The Swecha team is building an open source project like this. Use idle processing power to be used for training and inference. They are calling it AI@Home. I can connect the team if you are interested. I hear they have had some promising results.
[2024-04-22, 15:01:46] Vamshi: Isn’t there a project for p2p pooling of gaming GPUs already ? I vaguely recall an old discussion.

Along the same lines, have there been previous discussions on pooling a common code base from this community?

I know some members are more closely knit in working groups and professional connects, so asking for those of us able to be involved but possibly siloed / in a different niche.
[2024-04-22, 15:03:58] Vamshi: I understand that a shared commons is no casual undertaking, but it’s worth a chat
[2024-04-22, 16:19:56] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: I was the first dozen employees at atrenta or so  😀
And then Calypto - similar story.

This story works. Problem is that there is no capital for it in india. So u have to raise in the US - which means the Chips act kicks in and the india story goes away
[2024-04-22, 16:20:06] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: The talent is there. The market is there.
Capital is not there.

[2024-04-22, 21:11:50] Saurabh Karn Nyai: I guess both tackling trust problem with content as well as regulating deployments of AI applications are open areas where a lot of work could happen. But I guess the perennial problem of stale regulations is going to be the real game where the govt. will need to balance both safety, security and now sovereignty AND allow economic growth and innovation.
[2024-04-23, 11:03:00] Prashant Singh JarApp: this looks like an attempt to build chinese firewall whats neeeded in indian DARPA
[2024-04-23, 11:22:15] Vamshi: Before it’s too late to comment on this, I’d like to give a tip of the hat to the attempt at philosophical conversations from this community.

(Long read ahead)

I’ve met people here that are genuinely interested in conversations from first principles and enjoyed continuing on dms from threads started here.

Historically, we’re definitely past a threshold in the philosophical implications of technology post the chatgpt moment, into a new phase where philosophical considerations are suddenly of great material impact.

I do hope that our discussions on policy continue to be atleast somewhat enlightened by philosophical and cultural perspectives rather than mere geo-politics, politics, and commerce.

Most of the sensationalism and straw-man arguments that destabilise reasonable approaches to policy, leverage the typical engineers queasiness to deal with questions that are close to the human condition, and to dismiss them as being idealistic or philosophical.

As they say, religion is too important to leave to priests, politics is too important to leave to politicians and philosophy is too important to leave to philosophers.

All good policy discussion is rooted in keeping the baby and throwing out the bath water, instead of the status quo by people in pursuit of power, which is to throw out the baby and keep the bath water.

Engineers often throw away power to opportunistic policy makers by being naive in the name of being pragmatic and progressive.

Just want to highlight that balancing perspectives with human and cultural concerns can be an empowering addition to the pragmatism of the engineering perspective.

Do feel free to reach out on dms for heavy weight philosophy 😉

[2024-04-24, 23:14:19] Prashanth Harshangi Encrypt AI: Putting some thought into the definitions here - should search be allowed to generate? e,g summarization/blog vs surface relevant items only. When it is the latter - burden is less since there is no conversation involved.
[2024-04-24, 23:17:36] Prashanth Harshangi Encrypt AI: Why did this come up - I cannot make search be responsible for surfacing links that contain toxic content vs if search were to summarize and give me toxic answers based on the content.
[2024-04-24, 23:24:10] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: perplexity likes to call itself an “answer engine”

i personally feel perplexity is search++ (search +summarization)

some q.s that come up in this “answer engine” regime : 

1. just like robots.txt allowed site owners to control, their content being indexed and crawled by search engines,
will we see similar paradigms emerge for players like perplexity ?

2. In a way, perplexity is reducing traffic to the “sources” it cites, as for a vast majority of users, the perplexity summary is enough and users dont want to click on the “source” link.

3. How will websites evolve in face of this evolutionary pressure in answer engines like perplexity ?

4. in times to come, amount of synthetic (ai generated content) will rival & then outstrip current websites where human(s) have created/curated the content.
How does this development change both search engines & players like perplexity ? ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-25, 10:18:51] Hasan Tech Art: It’s a great question to ask right now. LLM Web agents are becoming really good. I am personally working on a few automation workflows to automate, looking for opportunities as an artist, keeping me updated on important art market updates etc. 
On one hand I will be scraping websites and social media accounts of galleries which is fine, they want this information out there but when it comes to pages and sites  who curate opportunities and repost, it’s more complicated. There are already websites which provided this as a service for a fee so, nothing too bad that nobody is doing but still, we need  new evolving framework to operate in this new paradigm.

[2024-04-26, 18:21:18] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: To bring this back to a policy discussion, and I think it's a great question - the central issue is to what extent Search is different from Perplexity (or any other genAI answer engine). Regulators like to break this up into an analysis of the platform's primary function and risk of harm. On the functional issue, Search is more of an indexing tool, so no editorial control  but influence in ranking. Perplexity generates content itself, alongside static links. That's an important functional difference when it comes to imposing liability for unlawful content because a Search engine is more of an 'intermediary', compared to Perplexity which is more of a 'publisher' of content.
[2024-04-26, 18:21:53] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: You can do a similar analysis on the risk side of things and that's going to inform how regulators think about definitions, obligations and liability
[2024-04-26, 18:22:23] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Thanks for the detailed answer Amlan.

Are there predefined categories of primary function as such ?
[2024-04-26, 18:22:25] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: This is an important  policy issue being discussed right now and we should engage with regulators on this
[2024-04-26, 18:27:45] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Right now in India the two broad categories are intermediary and publisher as I described above. There are sub categories for social media platforms (more of an intermediary) and video streaming platforms (more publisher).
[2024-04-26, 18:28:02] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Regulators recognise they need to develop a more nuanced framework across the spectrum. And question for this group is can we suggest a classification framework that makes sense for the AI value chain
[2024-04-26, 18:28:53] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Noted. Where can I read more about the existing framework?

To see what gaps night exist?

In order to suggest what a new framework might look like ? ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-26, 18:29:58] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Makes obvious sense. A complete overhaul or an addendum of sorts ?
[2024-04-26, 18:31:50] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: A complete overhaul is in the works. Nothing I can point to right now that explains this simply but if I write up something I'll post to this group

[2024-04-27, 15:02:04] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: I met with the PM's AI advisors this week across ministries. Won't get into the details here, but they are thinking along the lines of what we've discussed above.
[2024-04-27, 15:03:12] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: And I shared some of my concerns in the recent AI advisories that were issued -- who does the regulation apply to? How should they comply? Who is liable if things go wrong? (I'll link to my piece below)
[2024-04-27, 15:03:42] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: https://www.techlawtopia.com/beyond-the-ai-advisory/
[2024-04-27, 15:04:54] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: They're keen to hear from the local ecosystem. So I think it's worth doing some groundwork on issues like platform classification, data, copyright, transparency and liability and take it to the regulators while they are still thinking it through
[2024-04-27, 15:06:24] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Open question is what's the best way to frame a considered opinion on these issues and present it to the government, but there are folks in this group who can help with that
[2024-04-27, 16:12:12] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Having been at the intersection of law and tech for sometime, I can tell you two things:
1) Makers don’t have the same vocabulary as lawyers do.
2) Lawyers spot issues which are non issues or just definitional differences for makers

I think the way it could work is have small group discussions with individuals, wear legal hat and synthesise and then play back to everyone.

[2024-04-27, 17:10:29] Sudarshan Lakshminarayanan: The nyt lawsuit quotes a large no of examples in how the search results differ from generated content for the same query.

[2024-04-27, 18:01:57] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Sounds good. I can frame the key policy issues and work with you to gather inputs. Let's aim to share a 2 pager here for discussion next month
[2024-04-27, 18:04:21] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Cool. Excited!
[2024-04-28, 00:07:53] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Just thought of another hypothetical to push the liability question. Say Apple licenses an AI model (Gemini or GPT 4) that's activated by Siri and integrated into iOS. Who's responsible for a bad output? Will it be contractually decided between Apple, Google and OpenAI or should regulators intervene?
[2024-04-28, 02:14:31] Nirant K: Contract law should take care of this, but usually the distributor takes reputation risk
[2024-04-28, 05:44:33] ~ Arvind Sankar: I guess most countries are headed towards the product liability route
[2024-04-28, 08:09:26] Saurabh Karn Nyai: What would happen if the user intentionally breaks the guardrail to get the LLM say something controversial ? Would the liability still be attributed the same way?
[2024-04-28, 09:13:20] Nirant K: Partially. Malicious usage prevention is baked into most UGC tools including social media. For instance, a user sharing hate speech on Twitter creates liability for both Twitter and user.
[2024-04-28, 09:19:23] Saurabh Karn Nyai: In this Apple, Open AI case? The situation is probably 1 human consuming and transmission is default available.
[2024-04-28, 10:29:02] Nirant K: Single person consumption would imply OpenAI is the publisher and I'd assume Apple will push liability towards them
[2024-04-28, 10:29:30] Nirant K: Transmission is human initiated as such

So far, in contracts like such developer restricts the liability till the date of the sale. If the output is awry, based on how it was subsequently trained by the user, the liability then rests with the user. 

But, in reality it’s difficult to fix at what point and for what reason the output went bad.
[2024-05-01, 09:26:11] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: What is bad output though? Are there any laws that spell out what's good and bad?
[2024-05-01, 09:27:22] Bhagyashree AI Lawyer: AI Act talks about what could be bad output. 

But in my experience, AI companies define it as per their own policy/understanding
[2024-05-01, 09:53:27] Saurabh Karn Nyai: A lot of them. Plagiarism is bad, original is good. Fake news is bad, morphed pictures is bad, hate speech is bad, voice cloning and misrepresentation is bad.
[2024-05-01, 09:55:37] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Now one can make the model safe and ensure that terms of service are aligned with how users should be using it. But unintended consequences and a user breaking the user agreement which causes hypothetically harm to more people whose liability is it? I guess that’s the only question .
[2024-05-01, 09:56:13] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Should AI companies water mark all outputs and link it to some sort of KYC 🤷
[2024-05-01, 09:57:05] Saurabh Karn Nyai: The problem also is that who will adjudicate in these matters? Will all cases go to courts that have the capacity to understand this? Will we have tribunals?
[2024-05-01, 09:57:38] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Bad output = anything that violates local laws or the platform's policies. That's how platforms like YouTube decide what is 'bad content' and must be taken down. Regulators will need to define this in the AI context, likely from the lens of harm. That conversation is happening right now.
[2024-05-01, 09:59:15] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: I would use the analogy of jailbreaking. If you sideload an app and it infects your phone, that's on you. In a similar way, Apple is going to disclaim liability if the user breaks AI guardrails and causes harm
[2024-05-01, 10:01:43] Saurabh Karn Nyai: I agree. But as the field grows and hopefully guard railing itself becomes much more reliable, but in cases where users and creators don’t agree who really has the capacity to adjudicate on these things?
[2024-05-01, 10:05:37] ~ Bharath: Amlan, is provenance being discussed in the context of deepfakes?
[2024-05-01, 10:06:34] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Two things: 
1. In India, there's a big push for a techno-legal approach - so legal safeguards are built directly into the code (for eg auto deletion of personal data after the purpose has been served). What that looks like for AI is worth thinking about 
2. This approach may reduce dependence on courts, and edge cases if any will go to an adjudicatory board which the govt is planning to set up in a new law
[2024-05-01, 10:07:19] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Yes, it's in the recent AI advisory (see my piece above) but everyone agrees is a hard technical problem
[2024-05-01, 10:16:07] ~ Arvind Sankar: Which is very similar to laws on product liability. 
The manufacturer is liable only if someone cut themself with a cooking knife if it's handle broke (or generally manufacturing defects), but not if they cut themself due to lack of skill or inability, or worse deliberately ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-01, 10:16:58] ~ Arvind Sankar: Although in case of AI, I am not sure to what extent technical proofs can be provided to argue one way or another.
[2024-05-01, 10:17:48] ~ Arvind Sankar: This is very interesting. Sounds very similar to making something like smart contracts or self executing code as part of compliance
[2024-05-01, 10:22:47] ~ Bharath: Yes, though it might require lengthy audits don't you think? Not that I think the necessary effort shouldn't be put into vetting compliance
[2024-05-01, 10:27:58] ~ Arvind Sankar: True. But the other alternative is going to adjudicatory bodies after the fact (as after damage is done).
[2024-05-01, 10:31:03] ~ Arvind Sankar: How viable this option is would probably depend on technical feasibility. Example, after output is generated, you can run it through plagiarism softwares (like turnitin?) to at least hueristically check for plagiarism.

But this may be too computationally expensive especially for smaller businesses.
[2024-05-01, 10:32:31] ~ Arvind Sankar: A classifier on the other hand to detect if a text output is harmful perhaps may not be as computationally expensive (which I guess openai and meta are doing anyway with contentious accuracy)

[2024-05-01, 23:47:14] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Not exactly what I mean by rules being embeded into code, but this is a good example of tech doing what courts might ask developers to do after the fact - _Researchers at Amazon Web Services have come up with new ways to scrub bad data from an AI model that can lead to bias, data privacy violations, or copyright infringement. https://www.semafor.com/article/05/01/2024/disgorgement-amazon-researchers-suggest-ways-to-get-rid-of-bad-ai-data?utm_medium=technology&utm_campaign=semaforstory&utm_source=newslettercta
[2024-05-02, 00:15:48] Bhagyashree AI Lawyer: Interesting that disgorgements are not easy to perform and are still a developing process. The FTC has resorted to algorithmic disgorgements in judicial orders, but the companies could not perform them. 

I wonder how smaller players can execute them when the larger ones are still clueless ‎<This message was edited>

Good talk in which he brings up in-situ regulation, though he doesn't deal with it at length ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-02, 00:45:49] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Yup, OpenAI has been sued for generating factually inaccurate info about a person. OpenAI says they can't correct it through any technical means currently available (including I presume disgorgement). But the victim is saying - actually that's my legal right under GDPR, fix it.
[2024-05-02, 00:46:11] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: So what happens when the tech just doesn't exist to meet legal obligations. I often bring this up in the context of explainability rules
[2024-05-02, 00:54:10] Bhagyashree AI Lawyer: It’s going to be the same under India’s privacy law too. 

However, we need to wait till the judgement comes because reputational harm (the applicant resorted to this citing chatgpt inferred his dob which was incorrect), needs to be quantified. What harm was really caused by incorrect dob? Did chatgpt give an absolute answer or did it give a warning that it’s output must be cross checked for factual errors? 

EU court of justice has already set the precedence that the damage needs to quantified and must actually have caused a harm. Presumptive or speculative damages cannot be claimed. 

Law is always based on facts and is never absolute. Just because GDPR contains a provision to rectify information, doesn’t mean it can be applied in all cases. It has to be read in context.

Although the lawyer in me, sees this as a good strategy. Pay the fines and legalise the illegal 😄 ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-02, 08:20:19] ~ Nijil Y: Thr legal liability shall lie on the user till the systems get to that point. As long as these systems comes with the disclaimer is there an issue. We always had medical expert system but that never took the liability away from doctors right.

[2024-05-02, 09:02:57] ~ Bharath: Shouldn't it be a pre-requisite?
[2024-05-02, 09:51:24] Saurabh Karn Nyai: I wonder why we assess LLMs ability to generate factually correct information. Shouldn’t the production systems have some sort of retrival and grounding before response is given? 

In which case the liability is still of the company who is providing LLMs for end consumer. If the end user license mention that the system is not designed for factual correctness then it’s the user who needs to understand the difference between an encyclopaedia and an LLM generated text.
[2024-05-02, 09:56:56] Saurabh Karn Nyai: I think someone needs to define what are the minimum safety requirements for a production AI system? Irrespective of the tech that exists or not. 

Either the provider needs to set a different expectations of what product could or could not be used for or has to provide some sort of grounding. Assessing an LLMs ability to generate factually correct text and basing liability on that is like an automobile company saying the user sat on the engine and suffered burns but the tech doesn’t exist today to ensure there is no burn.
[2024-05-02, 10:01:18] ~ Bharath: Absolutely. The public are not guinea pigs
[2024-05-02, 10:51:57] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: What do you mean by production AI system? Is it different from a foundational model? Do.we need to define these terms separately and impose different obligations and safety thresholds?
[2024-05-02, 11:00:11] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Difference is betweeen a ChatGPT which is exposing an LLM and a RAG system which has a database and an LLM. 

ChatGPT would share the model output, RAG system would output LLM response but the difference is that response has been generated with information from a DB.
[2024-05-02, 11:01:27] Saurabh Karn Nyai: I believe obligations should be different for both. For example an LLM can be trained/finetuned/prompted to not give you answer which does not have grounding from DB.
[2024-05-02, 11:01:57] Saurabh Karn Nyai: RAG is a technique to ground an LLM response to contents in a Database and is one of the most widely used techniques.
[2024-05-02, 11:02:31] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Things will get slightly complicated when we think about autonomous or semi autonomous agents where LLM can call search APIs calculators etc as tools.

Scraping by private parties and private individuals is almost never allowed. The Dutch Data Protection Authority (AP) states this in a new guide. In practice, these parties can only use scraping legally if they do so in a very targeted manner.

[2024-05-02, 13:46:24] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: The existing legal framework in India is already very forgiving when it comes to explainability as well as incorporating personal data into models.
Pre-llm.

We were part of the RBI WG on digital lending. Especially on the explainability part. There is sufficient leeway already there.

This is combined with the US CFPB guidance on credit denial.
https://www.consumerfinance.gov/about-us/newsroom/cfpb-issues-guidance-on-credit-denials-by-lenders-using-artificial-intelligence/

There is extant precedent here. I do not anticipate any special innovation for GenAI. The explainability gray area will stand.
[2024-05-02, 13:48:07] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: We have already experienced through multiple rounds of audits here - all the SHAP & LIME dances.
Ultimately as a model user, you must be able to express how your model adheres to your published policy (whether it is medical, financial, etc).
Beyond this - nobody is going to ask for individual variables.

If they do, it's a court case anyway. Oh - already done that as well.
[2024-05-02, 13:52:51] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Ok this is good to know. Thanks @919810485533. There is a strong narrative that AI is a probabilistic system, a black box. And with more regulations asking for explainability the worry is that nobody can really comply. Let's hope that everyone here is able to navigate the gray area across domains and jurisdictions
[2024-05-02, 14:09:00] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: well everyone should be prepared to go to court. as with everything in these gray areas in the US and India, there is selective enforcement . The laws are not black and white - we have seen this with traditional models and we will continue to see this with the new models.

for e.g. you can NEVER say "oh its a model, we dont know why it gave that decision"
[2024-05-02, 14:09:02] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: that is an automatic arrest warrant.
[2024-05-02, 14:09:43] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: you should make a best effort and create a report and submit it to the regulator, police (oh yeah police complaints from users result in local PS asking for this), etc
[2024-05-02, 14:10:51] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: u dont have immunity here. neither are you automatically convicted. just prepare to fight each time. 
remember it is valid to file a police complaint against your model. this has been tried and tested in india many times and completely kosher.

His argument is that first AI will replace current jobs like doctors because we have extra compute but then we will find better uses of AI and then human doctors might come back taking AI jobs

Nothing in tech’s history shows anything like this to have ever happened. It bizzare.

[2024-05-09, 11:16:28] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: "We design our AI models to be learning machines, not databases
AI models learn from relationships in information to create something new; they don’t store data like a database. When we train language models, we take trillions of words, and ask a computer to come up with an equation that best describes the relationship among the words and the underlying process that produced them. After the training process is complete, the AI model does not retain access to data analyzed in training. ChatGPT is like a teacher who has learned from lots of prior study and can explain things because she has learned the relationships between concepts, but doesn’t store the materials in her head"

[2024-05-09, 11:41:10] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: The crux of the argument is that an LLM doesn't *store* the copyrighted work. That's an exclusive right of the copyright owner so storing the data would be infringement.
[2024-05-09, 11:41:47] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: The argument goes - an LLM is more like a retrieval system that is learning from patterns rather than storing and reproducing it. I wonder if the RAG v LLM distinction is relevant here @918197266977
[2024-05-09, 11:45:49] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Embeddings can be "unhashed" in a way so yes.
[2024-05-09, 11:51:06] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Couple of thoughts on this:
1) A core argument on infringement is that given sufficient copyrighted information a model *will* learn to reproduce similar stuff. Hence, we must carefully have fair use exceptions - as long as original content is not produced it should be okay - so long as the only way to reach the copyrighted source is by ways in which author has licensed.

2) LLMs don’t *store* data and hence factual accuracy is going to be hard for it. The question then it begs is can you copyright reasoning *procedures*? 

3) For factual accuracy grounding is necessary and hence distinction between LLM and RAG is an important one. If a Perplexity like system provides you with factually incorrect answer vs Llama3 Chat model giving you factually incorrect answer - are the liabilities same/similar?
[2024-05-09, 11:57:18] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: For 2, aren't patents on algorithms exactly that ?
[2024-05-09, 12:02:42] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Algorithms and ability to patent them varies from jurisdiction to jurisdiction. US is freer and India is more restrictive. Plus the conditions to patent algorithms is that it must be tied to a hardware and it must cause a “technical effect” - which will be interpreted by some patent officer
[2024-05-09, 12:02:55] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Having said that what LLMs are learning is not really patentable stuff
[2024-05-09, 12:03:03] Saurabh Karn Nyai: it’s much basic level of reasoning
[2024-05-09, 12:03:18] Saurabh Karn Nyai: haan - if you know how Q* works maybe apply for it now 😛

Who owns the copyright on the output of a genAI model that uses existing copyrighted material as input? Would it be considered as derivative work of the input or would the the copyright rest with the user of the AI model.

Also, does this change with the level of involvement of the user of the AI model?

[2024-05-09, 22:58:20] ~ Suhas Baliga: I feel the copyright would rest with the creator of the AI model unless contractually agreed otherwise. Because the writing is being done by the model. User inputs are ideas, language model does the expression, so I would assume the user has no copyright in the output. 

This is not a legal opinion since not yet decided by courts, but this is what I feel should flow from copyright law.

[2024-05-09, 23:17:46] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: It is like Piano maker will get royalty and payment of all the tunes composed and played on it
[2024-05-10, 07:04:58] ~ Arvind Sankar: Robert Plotkin made the opposite similar argument. He suggests AI is like a genie, which makes/creates whatever you wish for. The wishing part can be correlated to the prompts provided to the AI model.
[2024-05-10, 07:09:57] ~ Arvind Sankar: I would say it should be with the user. When cameras were invented, there was an argument that cameras are replicating a natural phenomena, and hence there is not creativity involved. In this 1880s case, it was decided that here creativity lies in arranging the subject/contents of the photo, finding the right angle for conveying a message, lighting, etc. See https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Burrow-Giles_Lithographic_Co._v._Sarony for more context. 

So if AI (like camera or a sophisticated paint brush) is treated as a tool, there may be a compelling argument to grant the user with the copyright
[2024-05-10, 07:15:55] ~ Arvind Sankar: The above is a policy arguement. The current legal position is different.

Most courts and IP offices have given decisions or guidance that there is *no* copyright (or generally IP) in AI generated output. This is the current position in most countries, except in case of South Africa which granted a patent with DABUS as its inventor. Australia also did, but it was overturned by the higher court, the last I remember.
[2024-05-10, 07:42:18] ~ nikhil@medianama.com: Hi folks. Good to be here. This is Nikhil from MediaNama.

I see a lot of old friends here :) 

Re this...Mostly what we have is that the Model doesn't have copyright ownership over the output. Copyright can only be owned by humans was one verdict.

Who owns copyright over the output is not clear because it's the fruit of the labor of multiple parties: the creator of the model, the prompt from the user and (maybe) data on the basis of which it has been trained.

I'm aware of France fining google for the usage of copyrighted data. https://www.reuters.com/technology/french-competition-watchdog-hits-google-with-250-mln-euro-fine-2024-03-20/

I find the position that model owners don't own the copyright by default a tad unfair, but also a relief. 😄
[2024-05-10, 10:25:12] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Machines will quote this in 2050 when they have to decide whether to care for humans or not 😅
[2024-05-10, 10:28:42] ~ Suhas Baliga: Interesting point. In the case of a camera and say, Adobe Photoshop, the final expression is controlled by the human. 

What if say we had a robot that can play the violin and sing, and come up with its own non infringing tunes and lyrics. Wouldn't it be fair for the creator of the robot own the copyright? the owner and user of the robot, perhaps not? 

Like I can own a painting and not own the copyright. I can get it commissioner (influence the creation), like a user, and the artist still owns the copyright?
[2024-05-10, 10:29:05] ~ Suhas Baliga: commissioned*
[2024-05-10, 10:30:10] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: i suspect Thaler's judgement will be challenged in court before long. Photoshop "magic brush" is literally ai - so the "human involvement" aspect of creation can also be a prompt.
[2024-05-10, 10:31:27] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: the courts will find it increasingly hard to disambiguate between AI gen or human involvement.
For e.g., if ur wearing a VR headset, u will be taking pictures automatically  at set intervals. So it can be argued that there was no human involvement there. 
fully expect a challenge there.
[2024-05-10, 10:33:51] ~ nikhil@medianama.com: Likewise Suhas! There's more to this. The problem is that with ownership comes liability. This is why model owners also don't want ownership.

An output is a function of, at least, the training data, the statistical model is used, the training weights and fine tuning, the context that the user has given as input, the constraints that the user has supplied as prompts.

Now who will ever be able to decide that the output is the fruit of whose labour? The model, the training dataset (copyright issues), the user (context, constraints and ask)... And do they want liability for it? 

I also find it difficult to argue against Pranesh when he said that ingesting training data is like a human being reading something. Reading is not copyright violation. 

At the same time, as a copyright owner myself, this creates a problem for me where once ingested, users might not find a need to visit my publication, and there is thus no incentive for me to create... Which is a loss for society at large if incentives to create, document and report new information is lost.

No easy answers.
[2024-05-10, 10:34:53] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: the big difference between GenAI and previous models is prompting. Especially sophisticated prompting like chain-of-thought. This essentially shows "intent" and human agency.
[2024-05-10, 10:35:38] ~ nikhil@medianama.com: Also on bots having ownership, remember this?
https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monkey_selfie_copyright_dispute
[2024-05-10, 10:41:24] ~ Arvind Sankar: Valid point. The arguement I raised only applies to AI assisted invetions/creations, and not necessarily in case of autonomous agents.
[2024-05-10, 10:43:27] ~ Suhas Baliga: Is Pranesh here? 😄

I think the issue for copyright owners is with models that replicate their writings. If models replicate without further creative process, I think model owners should be liable for contributing to infringement. 

LLMs aren't designed or supposed to retrieve and replicate, and isn't it also technically possible to ensure that they don't replicate training data as is? I think in the OpenAI case, there was some replication by GPT-4.
[2024-05-10, 10:44:59] ~ Suhas Baliga: openAI/NYT
[2024-05-10, 10:45:30] C Chaitanya: If the models own the copyright, they should be liable to face the copyright suits. You can't have the cake and eat it too :)

[2024-05-10, 11:20:47] ~ nikhil@medianama.com: Nyt vs OpenAI. Basically, nyt was able to replicate certain articles paragraph by paragraph. 

The article in question had been licensed by some other site and published outside the paywall.

Nyt's contention, and rightly so, is that just because it's public it shouldn't be replicable. They lose licensing revenue this way 

Even there, the replication isn't exact. Some phrases and words are different. But substantively it's a replication.

Also this process is hard to reproduce, which is OpenAI's argument.
[2024-05-10, 11:21:15] ~ nikhil@medianama.com: Not sure if it has been shared here previously, but https://www.adweek.com/media/openai-preferred-publisher-program-deck/

[2024-05-17, 11:30:26] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: I just published this report on the many dimensions to India's compute strategy - how to build compute and make it accessible
[2024-05-17, 11:31:45] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Key observations: India's AI ambitions require significantly more compute resources than currently allocated under the AI mission (~4k crores). Rather, public investment should be balanced across the 'compute stack', not just acquiring GPUs. Lots of demand side challenges also apparent - hyperscalers are meeting current demand, but transparency in pricing and interoperability is a challenge. Finally, because demand for compute in India is unclear (lack of data, foreign alternatives, etc.), we need more reliable data on how existing compute capacity is actually being used.
[2024-05-17, 11:33:07] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Some early recommendations: Define the goals on compute more clearly (social impact? sovereignty? financial returns?). There are many ways to build and manage compute infrastructure - we need to study these approaches in detail since the government has already started the procurement process under a PPP model. Also, the government should drive local demand by highlighting priority use cases and enable affordable access through digital public infrastructure (DPIs). Additionally, building dedicated clusters for academic research and national security is a priority. Lastly, data, skilling, and regulation should be addressed in conjunction with compute as part of a broader AI strategy.
[2024-05-17, 11:34:27] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: This report on compute was based on meetings with key stakeholders in the AI policy ecosystem. If you'd like to be involved in future meetings, please DM me. Thanks!

[2024-05-17, 12:54:42] Tanuj Bhojwani: The government of India has a point of view that India should be producing these models. It stems from the same philosophy that India as a country should have an atomic mission or a space mission. Commendable goals, and I support it. The how though is up for a lot of debate.
[2024-05-17, 12:55:38] Tanuj Bhojwani: Nandan is primarily a philanthropist. His goal is not whether India is capable, but rather if Indians are served. For shorthand, “india needs” but better interpreted as “indians need”
[2024-05-17, 12:55:55] Tanuj Bhojwani: This is undeniably true. This happened in the Vishal Sikka era.
[2024-05-17, 12:56:44] Tanuj Bhojwani: The man was ahead of his times, sad what happened between him and Murthy. Who knows where Infosys would’ve been if not for this. This is the tussle that led to Nandan coming back to Infosys, he was otherwise very hands-off on infosys.
[2024-05-17, 12:58:16] Tanuj Bhojwani: My simple (and therefore definitionally flawed) analogy is mobility. Indians need to go from point A to B. You can ask when will be build our own Jaguars, Hummers, Mercedes and Ferraris. But the pragmatist will say boss build your activas first.
[2024-05-17, 12:59:56] Tanuj Bhojwani: Bangalore car traffic makes you forget it, but we are a two-wheeler country primarily. Less than 8% of households have a car.
[2024-05-17, 13:03:06] Nirant K: Why not both? Korea, China, Viet Nam, Japan did both.

But I digress, thanks for taking the time to share and expand
[2024-05-17, 13:03:24] Nirant K: This is a great and pithy phrasing. Like it!
[2024-05-17, 13:04:40] Tanuj Bhojwani: I think both too. It’s just about who you are and what levers of influence you have. Government should aim for capability, Nandan should aim for impact. Is either of them wrong? no. The media (and we also) love to forgo nuance.
[2024-05-17, 13:05:36] Tanuj Bhojwani: I like this group therefore, and can have this conversation here. But in the press, I’ll also be reinterpreted as being in one camp or the other. And someone in some other whatsapp group is probably calling me daft too 🙂

[2024-05-17, 13:06:06] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Do we think then the foundation model research should be left to highly funded institutions (model that has worked for India, ISRO, DRDO), while drive startup ecosystem on something that is monetizable as Indian consumers are still not there to pay for GenAI services, enabling model work at startup ecosystem level. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-05-17, 13:43:52] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yes. That would be amazing.
[2024-05-17, 13:44:48] ~ Tapan: Sounds interesting. I'm well connected with the team at INDIAai, MeiTY, and Nasscom for two years now. I've been a part of their first Gen AI report and a few of their personal projects. This one sounds new :)

@919867104169 , I'd like to know more about this.
[2024-05-17, 13:45:41] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: If Iran and Turkey can mass produce drones, I dont know are we missing.
[2024-05-17, 13:45:58] Prashant Singh JarApp: What kind of role ?
[2024-05-17, 13:47:24] Amit Malik Aviva Life Insurance: Keen to more about  the role - where can I find it ?
[2024-05-17, 13:57:18] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Way I look at it is, we're suffering from tyranny of low expectations. As Indians we excel at self flagellation.
[2024-05-17, 13:58:22] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: There should be any questions at all whether we need our own foundational models or not. It's not a choice at this point.
[2024-05-17, 13:58:49] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: China is already building robot armies ffs
[2024-05-17, 14:00:35] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: We are living through what's possibly the greatest transformational event in human history. We can't be bystanders. Come on.
[2024-05-17, 14:35:21] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: This is not it. This link is to a set of  recommendations from Meity preceeding the AI mission. This is a recent press release on the AI mission: https://pib.gov.in/PressReleasePage.aspx?PRID=2012375
[2024-05-17, 14:37:31] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Thank you. The question of whether to build sovereign compute or not (and what that means) is separate from the question of whether india should build its own models (models are not part of the compute stack)
[2024-05-17, 16:10:48] Saurabh Karn Nyai: I think the question is not if India should build its model. There are tons of companies which are fine tuning foundational models and are by license their property with some restrictions.

Question around if India should build its own model is if it should go out and procure internet scale data and some more and pre train a model from scratch. Then it becomes a question of money where the conversation of large corps or Govt. Becomes necessary.
[2024-05-17, 16:11:22] Saurabh Karn Nyai: What does govt. bring? Ability to pour in large sums of money which usually can’t be done even by private entities. TSMC for example.
[2024-05-17, 16:12:19] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Then there is use case approach. Could Indian govt. be shareholders in Private companies and support them by actively advocating and doing BD for them? Doesn’t seem like the kind of things babus will like to do.
[2024-05-17, 16:13:11] Saurabh Karn Nyai: But the question on models to my mind is this - should you pour in billions of dollars to build large scale models and license them as you will? Or should you focus on building applications by consuming these models?
[2024-05-17, 16:14:37] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Around 10k GPU procurement - it is not clear if the computer capacity other than training will be on cloud or edge and to what distribution. So this 10k GPUs seems to me as if govt. Will become a cloud provider which again begs a question - how good a solution provider govt. is?
[2024-05-17, 16:15:15] Saurabh Karn Nyai: The answer is neither 0 GPUs nor 10k GPUs and probably not even procurement by central govt.
[2024-05-17, 18:17:58] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: My sense is the government will use 'empaneled cloud service providers' for last mile deployment of compute - it will not replace CSPs
[2024-05-17, 18:19:10] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: FWIW - building indigenous LLMs is part of the official strategy under thr AI mission ( based on the internal docs I’ve referred to in my report above)
[2024-05-17, 18:25:49] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Then it begs other policy question on data and where and how it will be sourced because we clearly want to build indigenous LLM - assuming from scratch. How will this be licensed? etc. Fun times ahead!
[2024-05-17, 18:31:17] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: There’s a plan to build a datasets platform (with a small allocation of the 10k crores) - so data access is also part of the AI mission and they’re all interrelated, but i think it’s clear that more debate is required and more voices from this community need to be heard by policymakers
[2024-05-17, 18:56:14] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Govt. Of India for voice data collection has bhasha daan where someone can contribute the data for model training. Maybe they are referring to that and broadening its scope.
[2024-05-17, 18:57:00] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Is anyone in ministry doing feasibility or calculations around how much data how many people how much compute for what is needed? Or is it outsourced to some consulting firm to be doing that?
[2024-05-17, 19:19:13] ~ Tapan: Their website says it's managed and operated by TDIL (Technology Development for Indian Languages)
[2024-05-17, 19:20:37] Saurabh Karn Nyai: I think it’s the name of program and not an entity
[2024-05-17, 19:22:31] ~ Tapan: Then maybe MeiTY must be looking after this. 

Let me ask around.
[2024-05-17, 19:28:19] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: No, it’s all anecdotal. We think there needs to be a study.

[2024-05-17, 20:47:00] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: On the point of data collection, i think it is mostly a money problem. The more money you throw at it, the more data you can collect. We have enough manpower in India to go out collect data on whatever you need, from pre-training to fine-tuning to other specialised datasets.
[2024-05-17, 20:48:50] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: There are lot of data collection efforts going on. They are mostly hampered by funding. There are also established models we can build upon. Govt already collects a lot of data, from surveys to census.
[2024-05-17, 20:51:57] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: The govt also generates a ton of data; land records, local governance, judicial, taxation, etc. Imagine we digitize all the data that are stored up in the sarkari offices and pre-train an LLM on it, then fine-tune it with well crafted datasets, we can probably make agents that can automate the whole bureaucracy one day.
[2024-05-17, 20:53:34] Saurabh Karn Nyai: True that. I guess govt. needs to add significant digitisation budget to the mix.
[2024-05-17, 20:54:18] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: We can train it for judiciary, make automated judges (not the dystopian kind), tackle the huge pendency of cases.
[2024-05-17, 20:56:48] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: We can probably reimagine bureaucracy and judiciary in completely new way. Those are the two biggest roadblocks in Indian growth story. Sanjeev Sanyal points it out in his books.

[2024-05-18, 13:38:31] ~ nikhil@medianama.com: Certainly don't want a minority report situation
[2024-05-18, 20:24:30] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: There's definitely a lot of research required for such kind of moonshots. I was trying to back up my case of building foundational models in India. We have an opportunity to fundamentally transform bureaucracy and judiciary with AI in a full stack manner. As technologists, our job is to point out that the tech is there.
[2024-05-18, 20:27:12] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: The policymakers who are upstream can take as a signal when they do their work. They'll probably also collate some signals from academics (R&D) and industry (compute).
[2024-05-18, 20:29:33] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: We can think much much bigger than the application layer.

[2024-05-19, 07:06:56] ~ Rohit: seems a bit necessary, no? even pre-abacus openai had suspect agendas (esp after they ditched their non profit research statement), and with the clause about reclawing vested equity for former employees is very bully-like
[2024-05-19, 07:07:40] ~ Rohit: i’m not an ai doomer but openai really only cares about the moat now, but superalignment is very necessary long term i feel
[2024-05-19, 07:38:38] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I'm not saying everything is clean but Sam did provide clarification https://x.com/sama/status/1791936857594581428?s=46
[2024-05-19, 07:39:18] ~ Rohit: yes, i think the clarification was due once the negative pr and crazy articles started rolling in

[2024-05-19, 10:52:21] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: It seems the super alignment team wanted more access to compute inside the company, which it didn’t get
[2024-05-19, 10:54:42] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: AI safety research will require dedicated compute. I missed that aspect in my report about compute for India. I wonder how that debate will shape up at a national level, in India and other countries. Is that an area that the EU will prioritise and win?

[2024-05-19, 13:37:40] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: How much compute would they be having
[2024-05-19, 13:39:13] Nirant K: None
[2024-05-19, 13:39:44] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Is this count real though
[2024-05-19, 13:44:40] Nirant K: Probably over and under counting at the same time
[2024-05-19, 13:45:20] Nirant K: As is with the most process engineering things
[2024-05-19, 13:45:59] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I think the number can be high now, but resources and incentives are not there for everyone to start training foundational models.
[2024-05-19, 13:46:02] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Is it me or maybe a lot of crypto miners can actually train a "foundational model" but they aren't counted
[2024-05-19, 13:46:23] Nirant K: For instance, there's only a handful of countries can make even the Azure Supercomputer to run GPT scale inference
[2024-05-19, 13:46:51] Nirant K: India can't build a Bing scale and quality good search engine, much less GPT
[2024-05-19, 13:47:03] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Also, why would you train one that can't keep a lead for more than a month, unless you're snowflake, databricks or other huge companies targetting enterprise models.
[2024-05-19, 13:48:41] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: There is huge difference between distributed mining and setting up infra using same GPUs for foundational training. Check out Microsoft’s email that got published recently.
[2024-05-19, 13:49:07] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Can you share a link
[2024-05-19, 13:51:56] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Search for Kevin Scott email
[2024-05-19, 13:52:44] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Microsoft with its might and army of scientists decided to invest in openAI cause they were a lot behind
[2024-05-19, 13:54:10] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: At the scale Microsoft is, it would make more sense to acquire/invest in someone who's doing it over building even if they could right?
[2024-05-19, 13:55:10] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Amazon couldn't. They tried spending 1.4B and failed miserably. Inside news.
[2024-05-19, 13:56:19] ~ Karthik Prabhu: It’s not just the llm. Microsoft enterprise infrastructure was just mature enough to take full advantage of generative AI.
[2024-05-19, 14:00:25] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: It was not, according to the email. Working with OpenAI closely to help them gave them learning about that, and now they have the best one.
[2024-05-19, 14:01:06] ~ Karthik Prabhu: I think Microsoft’s investments in stuff like Microsoft graph long precede llm development which gave it the edge
[2024-05-19, 14:01:22] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: So writing code to train the foundational model, and training one are two different things.
[2024-05-19, 14:01:37] ~ Karthik Prabhu: To actually implement generative AI
[2024-05-19, 14:01:47] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Should read the email

[2024-05-20, 11:18:47] ~ nikhil@medianama.com: I think technologists can no longer pass the buck to policymakers on this. They have to take into account responsibility for the tech they build. Policymakers often cannot be trusted.

For example, policymakers globally actively oppose E2E encryption and HTTPS everywhere. Responsible tech players push for it. 

Saying that we just do the tech and that's where our job ends doesn't cut it anymore, especially when policymakers cannot be trusted.
[2024-05-20, 11:24:58] Sandesh Anand: This is true for all areas of Policymaking. Experts have to get involved. NASSCOM is a good example of how involvement from experts is critical and can move the ball forward in policymaking.
[2024-05-20, 11:31:53] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: If policymakers can't be trusted, maybe we should replace policymakers with AI 🤣
[2024-05-20, 11:33:53] Keertana S Suvy: I'm currently working on a research which surveys government workers large scale (outside India country) - from senior managers to beginner grade employees - around a third of everyone says that developers should take responsibility for the ethics of the AI they build and ship. Downstream, a lot of people don't understand a lot which creates a huge gap
[2024-05-20, 11:34:42] Keertana S Suvy: Now, the ideal case is policymaking and AI engineers to play hand in hand, but how efficient/real time is this communication?
[2024-05-20, 11:45:54] ~ nikhil@medianama.com: No one can be fully trusted. Nobody is perfect. We need counterbalances, and that's what civil society and technologists who work on civil liberties provide. I wouldn't fully trust nasscom either. Everything has its internal politics.

[2024-05-20, 11:48:34] ~ nikhil@medianama.com: I met Kaspar Kovas, then head of e-residency at Estonia over lunch once. We were talking about democracy and elections, and he said, in a cold eastern European accent: "what is free will? It's just chemicals in our brains. We elect people who are good at being elected and not necessarily at governance. Algorithms will be better at figuring out who should be elected for better governance.
[2024-05-20, 11:50:36] ~ nikhil@medianama.com: We also discussed this idea of the state as a service. That people should be free to choose which state they move to, based on which state provides better services for their taxes. The state as a service provider...And states should be free to run their algorithms to figure out who becomes a citizen.
[2024-05-20, 11:51:24] ~ nikhil@medianama.com: He didn't have an answer to one question: where would those people go, which no state wants?
[2024-05-20, 11:52:15] ~ nikhil@medianama.com: Good to see you Rajiv. It's been, what, 12-13 years. ☺️
[2024-05-20, 11:54:23] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: People do immigrate, but the state chooses whom to allow. It’s based on rule set by each state, like algorithm. I'm sure many are using actual algorithms for security reasons to do it.
[2024-05-20, 13:06:03] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: This is true. But we need to be clear about which safeguards technologists can (and should) build in themselves, and which ones should be prescribed by law, which in some cases will go against commercial interests. I think finding that balance will be key for India, given limited state capacity

[2024-05-20, 14:14:21] Vamshi: I like this manner of questioning the legitimacy of accepted institutions even though I only partly agree with some of what’s said here. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-20, 14:20:30] Vamshi: The manner of leadership for sovereign entities that’s accepted today is a combination of demagoguery, force and ruthlessness.

Even in commerce where we’re supposedly pursuing the capitalist ideal of “no physical force”, the use of leverage to establish leadership in ways that suppress finer human aspirations for mere increases in the sphere of influence and scale of impact (interplanetary or more modest earthly ambitions alike), is a slightly refined variant of the need to dominate.
[2024-05-20, 14:30:00] Vamshi: The impact on quality of disease free life, life extension and mastery over the forces of nature is often projected as the ultimate fruit of a rational and scientific civilisation.

But without accepting the need for a philosophical foundation that necessitates any plausible need to exist as living beings, the cultural bankruptcy of the ostensibly scientific modern mind eventually gets subverted by institutions like the sovereign state that are dominated by flawed value systems that subvert and co-opt attempts at “finer human aspirations” to create divisive narratives that create the very factions that necessitate the need for a democracy.
[2024-05-20, 14:37:32] Vamshi: Far from being anti-technology, I think this is a call for action to reinvent the cultural aspirations born of the highest states of human existence, which, far from being about the mastery over the forces of nature, are about mastery over the plausible purpose of agency.

If I were to be parochial enough to take on an Indian identity for a bit and stand beneath “humanity”, we as a culture have learnt to become ashamed of being the pioneers of this aspect of the human journey, and perhaps excusably so because of the pathetic attempts at establishing our “superiority” by clinging on to the ancient past, instead of renewing the journey with modern tools. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-20, 15:07:25] Prashant Singh JarApp: Cultures are not matters of taste but systems of adaptation to specific circumstances that may prove irrelevant or even counterproductive in other settings.the nation-state today has exhausted its possibilities. It is bankrupt, an institution grown to a senile extreme. Like the Church , it has served as the dominant form of social organization for five centuries. Having outlived theconditions that brought it into existence [gunpowder ,industrial revolution and sea farinf merchantile class ]  , it is ripe for a fall.
[2024-05-20, 15:08:09] Prashant Singh JarApp: There has always been a strong tendency for social systems to mimic the characteristics of prevailing technology. This is something that Marx got right. Gigantic factories coincided with the age of big government. Microprocessing is miniaturizing institutions.
[2024-05-20, 15:09:36] Prashant Singh JarApp: “access creates globalism, and globalism disrupts political systems by making the concept of borders obsolete.As borders disappear, the concept of taxation, which supports governments, becomes increasingly fragile.… As borders disappear, the concept of entitlement—the belief that because you were born in a particular place, you are entitled to the economic advantages associated with that place—falls apart, and as it falls apart, the perks of nationhood fall apart with it. And as all that happens, the ideals that underlie nationhood—patriotism,democracy, the state, the melting pot, unification, responsible participation, whatever they happen to be in
whatever nation one is living in—get relegated to the junk heap of history

The simple fact is that the larger sense of patriotism—a love of nation, a sense of filial duty to it—will not be  a particularly useful predisposition in 100 years or so
[2024-05-20, 15:11:19] Prashant Singh JarApp: like Anotnio G Martineze says " Culture and Politics are downstream of economics . All three are downstream of technology "
[2024-05-20, 15:14:08] Vamshi: It’s very interesting to view this statement itself as born of a cultural viewpoint.

The question of values is about the ends and the means.

We’ve had similar humorous conversations on this topic in the past related to evolution 😅 ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-20, 15:14:18] Vamshi: Is technology the means or the end ? ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-20, 15:14:28] Vamshi: If so is culture the driver or the driven
[2024-05-20, 15:25:11] Prashant Singh JarApp: Nether : Culture in emergent .. it emerges in a cetain condition and goes away .
[2024-05-20, 15:26:56] Prashant Singh JarApp: politicians ,kings and founders like us to believe that they "engineer" the culture but their contribution is marginal at best ... culture happen becuase its time for it to happen .

[2024-05-20, 15:29:32] Vamshi: So yeah this comes full circle and it appears we have the exact same standpoint then
[2024-05-20, 15:29:54] Vamshi: As when I responded to your original quote
[2024-05-20, 15:30:23] Vamshi: Factions are created by the “residual noise” of rational decision making
[2024-05-20, 15:30:40] Vamshi: Which is often the blind spot for any automated system of governance
[2024-05-20, 15:33:28] Vamshi: I guess the evolution pointed to is that technology is enabling more “rational” decision making and that we will subsume all the factions represented by geographical affiliation with economic ones instead, and that even further down we will subsume all the economic ones with a “super governance”. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-20, 15:38:27] Prashant Singh JarApp: Not sure about that .
[2024-05-20, 15:43:09] Vamshi: Another approach to the conversation is to classify conflict a bit further?

[2024-05-20, 17:26:50] Prashant Singh JarApp: underlying assumption in your statment is that cultural changes are triggered by a temporal event and accumlate momentum... but the fact is cultural change happen on a continum , on a glacial pace.  temporal /local event is a fallacy perpetuated by myth builder . any anthorpologist / ethnographer will tell you that when it comes to societal changes : Actors are always accidental .
[2024-05-20, 17:29:26] Prashant Singh JarApp: take example of Tahrir Square protest in Egypt . Which was started when a google employee created a facebook page . they take a lot of PR milegae in the name of "restoring democracy " but they havent restor democracy in Saudi Arabia or Singapore or China yet .  But the truth is Tahrir square happned becuase food price inflation . Essential food price raise > 200% in less than a years time . People become more hungry than scared
[2024-05-20, 17:31:31] Prashant Singh JarApp: same goes for what happned in Chauri Chaura during Fredom struggle ...and Samke is happening now in our country as unrest and dissatisfaction toward the policy of incumbent government is coming out. Kejriwal and Rahul gandhi might want to take credit of "triggering " that but fact is result would have been more or less same even without all there drama
[2024-05-20, 17:33:18] Prashant Singh JarApp: Read: My white boses in Bay area haven't given me mandate to invest in foundational model. only on application level stuff.

"Hemant Mohapatra, Partner, Lightspeed, reflecting on their global experience in funding leading GenAI ventures, remarked, "Having backed some of the most influential names in GenAI globally, we are excited by Sarvam AI’s unique approach in combining model innovation and application development to build population-scale solutions for India." https://www.sarvam.ai/blog/announcing-our-41m-series-a-investment
[2024-05-20, 17:53:02] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: But Lightspeed has invested in Sarvam AI. 
My first intuition upon seeing this article is that it is taken out of context. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-20, 17:54:26] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Good catch. So what’s happening here? Is Sarvam the exception to the rule that India can’t build model or are VCs saying one thing about India but doing another
[2024-05-20, 17:55:23] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: He's saying India does not have the compute and talent.
[2024-05-20, 17:56:05] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Tales upwards of 100 M to build foundational models
[2024-05-20, 17:56:25] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Sarvam is an AI agent company now I guess like Alteria
[2024-05-20, 17:57:50] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Specialising in Indic language use cases
[2024-05-20, 17:58:32] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: VCs can solve capital issues. But what’s the reasoning behind the Sarvam investment if there is a compute and talent constraint? My question is this - is Sarvam the exception in that regard - they can access compute and have the talent in ways other Indian companies don’t? Or are VCs just hedging their bets
[2024-05-20, 18:02:44] Nirant K: Yes to both - they've unfair access to some degree
[2024-05-20, 18:10:00] Ravi Theja: Just curious, why would someone raise 41M when one is not building FM? 🤔
[2024-05-20, 18:10:12] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: More than talent, we don’t have incentive to train foundation model. I’m sure tomorrow if there is an embargo or emergency, we will figure out how to train and train something like DBRX level, but that would be for national security not for building startup.
[2024-05-20, 18:12:28] Anubhav mishra Zupay: We can’t produce a large frontier model. It’s not just about foundation model.
[2024-05-20, 18:13:46] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: we can not produce frontier tech in mostly any thing that has to do with research.
[2024-05-20, 18:14:22] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Anyone working on frontier tech will move to US with O1 or EB1
[2024-05-20, 18:14:22] Anubhav mishra Zupay: But on the contrary whatever will be the definition of a Sovereign AI systems in the future atleast something should be thought on those lines
[2024-05-20, 18:14:39] Anubhav mishra Zupay: It can be a sovereign compute cluster or a model or whatever
[2024-05-20, 18:14:54] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Or even system of agents
[2024-05-20, 18:16:08] Anubhav mishra Zupay: It’s going to be much like Nuckear arsenal if not that than atleast Space research

[2024-05-20, 18:50:12] Prashant Singh JarApp: kyu?
[2024-05-20, 19:03:30] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Because frontier models will always chase AGI 

I’m actually of the sad opinion that that will be dominated by OAI. Google. Meta.

[2024-05-20, 20:25:45] Vamshi: I find it an interesting combination of people acting on an unlikely hunch / instincts ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-20, 20:26:19] Vamshi: Wonder if there’s anything to  learn from their collaboration for a Scenius such as this
[2024-05-20, 20:27:27] Vamshi: From Wikipedia : 

“After dropping out of university at 19, Suleyman helped start the Muslim Youth Helpline[8][9] with his university friend Mohammed Mamdani,[7] a telephone counselling service. The organization would later become one of the largest mental health support services for Muslims in the UK.[7]
Suleyman subsequently worked as a policy officer on human rights for Ken Livingstone, the Mayor of London, before going on to start Reos Partners, a ‘systemic change’ consultancy that uses methods from conflict resolution to navigate social problems. As a negotiator and facilitator, Mustafa worked for a wide range of clients such as the United Nations, the Dutch government, and the World Wide Fund for Nature.[10][11]”
[2024-05-20, 20:28:13] Vamshi: And then bam … DeepMind
[2024-05-20, 20:28:20] Vamshi: Don’t know what happened in between
[2024-05-20, 20:36:05] Vamshi: Sorry it does reference additional information to connect the dots. Still very interesting.

https://www.wired.com/story/deepmind/
[2024-05-20, 20:37:01] Vamshi: It mentions that he was indirectly connected to Hassabis in high school
[2024-05-20, 20:39:31] Vamshi: Anyway the point here was to bring out the manner in which there are unlikely collaborations and cross pollination which happens in areas where there’s innovation, and some of the outcomes we recognise as top notch today are similarly heterogenous.

'Self-Regulation' doesn't work, apparently.
[2024-05-21, 10:19:26] Tanuj Bhojwani: I don’t think Sarvam is in the same business as OpenAI, Llama and Gemini. They’re making custom models, yes. But not *foundational* models. Sarvam launched their product demo at our event. @917737887058 was there. Their tagline was - Your AI, Your Control. Fine tuned, on-prem (or private-cloud, or azure-hosted whatever client prefers) versions of these foundational models with indic language capabilities and tons of other easy to build features deployed for your org. Video will be out end of this week (if my editor so deems).
[2024-05-21, 10:20:46] Tanuj Bhojwani: Full context is my panel with Hemant. About 1:08 here : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t3RWNP7VPmQ
[2024-05-21, 10:21:01] Tanuj Bhojwani: Sarvam is doing something different, as I said above
[2024-05-21, 10:21:36] Tanuj Bhojwani: Because they can. When it comes to fundraising, you take what you get!
[2024-05-21, 10:22:30] Tanuj Bhojwani: thanks. this is probably a more precise language. I’m going to start using this.
[2024-05-21, 10:23:42] Tanuj Bhojwani: This is true. This goes back to my 2 wheeler metaphor. This is an oped I’ll be writing. To make that oped better, anyone who’d be willing to help me with the counter view? What’s the case for a large frontier agi chasing model for india. What will it cost, and where will that money come from?
[2024-05-21, 10:24:53] ~ Abhinash Khare: so are they still planning work with & contribute to open source or its mainly working with businesses now?
[2024-05-21, 10:27:59] Tanuj Bhojwani: You should ask them! They're on these groups and active. But their stated vision is sarvam - ai for all. I don't think they'll stray too far from that but everyone needs to keep the lights on. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-21, 10:29:40] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: What’s the difference between a frontier model and a foundation model? They are used interchangeable in policy language (see UK’ AI safety summit)
[2024-05-21, 10:34:50] Anubhav mishra Zupay: GPT 4 turbo is a frontier model. - llama3 70b is foundation model 

Frontier models are the most advanced models. A frontier model will always be a foundation model 

Mid journey V6 is a frontier model DALLE 3 Is a foundation model
[2024-05-21, 10:49:33] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Thanks Tanuj! I resonate with the approach of going User first rather than “Tech/Infra” first in building for India.

We did this with multiple technologies before and it worked well.
We did not invent “Internet” but we adopted it, modified for India and scaled it to India (Jio)
We did not invent “App Store” or “Play Store”, but we adopted it, built Apps for India (Swiggy, Meesho, PhonePe) and also built level 2 infra (like UPI, ONDC) and scaled to India.

More & more parallels can be drawn. Same approach we can take with AI.

[2024-05-21, 11:03:09] Tanuj Bhojwani: @919945194380 has agreed to take this up. Anyone else? I can even pitch it as a view, counter-view in bigger publications.
[2024-05-21, 11:16:22] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: So is the difference the scale or capability of the model, or something else, like the intent to build AGI? I think there’s an assumption that AGI can only be achieved through very large ‘frontier’ models as you call it, but I think that assumption can be broken if we continue to see increased compute efficiency and capabilities in smaller models
[2024-05-21, 11:18:52] Anubhav mishra Zupay: It really dosent matter if it’s large or small a frontier model is a model which is no.1 on most benchmarks. Easiest definition I think
[2024-05-21, 11:19:01] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Hard disagree with this. This line of thinking stems from a fundamental misreading of what GenAI is. It's not Y2K, iOS, cloud, etc. Those playbooks wont work with GenAI. 

GenAI is a labor replacement tech. Any and every mental, physical labor can be replaced with GenAI, eventually. We are seeing the first signs with BPO/BPM job losses. Where will those guys go? The same thing is gonna happen with software devs in a few years. 

We need new playbooks to deal with GenAI.
[2024-05-21, 11:22:10] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Ok thanks, the problem statement is clearer to me now. The argument is that india will build some foundational models but not models that are no 1 on most benchmarks (ie a frontier model).
[2024-05-21, 11:23:05] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Maybe. Say no to anything I guess
[2024-05-21, 11:25:39] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Okay. I get your line of thoughts. 
I really don’t know what will BPO/BPM people will do. They will really lose jobs. 
I have some intuition that software jobs will not go away, rather than become 10x, but that’s a separate thing.

But when I am talking about average Indian - I am talking about Kirana store owner in India who is struggling how to do make the best Phamphlet for marketing in local areas. 
I am talking about an old woman in tier 3 who does not understand how does smart phone/keyboard works. They only know how to speak in their local language.

Those people will love the AI. and existing open GenAI tech (Bhashini, LLama3, Stable Diffusion) - it will work well for these use-cases. We don’t need frontier tech to solve such simple use-cases.

[2024-05-21, 12:19:53] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: That’s why I am extremely happy that India is buying 10K GPUs.

[2024-05-21, 12:24:27] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Intelligence will the single biggest digital public good imo
[2024-05-21, 12:33:00] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: The government needs to have capability to train some kind of models for national security. VCs care about returns. Also, I think this way, 42-50M are not enough to train foundational model, and our investors may not have capacity to invest more. So tomorrow, let’s say we have few people who figure out to train the best models, either they will have to work for future version of ISRO, or move to the west. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-21, 12:35:58] Tanuj Bhojwani: Can you explain the value of that differential over just using open source pre trained models?

[2024-05-21, 12:37:07] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: If there is an AI AGI embargo and FB is stopped from releasing llama4. We can't keep moving forward on based on Llama3 for ever.
[2024-05-21, 12:38:22] Tanuj Bhojwani: Fair enough. And at that point the investment into this will be justified. It's riskier than having capability inhouse. But execution of building that capability is also risky (and costly).
[2024-05-21, 12:39:35] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: For national security, there needs to be some investment from government as our economy is not big enough to let private companies build and monetize frontier model race.
[2024-05-21, 12:40:46] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: We can keep asking Russia to send our satellites or build rockets at ISRO, even though it may be not be SpaceX or NASA but it still works well, according to our standards.

[2024-05-21, 12:48:24] Tanuj Bhojwani: I do think we need to be pragmatic. A strong enough solar flare can destroy all electronics and make this whole AI/AGI point moot.
[2024-05-21, 12:49:26] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Actually, that is not possible. Enough research has been done that say solar flare can not knock down electronics. 😬
[2024-05-21, 12:49:33] Tanuj Bhojwani: But we have to draw the line somewhere that makes sense. I don't disagree with resilience. But pouring hundreds of millions/billions on the sovereignty piece needs to be weighed against what else!

[2024-05-22, 09:40:03] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: I hope India go into this negotiation with a strong arm 💪
[2024-05-22, 09:42:01] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Out of curiosity, why does the Indian government need model weights to be open from a sovereignty perspective?
[2024-05-22, 09:42:26] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: We have been licensing 30yr old Jet engines cause we can't build them. While China is copy pasting even B2 bombers. It won't end well, and DC will control negotiations, not Meta.

[2024-05-22, 09:55:58] Tanuj Bhojwani: This is not news to me! It's also a fair strategy. Keep something to commercialise.
[2024-05-22, 09:57:29] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Then, it is a calculated risk to be always under the influence of the US gov when the AI race accelerates.

[2024-05-22, 12:22:05] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Two scenarios:
1) There are equally performant models for all sorts of use (civil or defence) which has not been developed by Indian govt. In this case there is a dependency that tomorrow we don’t have model weights because we have been using some API. (Highly unlikely though) Sovereignty immediately get’s compromised. 

2) There are models that Indian govt. has bought for all sorts of use cases (civil or defence) and has been shared model weights as well - so now 10k GPUs can be consumed and the model can be used. But the govt. doesnt have access to training procedure or the base data used to train. The model get’s stale and govt. is vendor locked. Sovereignty is at mild risk but from a competitive edge perspective not a good place to be at.

3) There are models that Indian govt. has bought/developed or the has received along with base data, training procedure and model weights. Govt. will have to ensure that there is upkeep and maintenance but it is still in control. Sovereignty remains some what intact but the onus on ensuring that it is not a sunk cost comes back to the govt.

[2024-05-22, 18:36:53] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: I’m sure Zucks phone is ringing with all sorts of powerful ppl making all kinds of plays to ensure this
[2024-05-22, 18:38:00] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Something like GPT-4o is way too powerful to open source just like that
[2024-05-22, 18:43:58] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Where will BPO folks go ? I’m pretty sure Infy etc can do 10x of what scale AI is currently doing. Can move to data annotation , production , evaluation. Will also help build domestic models
[2024-05-22, 18:44:44] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: The same ppl answering support calls with some training can create data
[2024-05-22, 18:44:53] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: But it will be a much smaller number
[2024-05-22, 19:27:08] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Infy, TCS etc. are applying the cloud playbook to GenAI. They're "certifying" their employees as GenAI ready and selling AI transformation projects to US clients. TCS just bagged a billion dollar project.
[2024-05-22, 19:27:46] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: If they are building datasets/models, they're not doing it in public at least.

[2024-05-22, 19:48:24] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Accenture numbers were commitments or pilot projected to earn that much, and TCS assuming they are comparing is also saying the same. AIM folks are amazing. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-22, 19:48:54] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: it mentions airline, security, etc.
[2024-05-22, 19:49:16] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: There is not a single company except big tech that will spend 1B on a single GenAI project
[2024-05-22, 19:50:16] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Also, these numbers were not pure GenAI but part of their digital transformation package.
[2024-05-22, 19:51:16] ~ Tapan: Interesting 🤔
[2024-05-22, 19:58:32] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Assuming if TCS, Accenture, Infy are applying the cloud transformation playbook, they must be marketing their "GenAI ready workforce" to all the non core IT sector: BFSI, Pharma, Healthcare, etc.
[2024-05-22, 20:02:34] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Many CIOs are under pressure to experiment with GenAI to cut costs, increase productivity, because of the "challenging economic conditions". Probably the VC funds pouring money going into Gen AI startups also are pushing for it.
[2024-05-22, 20:06:25] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: That's how they're filling up their pipelines. But, there's price pressure though. These guys are the biggest MS Copilot users. And MS has been touting the 50% productivity gains.
[2024-05-22, 20:12:22] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Reminds me of Infosys AusOpen sponsorship 

They heavily branded AusOpen with Infy AI
As part of promotion they hosted a text-2-imgmodel so users can generate graffiti for Nadal.

Turns out that they hosted a bunch of pre-generated images and kept serving those via cdns whenever anyone entered a prompt.
[2024-05-22, 22:09:23] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Indias goal should be simple in short term 
- A 7 B / 14B multi modal LLM that can do voice text and image understanding in top 10 Indian languages
[2024-05-22, 22:15:18] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: Any idea how much compute that would require in terms of GPUs or PF?
[2024-05-22, 22:30:11] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: I think it would cost on the order of millions of dollars 🤔
[2024-05-22, 22:30:15] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Quite doable
[2024-05-22, 22:33:37] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Calculating in PF isn’t straightforward. See this: https://medium.com/@dzmitrybahdanau/the-flops-calculus-of-language-model-training-3b19c1f025e4

I am pretty sure better resources exist but this has a decent explanation
[2024-05-22, 22:35:11] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Also you should factor for multiple runs. LLM gods need to bless you before you get your model.
[2024-05-22, 22:53:24] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Starting with some LAMA as a base + changing tokenizer and then up cycling maybe a shortcut . I tnink that’s what many GPU poor startups do

[2024-05-22, 23:16:48] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: At least somebody's talking about labour replacement. The next few years are gonna be wild.
[2024-05-23, 09:29:34] ~ Sandya Saravanan: In the Build Keynote, I think Rajesh Jha did mention Acenture, Tech Mahindra and a few others buying 100,000+ copilot licenses
[2024-05-23, 11:34:41] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: My hunch is this can be easily done with a portion of the 10k GPUs being acquired. Question is whether a 7b model can do the use cases that Indian wants and needs. I think this will be discovery process and some back and forth with devs to get the right parameters.(including on context windows etc) and the compute allocation right.
[2024-05-23, 11:34:53] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: But I’m feeling more confident that India can build a useful foundational model from scratch. What I like about this goal is that it’s clearly defined so resources can be invested accordingly (capex never an issue, more about compute and talent)
[2024-05-23, 11:54:24] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: MS is aggressively marketing copilot to enterprises. It's a blockbuster product. It's a problem for services companies though.
[2024-05-23, 11:55:19] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Clients are asking for discounts on the projects citing copilot. There's downward pressure on contract values.
[2024-05-23, 11:57:09] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: That's gonna push more adoption of GenAI tools. Copilots for PMs, meeting assistants, agents.

[2024-05-23, 14:12:53] Amlan Mohanty AI Policy: I would say publicly funded, but more importantly in the public interest (does that exclude commercial models, I don’t know). This gets to heart of “what is a sovereign model”. It’s a good research question, something I’m keen to explore
[2024-05-23, 14:14:27] Tanuj Bhojwani: If government, what you’re saying is you’re confident taxpayer money can be used to spin up GPUs to train a model of a certain size. I am confident about that too. However this model will not exist in a vacuum, this model will be competing with other models. I’m less confident of what happens after. What’s your take on that? The Abu Dhabi government also trained falcon-34B. A few months down the line, how is it being used, by whom and for what?
[2024-05-23, 14:22:27] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: In terms of adaptation and competitive edge, there will be only 2-3 winners in the model race anyway. The sovereign models are more about national security and developing applications for surveillance, security, etc. A good analogy can be a commercial plane vs a Jet fighter.

[2024-05-23, 15:24:17] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Similarly Bloomberg trained Bloombger GPT by spending $10mm and there is no evidence of why that is better  than any other model.
[2024-05-23, 15:25:10] Saurabh Karn Nyai: That’s the tricky thing about LLMs it doesn’t work like that. You get some compute, some data and some training procedure - may or may not lead to a model usable.
[2024-05-23, 15:25:40] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Similar to like how education DOESNT work by just putting a teacher and students in a classroom
[2024-05-23, 15:25:56] Saurabh Karn Nyai: This one was unnecessary but something I think about
[2024-05-23, 15:30:54] Keertana S Suvy: And the key is , how to design education that substitutes for experience? Look at most new job posts related to AI , almost all ask for several years  experience working with AI  ( 5+ ) - demand clearly outstrips supply of labor here. How to fill the gap quickly, as new jobs emerge?

[2024-05-28, 21:47:50] Hasan Tech Art: Also with MoE becoming open with mixtral and some experimental 2b x 8 models. Seems like multiple small brains is actually the way to go.
[2024-05-28, 21:52:24] Hasan Tech Art: I have been collaborating with artists for a theatre show. It’ll be about the challenges of powerful AI tools in the context of online attacks on journalists and such. One of the parts have a fake tweet storm targeting one of the audience members. The tweets, names and usernames are being generated by a local LLM. Also another part where Audience member have to introduce themselves and we record that 30 seconds. In 10 minutes we ask the person to step out of the stage we will continue the show with a bot but with their face and voice 😁. The dialogue bot is saying are coming from a local LLM. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-05-31, 11:35:02] Nirant K: Hello friends, as you might've noticed that we remove folks from the community because of WhatsApp limitation of 2K people — and we're oversubcribed at all times. This meant you'd have to be active in the main group even if you personally were more interested in Policy because the removal criteria only factored that group. That will change to allow activity in this group to count from June 1. 

Why? We want to encourage specialisation since Day 1. And it makes no sense to encourage contributing in an engineering forum if your heart lies elsewhere.

[2024-06-02, 14:17:18] ~ Shashank Shekhar: On AI Tshinghua is way ahead of not only Indian universities but any university in the world. While the list places CMU on 3rd, on number of publications in top ABDC listed journals and conferences, Tshinghua is way ahead. State of affairs in India is pretty disappointing. There is no encouragement for research for undergrads. For post grads and PhD too, the efforts are disparate and the institutions have very negligible role ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-06-02, 14:18:38] Nirant K: CMU places 3rd largely because of their "low resource language" hack to get published everywhere from language to vision these days 
[2024-06-02, 14:19:46] ~ Shashank Shekhar: We recently did a RAGathon at IIT M and the performance of the students (mostly undergrads) was pretty disappointing. Hardly any innovation or originality in thoughts
[2024-06-02, 14:20:02] C Chaitanya: When I was younger, I was more impressed with these numbers. Wanting to study in the "top 10" universities etc etc. Unfortunately have now become older and more disillusioned with rankings, numbers etc.
All I know is that money is not the only thing to define research. Especially for Math. All you need is an active, inquisitive mind. And one mentor who believes in you.
Some other kind of research might need huge investments for sure. There is no way around. But AI and math research, I still have hope that the best results will come from some corner by some obscure researcher.
[2024-06-02, 14:23:03] C Chaitanya: The main problem with Chinese universities, for me at atleast, is that their research most probably will not benefit humanity. It might benefit China. But that's not the same as benefitting humanity. I think in that ranking, it will rank pretty low.
[2024-06-02, 14:25:32] ~ Shashank Shekhar: I don’t completely agree. Give the current landscape and pace , infrastructure and investment will prove to be necessary for any significant innovation in this domain
[2024-06-02, 14:27:54] Nirant K: China is around 25% of humanity! And in fairness, China does ship it's surplus in most areas from battery innovation to textiles to rest of the world in past. It's unfair to say that it won't benefit humanity.

Asian manufacturing, shipping, coordination prowess has helped humanity grow from 3B to ~9B in less than 40 years. That's insane.
[2024-06-02, 14:28:27] Nirant K: I get the idea that China is often isolationist, but they're publishing in Western "open" venues for now
[2024-06-02, 14:36:58] C Chaitanya: Of course I have no problem with China spending money and doing research. Their country their money :)
But I was just pointing out that that may not be the best approach for our country at this stage. We cannot just invest $4B in one university so that we have a top ranking University in the world. Our current goal seems to be welfare schemes which will uplift people out of poverty. At least thats what people are voting for.
[2024-06-02, 14:38:56] C Chaitanya: It is more judicious for us to look at alternative forms of research that does not compete  directly with their research. We do not have the money, the compute or talent in that area to win.
