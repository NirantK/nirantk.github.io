[17/05/23, 10:03:38 AM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: Hello folks, 
It feels great to announce our 3 months progress here in a wider startup forum. In our very early journey, we have been to move the roadmap for businesses intelligence stack in a few startups and have a GTM insight for entry into enterprise businesses. We are based out of blr and approaching the overall theme of increasing business productivity from the data side. 

We have written to a few VCs in past few days, in case you didn't hear from me pls let me know. Shall do the needful. 

I also understand a lot of institutions are in initial phases of building a stance for AI in BI tools, happy to exchange notes, otherwise too. 

Nirant thanks for the setting up these forums. Very helpful! Will try to keep the bar high. 🇮🇳🌎

Shashwat,
Representing team consumableai

[17/05/23, 12:26:08 PM] Anubhav Mishra AI: A good one!
[18/05/23, 12:25:16 PM] Aditya Agrawal: What is the biggest GPU size you guys have used for training/fine tuning model? We are using 64GB and still running out of memory. Would highly appreciate any help in the regard .
[18/05/23, 1:14:43 PM] Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni: What’s the size of the model?
[18/05/23, 1:26:19 PM] Aditya Agrawal: DM'd you :)
[24/05/23, 10:40:32 AM] Aditya Agrawal: Welcome @19377081307 , Pratik is building KisaanGPT
[24/05/23, 10:45:39 AM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: Could be a memory leak as well during the forward/backward pass? Might have to tune the parameters
[24/05/23, 10:49:16 AM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: I had the same issue while training using LoRA, no matter how big the gpu it used to give OOM
[24/05/23, 10:52:13 AM] Aditya Agrawal: when we tried with reduced batch size it worked.
[24/05/23, 10:52:49 AM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: It is still a suboptimal fix if it can hold bigger batches
[24/05/23, 10:54:49 AM] Aditya Agrawal: True..
[24/05/23, 1:09:18 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Thanks Aditya
[25/05/23, 3:31:38 AM] Dev Aggarwal AI: Congratulations on the 50k users @19377081307 !
[25/05/23, 3:40:27 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Thanks 🙏. 0.01% of people that we can affect, but small small victories are motivating.
[25/05/23, 4:48:34 AM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: Congratulations indeed. 50k users on kisaangpt shud be celebrated. But curious why you say 0.01% (total farmers in India ~150Mn)
[25/05/23, 4:58:18 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Kissan = Peasant, not just actual farmers

We are working on integrating finance, education and other domains that touches Bharat, with some large banks and companies reaching out.
India's rural and agriculture population, Bharat, is actually upwards to 800M+, also have been receiving request to spin off versions for Africa, South East Asia and South America, so the number may go really really high (Though, focusing on one thing at a time)
[25/05/23, 5:11:26 AM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: education not so sure bcz a lot of these farmers have generational knowledge of know-how. But I feel finances is something that might attract em and hook for real. Saying this in the light of mgnrega and other finance schemes at that level
[25/05/23, 5:14:08 AM] Aditya Agrawal: 👏👏👏
[25/05/23, 5:15:08 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: What If I help them to find them suitable loan or scheme, best rates, give them steps and help through the entire process with backend banking API integration, without annoying man in the middle.
[25/05/23, 5:16:58 AM] Aditya Agrawal: Kisaan have high dependency on the traders who provide them loan and also have power to exploit them. There is definitely lot of information gap that exists. Pricing of paddy changes every hour. Payment terms are super variant as well..
[25/05/23, 5:17:41 AM] Aditya Agrawal: True
[25/05/23, 5:20:18 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: They (Gov, Farmers, Banks) want to bypass the traders/middleman and also the daily/weekly/payday loan culture (exported from US) is exploiting them a lot. It will take time, looking at the size of our country, but if AI can't solve it, who will?
[25/05/23, 5:23:02 AM] Aditya Agrawal: I am from chattisgarh and have strong connects in rice/paddy industry. Willing to find you a connect in rice association. In case that helps?
[25/05/23, 5:24:50 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: That would be very helpful. DMing.
[25/05/23, 7:37:44 AM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: Hey ecosystem, as you wud be aware we are building a genAI first business intelligence platform. I think it'd be cool to free up bandwidth by automating repetitive tasks which wasn't possible until the rise of AI. We are focusing on data analytics space and wanted to get diverse feedback from international markets. So am looking for 2-3 warm connects with US based founders or any decision maker in a big or small business. Pls let me know if anyone can connect us with relevant person. Wud be very helpful.
[25/05/23, 7:45:42 AM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: @919900577063 can definitely help with this
[25/05/23, 7:48:25 AM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: Very kind of you @919952465050 for nominating @919900577063 will wait to hear from him. Thank you.
[29/05/23, 11:36:51 AM] Shouvik Ghosh Roy Mosaic Wellness: Has anyone had any experience leverage ai generated videos to customise app based on user details for offline usage? For example leverage brand ambassador creatives to customise onboarding.
[29/05/23, 11:42:34 AM] Sudharshan Ai: Rephrase and Gan AI do this
[29/05/23, 11:43:01 AM] Sudharshan Ai: Are you looking for a product or need help implementing something like this?
[29/05/23, 12:07:06 PM] Shouvik Ghosh Roy Mosaic Wellness: Ideally would like to implement this in house. Happy to explore products if they help us move faster.
[29/05/23, 12:08:45 PM] Dev Aggarwal AI: Please try https://sadtalker.github.io and let us know your experience! For me I couldn’t get it do aspect ratios right
[29/05/23, 12:13:11 PM] Sudharshan Ai: Check out heygen then (https://www.heygen.com/) - the ones I mentioned earlier have a heavy B2B focus

The founders might be in this group btw
[29/05/23, 12:13:38 PM] Sudharshan Ai: With heygen you can sign up and start using it asap
[29/05/23, 12:14:36 PM] Shouvik Ghosh Roy Mosaic Wellness: Thanks! Let me explore
[29/05/23, 12:16:28 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Would recommend this as well - have heard some encouraging feedback anecdotally
[29/05/23, 12:24:59 PM] Dev Aggarwal AI: Is the pricing not as insane as d-id?
[29/05/23, 12:26:12 PM] Sudharshan Ai: 30 USD for 10 mins
[29/05/23, 12:26:42 PM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: justbaat.com - they have partnered with lots of Indian news channel, and are pretty cheap
[29/05/23, 12:27:04 PM] Sudharshan Ai: Not too bad - considering what it can do. But yes pricey and from a business POV - juicy margins.
[29/05/23, 12:27:58 PM] Dev Aggarwal AI: A100 costs like 1% of this. Sad talker would be a much better bet at any sort of scale
[29/05/23, 12:30:16 PM] Hari Sir: I use synthesia.io . I found it pretty easy and fast . Do not know if that is what you are looking for .
[29/05/23, 12:55:16 PM] Keertana Suvy AI: Hi friends, wanted to share an update-  The Suvy app's open beta version is now available to all on the google (India) play store:  https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.suvy.

The app provides school students a personal and safe AI powered tutor, instant doubt clearing and  custom learning adventures (syllabus specific quizzes and revisions) and exam preparation journeys in multiple languages, and in a gamified format. It is particularly useful for students in classes 6-10 to master science. We're working to improve it and add more features, so would love to hear any feedback or comments.

 Cheers! Keertana

[29/05/23, 2:15:21 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Langflix.ai team I am mentoring is able to get multiple aspect ratios right. But they are maintaining across the images and doing it in chunks. Haven’t talked to them for a while but I can check with them if they found something new.

[08/06/23, 9:44:24 AM] Sudharshan Ai: Hey folks, have a question on SaaS/AI SaaS profit margins and EBITDA. 

I run an AI product agency and we're taking on a client based in HK.

Apart from cash, I'm negotiating a percentage of the final rev-share, or I might be doing a profit-share with some equity. 

He mentioned profit margins are around 20% which seems way too low for me. Wondering if you have any thoughts on what the average profit margins for an AI SaaS are?
[08/06/23, 9:46:11 AM] Aditya Agrawal: @sudharshan in this group we do not appreciate agencies and consultants
[08/06/23, 9:46:19 AM] Aditya Agrawal: It’s product founders group
[08/06/23, 9:50:20 AM] Sudharshan Ai: Why is this an issue? I'm not selling anything. 

I'm asking a question that people here might have experience in since they have built/building AI products. 

I'm also building a text-to-video AI product for creators fyi.
[08/06/23, 9:50:59 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Perhaps have that written down somewhere? So that it's well known? 
[08/06/23, 9:51:28 AM] Aditya Agrawal: Because there is a huge audience of consultancy firms which start selling services to the group itself.
[08/06/23, 9:53:07 AM] Sudharshan Ai: Am I selling? If I was then it makes sense to call me out. 

I asked a question about AI profit margins and EBITDA. Something fundamental to any AI product/business. 

I'm asking a question that could encourage healthy discussions on this topic.
[08/06/23, 9:56:45 AM] Aditya Agrawal: I will move this to an offline discussion for a better resolution.
[08/06/23, 9:56:51 AM] Sudharshan Ai: Sure

It'll def be more interesting for the superusers to compare functionality/ accuracy/ usability. Try out the consumableai here @ https://platform.consumableai.com/ and let us both know which aspects you enjoyed more in which platform. 😊
[09/06/23, 9:00:53 AM] Nisha Vc Ai: @917507856760 please introduce yourself to other group members
[09/06/23, 6:37:03 PM] Aditya Agrawal: @919940474056 for average profit margin I believe 20-30% is industry standard
[09/06/23, 6:38:19 PM] Aditya Agrawal: Who has distribution keeps 30%
[09/06/23, 6:38:37 PM] Sudharshan Ai: Thanks, seems low?
[09/06/23, 6:38:44 PM] Sudharshan Ai: Okay, and the rest 70%?
[09/06/23, 6:40:12 PM] Aditya Agrawal: So I’ll give an example: we have our AI offering which anyone can embed on their platform or to the existing customer. And we are perpetually happy to give 30% of revenue to them.
[09/06/23, 6:41:49 PM] Aditya Agrawal: But in general for a SAAS product margin should be around 80%
[09/06/23, 6:42:46 PM] Aditya Agrawal: Anyone from VC ecosystem who would like to take that?
[09/06/23, 6:42:53 PM] Aditya Agrawal: @919952465050 ?
[09/06/23, 6:44:53 PM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: I have no context of the conversation 😅
[09/06/23, 6:48:07 PM] Aditya Agrawal: @919940474056 : please feel free to jump in case required. Will AI SAAS profit margin be very different than SAAS profit margin?
[09/06/23, 6:48:19 PM] Aditya Agrawal: If yes, then how much?
[09/06/23, 6:49:41 PM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: Till now we have seen it to be at this. We can chat on DM about this
[09/06/23, 8:40:39 PM] Sudharshan Ai: Will do thanks
[10/06/23, 4:53:53 AM] Aditya Agrawal: My friend runs www.vidyo.ai  and they have been doing great business. I can request him a session on this. They have 0 CAC . I can also check with Sanket who runs Invideo

[10/06/23, 7:27:34 AM] Aishwarya Goel AI: Could be different for AI companies because of heavy infra cost.. 

https://a16z.com/2020/02/16/the-new-business-of-ai-and-how-its-different-from-traditional-software-2/

This study says AI companies are at 50-60% margin
[10/06/23, 7:29:24 AM] Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni: Today infra is the biggest cost for an AI company
[10/06/23, 7:29:49 AM] Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni: So that will definitely hurt their margins in the short term till infra costs get amortised
[10/06/23, 7:35:01 AM] Brij Singh Rebright Partners: This is me. We have started building a broad coalition of partners around this and have  an active working group.  

If anyone is interested to contribute in an OSS mechanism, please DM me and I can share further details.

[10/06/23, 8:12:49 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Things are getting out of control and context, but good that he lit fire. At least now more people will know the difference between fine tuning and the foundation models.
[10/06/23, 8:32:23 AM] Aditya Agrawal: Dm'd you
[10/06/23, 8:32:54 AM] Aditya Agrawal: Have been discussing this for long.
[10/06/23, 9:12:51 AM] Sumod Mohan Ai: Thanks for this write up Brij and great to see you all put in substantial money as well to help build foundations. Two cents, we have had revolutions even in this Generation of AI, first came CNNs, RNNs and then Transformers. So there is some likelihood that there will new type of models too, that will allow smaller more compact models. This was true earlier too, when ANN flourished they then got replaced by SVMs. US puts lots of money both in academic research of flavours and Industry taking bets in those (DeepMind:RL, OpenAI:CNN/Transformers, AllenAI, Vicarious:Prob models, Ayasdi: Topological models etc) and so on. If we want to be ahead, we as an ecosystems will have to take those calculated risks I feel. We probably should work on what the next models could be, not just trying to reach parity.

[03/07/23, 6:33:58 PM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: https://signal.nfx.com/investor-lists/top-ai-seed-investors
[03/07/23, 6:46:27 PM] Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai: Hi Ankesh ... Im looking to invest in AI middleware companies.. prayank@accel.com
[03/07/23, 7:15:49 PM] Ankesh Atlasian AI: I meant the parallels of dynatrace/ moogsoft/ bigpanda
[03/07/23, 7:40:20 PM] Hemant Mohapatra Lightspeed Ai: I'm sure there are several investors looking at this category so, for the right team, there should be plenty of interest. I've been looking at MLops startups across India and US since 2017 but frankly it's a tough area with plenty of OSS tools and no big success after a decade of trying. From Michelangelo to fblearner to airflow to various cloud native tools and 100s more, the MLOps category unfortunately got too fragmented based on different tastes of different data science teams. What's interesting about LLMops is that it seems to be much closer and integrated to the enterprise data stack today than ML ever was -- and therefore likely to align to more standardized practices -- so I'm more hopeful for this category. We've made one adjacent investment here at lightspeed and happy to see more.
[03/07/23, 7:42:09 PM] Sudharshan Ai: That’s a nice observation
[03/07/23, 7:47:16 PM] Dhruv Anand: related: is there an open-source tool that is close to fblearner?
[03/07/23, 7:53:04 PM] Ankesh Atlasian AI: Sorry for the confusion, I understand the term AI Ops can be confused with ML Ops which is more popularly known. AI Ops was a term coined by Gartner to categorise the capability of using AI in the IT Ops or Devops realm(like for incident detection, fault localisation, etc) whereas ML Ops is the domain of Operating ML workloads.
[03/07/23, 7:55:28 PM] Ankesh Atlasian AI: Some example companies playing in the AI Ops domain are moogsoft, bigpanda, dynatrace, datadog, servicenow
[03/07/23, 9:19:56 PM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: Fblearner is nothing but a feature store and facebook scale. Every company has a feature store nowadays.
[03/07/23, 9:21:30 PM] Dhruv Anand: I meant the whole model lifecycle management (particularly cloning flows, click to start training job, model lineage, data selection). I know mlflow does some of this but it seems very barebones.
[03/07/23, 9:22:22 PM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: Databricks enterprise version has whole of it since 2020, we used it actively at my previous company
[03/07/23, 9:37:36 PM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: Profound. "In some of our earliest work to leverage AI and ML — such as delivering the most relevant content to each person — we noticed that the *largest improvements in accuracy* often came from quick experiments, feature engineering, and model tuning rather than applying fundamentally different algorithms"

[03/07/23, 9:47:12 PM] Sumod Mohan Ai: 2c: We had used DVC and datalad at different times. Datalad is great if you use git-annex, it is great for data provence, model tracking etc but no flows, atleast that is my memory. One click etc were mostly thin layers on top. Automated gsheets sheets (basically touch a particular cell and an experiment is automatically run on cloud). Over time we figured out Excel sheets were best for our usecase, this is about about 20+ projects + upto few 1000 experiments per project. Excel sheet was great because we could pivot on important characteristics etc. We sort of had the feel of what Quora described about their CI/CD deployment, people doing all sorts of experiments now that it was super easy to do. DVC also supports basic flows etc. Don't know enough about details FBlearner's  flows to compare.
[03/07/23, 9:48:34 PM] Sumod Mohan Ai: Would love to hear what others use.
[03/07/23, 9:59:05 PM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: AB testing everything is the reason meta products have no taste (personal opinion)
[03/07/23, 10:09:59 PM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: hmm. But whatsapp, instagram seems fine. Even though they moved Reels button noticeably many times, capability to change the icon in such a short timelines per user, does highlight that. We all know Airbnb is another example of exploiting experimentation.

I began my career at Adwyze (now Clarisights), a small 10-member company where I played a crucial role in building a 360 tool for automating performance marketing reporting. Later, I joined Intercom, in Dublin, Ireland as a Product Engineer, collaborating with cross-functional teams to deliver user facing products. After that, I had the privilege of being the first founding Engineer at Equals, where I helped build a core spreadsheet product that connects to live data from various sources. Since March I have been tinkering around different ideas in GenAI. I started a product called Clamy, which was chat on your own pdf, links and other documents. Idea was to just get introduced to the space. Later shut it down to focus on something more long term. Passionate about the potential of AI to revolutionize how teams work, making them more efficient.

[05/07/23, 5:45:37 PM] ~ Pratiksha | Graphia.AI: Should search (where people search for facts and correct answers) even be solved by generative AI (which hallucinates and makes up its own stories)?
[05/07/23, 5:47:00 PM] Ankesh Atlasian AI: ‎This message was deleted.
[05/07/23, 5:48:11 PM] Ankesh Atlasian AI: Glean delivers a combination of search and chat interface on search results using GenAI. It doesn't solve search using GenAI, right?
[05/07/23, 5:49:09 PM] ~ Pratiksha | Graphia.AI: I haven't used it. The website has a header - "search with generative AI you can trust"
[05/07/23, 5:49:43 PM] ~ Pratiksha | Graphia.AI: I assumed it meant the same usage as people use chatgpt's interface for searching internet
[05/07/23, 5:50:01 PM] Ankesh Atlasian AI: Not at the moment but I have built many of the building blocks of Glean at my workplaces.
[05/07/23, 5:52:23 PM] ‪+91 95913 74691‬: yeah that's correct
[05/07/23, 9:25:20 PM] Neha Nupoor Yc: We had Glean at Uber(my prev workpalce), its a doc search, did not give answers, but used to give documents that were closest. Afaik, glean came out of FB's research team that improved text search. But with current wave, there might as well be a chat interface now
[05/07/23, 9:26:44 PM] ‪+91 95913 74691‬: is uber not using it anymore? They recently added the answers engine
[05/07/23, 9:27:38 PM] ‪+91 95913 74691‬: Curious did people use it a lot at work? I have had mixed feedback that people actually don't use it. However I know the director of UX there she says otherwise though but she's biased. 🙂
[05/07/23, 9:27:48 PM] Neha Nupoor Yc: Hi All,
I am Neha. I was previously at Uber & Directi, currently building FiddleCube AI to fine tune models with low-resource datasets. We were in previous YC batch, and are currently building our product out of SF. My co-founder is also my husband, which has been interesting so far.
Happy to connect with folks here.

https://www.linkedin.com/in/nehanupoor/
[05/07/23, 9:29:06 PM] Neha Nupoor Yc: At Uber, we have uSearch which was life & blood. Glean was much better than that. We had to actively use it because it was really hard to know what was going on in other orgs and teams and to figure out one pagers, ppts etc
[05/07/23, 9:29:31 PM] Neha Nupoor Yc: I'm not at Uber anymore so can't say. But it is still there afaik.
[05/07/23, 9:29:40 PM] ‪+91 95913 74691‬: Got it. thanks for the insight
[05/07/23, 10:36:47 PM] ‪+91 90548 13551‬: Ankit here. My co-founder and i are starting a multi-gaming platform (tiktok for gaming). And we were exploring gen AI as a solution to a problem (creating hypercasual small games) we might face at scale. So, I am exploring people/funds who have gone through/are going through similar things. VCs focusing on gen AI are a huge help for me to network. We are releasing the mvp by August end, and we would need to raise money after that. Any sort of networking would help a lot

I’m Karan Gandhi
A second year CSE undergrad 

1Bn+ visas issues every year 
Rejections are somewhere in a few 10s Mn 

Most rejections happen due to incorrect information
A lot of them is due to correct info filled in the wrong slot
So mapping applications and their fields. 

Then filling them after asking for info in a text box using an app (comfortable to people)

If something looks off, asking form fillers to check again, this uses some trained model

Eventually looking to build a simple process where you store your details with us (on your device, not servers) and just enter where you want to go + where you will stay
And we do the paperwork ourselves


Very raw at the moment
Looking for ideas 
Was looking to acquire travel agencies as customers to do pilot + testing

Happy to talk more about this and understand where you see gaps in this

[07/07/23, 7:16:31 PM] ~ Piyush Makhija: Hello everyone, This is Piyush 👋

Brief Intro:
I'm an alum of IITR and Georgia Tech. I have been applying my knowledge and skills in the realm of ML/AI over the past few years. My portfolio includes hands-on experience with designing NLP stacks for unconventional text and speech data, building chatbots to foster communication across various products, and creating propensity models for optimized operations and marketing. Additionally, I've had the opportunity to aid a few startups in implementing Generative AI capabilities. For more on my professional journey, please visit my LinkedIn profile: https://www.linkedin.com/in/piyushmakhija/

At present, I'm at the helm of an exciting venture - Moneyflo (https://www.moneyflo.ai/). Our mission is to serve as a strategic business co-pilot for e-commerce brands, empowering them to reach their maximum potential. I'm really looking forward to stimulating and insightful conversations within this group and potentially exploring avenues for collaboration.
[07/07/23, 7:22:07 PM] Bhavya e/acc: Intro?
[07/07/23, 7:25:24 PM] Bhavya e/acc: Do have a look at "Salad". Founder - Aruna Chawla.
[07/07/23, 7:31:40 PM] ‪+91 88980 20185‬: Bumping this up since a lot of founders have joined this grp since early June. Happy to be a super user if you need one. Feel free to reach out.
[07/07/23, 7:32:58 PM] Pranjal Mehta Code Hack: Haha thanks Divya
[07/07/23, 7:42:22 PM] ‪+91 95605 22239‬: Salad shut down if I remember correctly. 

We actually did a few experiments with them in sexual health space like role-plays etc. Was very interesting for us to to power good behavioural tracking. 

Happy to chat if relevant.
[07/07/23, 7:43:05 PM] Yash Bonde Ece 15: India. Up. Your. Game.
[07/07/23, 7:43:41 PM] Bhavya e/acc: Yes, that's why I mentioned. So that the founders can potentially avoid similar mistakes :)
[07/07/23, 7:43:55 PM] Bhavya e/acc: Was hesitant to mention it out loud. Thank you for pointing it out.
[07/07/23, 7:44:08 PM] ‪+91 95605 22239‬: We’re right opposite Bira Taproom. WorkHack, if you folks want to come over, happy to host GenAI founders.
[07/07/23, 7:45:04 PM] Bhavya e/acc: They raised a cumulative $270,000k pre-seed.
[07/07/23, 7:49:17 PM] ‪+91 95605 22239‬: Yup! I love Aruna’s energy though. Behaviour change, with or without gen AI,  products are hard, I respect her a lot.  

While working with enterprises, we love to help startups like ourselves experiment faster with conversational interfaces to focus on value delivery and real utility, instead of AI logistics.
[07/07/23, 7:51:25 PM] Bhavya e/acc: I have heard about Aruna's contagious energy from quite a few places. Would love to speak with her someday.

Regardless, my opinion is femtech in India is hard to crack.
[07/07/23, 7:51:48 PM] Bhavya e/acc: Your introduction?
[07/07/23, 7:52:11 PM] Bhavya e/acc: Sorry if I missed.
[07/07/23, 7:53:13 PM] ‪+91 95605 22239‬: Not sure if against the group guidelines to re-intro. But here you go 😅

I am Akshat, building WorkHack. We're a language AI company that helps enterprises deploy LLMs for building great customer experiences. Customers use WorkHack modules for usecases like Order Creation, Cancellation Reduction and Habit Formation. 

We've worked with over 10 large enterprises/startups in India and currently figuring out our US GTM. We're backed by Together Fund and Nexus VP. 

Excited to help in anyway I can, and learn from you all!

[11/07/23, 10:04:17 AM] Aditya Agrawal: www.Superu.ai ; ML/AI expertise. high level of ownership. self-driven.
[11/07/23, 10:06:50 AM] Aditya Agrawal: * I have always been a solo founder :)
[11/07/23, 10:15:59 AM] Divya Tak Ai: What made you want to look for a founder now
[11/07/23, 10:23:06 AM] Aditya Agrawal: There are like 100 + reasons to have a cofounder..
[11/07/23, 10:27:04 AM] Nirant Generative AI: What changed between Jan 2023 and now? xD
[11/07/23, 10:29:08 AM] Divya Tak Ai: Yea. Now being the operative word
[11/07/23, 10:30:18 AM] Aditya Agrawal: Nothing much I guess. I always wanted/want to add great people to the team. No doubts in that.  We just have more clarity on what we are building and need right set of people to drill down on and take ownership. and having the right person at the right time adds leaps and bounce.
[11/07/23, 10:33:57 AM] ~ Piyush Makhija: Have you looked at https://defog.ai/
very similar to what you are doing...
[11/07/23, 10:34:50 AM] Nirant Generative AI: I built a lot of the tech for defog.ai during Jan to Apr this year
[11/07/23, 10:34:54 AM] Hari Sir: I think a lot of things have changed since Jan 2023 of this year . Funding winter - followed by GAI which in my views has totally disrupted several SAAS and similar businesses . So out of the box thinkers are very important to add to founding teams as cofounders or as key hires - who can now commit to work on a specific problem / domain for the next 7-10 years . So it is a a good time to add fresh blood to founding teams . My 2c 😎
[11/07/23, 10:36:49 AM] ~ Piyush Makhija: Can you provide some details on what you built for them 😀
I'm guessing text2sql kind of things...?
[11/07/23, 10:36:57 AM] Nirant Generative AI: My controversial take is if I know a deep technical engineer who can be a co-founder, I'll refer him to a friend in SF not BLR. Because better outcomes across all relevant areas. 
[11/07/23, 10:37:09 AM] Nirant Generative AI: *refer them
[11/07/23, 10:37:38 AM] Aditya Agrawal: What if we were a SF based company?
[11/07/23, 10:38:15 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Yes, on-premise and GPT4 powered both. Mostly eval methods and sets because the founders are sharp and can do lot of the prompt work themselves
[11/07/23, 10:39:06 AM] Nirant Generative AI: idk what SF based means, but if you're selling and building in SF — that meets the criteria. If you've a single dev in India, that doesn't count.
[11/07/23, 10:41:26 AM] Aditya Agrawal: will learn from you deeply about it offline. Will help us with our next step.
[11/07/23, 10:46:04 AM] Pallav Nadhani: Adding controversy to your controversial take :) 1/ the “depth” & pool of engineers there in bay area is much higher, so founders there have a lot more / “better” option at hiring foundational / “core” engineering founder 2/ if problem statement to be solved is vertical & has india data/element, Indian founders may be better suited 3/ equal opportunities in terms of fund raising available both sides.
[11/07/23, 10:48:10 AM] Aditya Agrawal: "if problem statement to be solved is vertical & has india data/element, Indian founders may be better suited" Our problem statement is global.
[11/07/23, 10:48:37 AM] Aditya Agrawal: "equal opportunities in terms of fund raising available both sides." Havent looked into this side for a while now.
[11/07/23, 10:51:46 AM] Neha Nupoor Yc: Interesting. One of their challenges were to know when the model was trained enough
[11/07/23, 10:51:53 AM] Neha Nupoor Yc: Was that solved?
[11/07/23, 10:54:42 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Not completely, but lot of progress
[11/07/23, 10:55:13 AM] Neha Nupoor Yc: How do you even measure something like that? What is the approach?
[11/07/23, 10:56:33 AM] Mayank Gupta: Why should it make a difference if there is a single dev in India?
[11/07/23, 10:56:49 AM] ~ Kaushik Bokka: +1
[11/07/23, 11:09:49 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Time zone, culture and friction between rev-maxxing and cost-saving kicks in too soon. My (hypothetical) friend is less likely to get a US VISA/salary if the company has desi devs in team
[11/07/23, 11:10:09 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Mind you, this is for an engineering co-founder/leaders, not IC product engineers or similar
[11/07/23, 11:22:34 AM] Aditya Agrawal: Having a cofounder in US costs company 50-60k whereas having a developer costs 150-200k. Its easy as a founder to live in US and manage yourself at low cost but there is nearly 0% chance that you can hire anyone below 100k.
[11/07/23, 11:24:16 AM] Aditya Agrawal: A cofounder goes to any level to work on any Time zone, manage conflict and culture and works together on every step. Whereas otherwise most people look for what is best for themselves. and quit in tough times.
[11/07/23, 11:40:25 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Have been talking to a lot of friends from SF. I think I disagree now. For FAANG yes, but for early engineers or founders I think building for US market Is better but having engineers anywhere in the world is better.
[11/07/23, 11:42:41 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: "Finding" a cofounder is also different from "starting with someone". The latter is when ppl will compromise. Much harder to "find" people who will compromise.
[11/07/23, 11:42:44 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Yeah, it's better for the founder, not for the engineer 🤣
[11/07/23, 11:43:19 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: In US, even further since absolute need of money is different in orders.
[11/07/23, 11:43:44 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Also, its far uncommon to get 1% of a seed stage company in US than in India.
[11/07/23, 11:44:09 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Best arbitrage I feel is build for and raise in US, work from anywhere.
[11/07/23, 11:44:19 AM] Nirant Generative AI: And early engineers is a scam in India, zero trust — I've done that for 5 years of my career, and I'd rather jump from a bridge than do that again or send a friend down that path
[11/07/23, 11:44:36 AM] Pallav Nadhani: Elaborate more pls?
[11/07/23, 11:44:37 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Well, you joined a bad place :P
[11/07/23, 11:45:30 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Well, you joined exceptional places :P
[11/07/23, 11:45:32 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Recently heard early engineer stories from fk, zomato and likes of tier 1 Indian startups. They have done really well and the companies have backed them a lot better.
[11/07/23, 11:45:36 AM] Neha Nupoor Yc: Interested in knowing more
[11/07/23, 11:46:04 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: I didnt. I did join a bad place once too. You think no such scammy startups in SF?
[11/07/23, 11:46:17 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: They are more there.
[11/07/23, 11:46:28 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Capital availability increases scams not reduces.
[11/07/23, 11:46:55 AM] Pallav Nadhani: I think it’s more about the need “to show growth” (even if forcefully), to raise additional rounds.
[11/07/23, 11:47:07 AM] Nirant Generative AI: There are, but they pay more for the same scam. And rule of law still exists.
[11/07/23, 11:47:22 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Like at least the written word will have some value e.g. ESOP/shares
[11/07/23, 11:47:50 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: depends what we call value I think.
[11/07/23, 11:47:50 AM] Pallav Nadhani: Assuming most ESOPs aren’t underwater, already
[11/07/23, 11:48:10 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Are you saying US founders dont need to "show growth"?
[11/07/23, 11:48:35 AM] Pallav Nadhani: Everyone does. But the force fit is where it gets into muddled waters, either side of world
[11/07/23, 11:49:04 AM] ~ Kaushik Bokka: Sigh. I am so glad people are calling out the Dukaan founder for his tweet. 
I wish founders are more sensitive about layoffs and not use it as a hook for a feature lol. Inhumane.
[11/07/23, 11:49:24 AM] Nirant Generative AI: I've also not mentioned the learning curve, but why would I refer folks to founders in India unless I know the founder to be great. 
[11/07/23, 11:49:42 AM] Pallav Nadhani: Could be a well executed marketing bait too, which in case, then has done the job well #devilsAdvocate
[11/07/23, 11:49:45 AM] Shalabh Singh AI ASPIRO: Any relevant experiences you can share Nirant?
[11/07/23, 11:49:46 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Thats true for SF too no? Would you refer me to a stranger in US? 🥺
[11/07/23, 11:50:04 AM] Nirant Generative AI: That must've been intentional. Suumit ran digital marketing for housing and tinyowl for years, and they both used negative marketing to great effect.
[11/07/23, 11:50:21 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Go look at my Linkedin 🤣
[11/07/23, 11:50:36 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Hmm, I know more exceptional founders in SF than BLR if that makes it clearer
[11/07/23, 11:51:42 AM] ~ ashish: He could have definitively phrased it much better.
Came across as tone deaf - someone who cares more about features than employees
[11/07/23, 11:52:30 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Lololo no
[11/07/23, 11:52:55 AM] Nirant Generative AI: It was intentional and I'm sure it must've worked amazingly well.
[11/07/23, 11:53:09 AM] ~ Kaushik Bokka: Well. Still insensitive to the laid off employees :)
[11/07/23, 11:53:28 AM] Nirant Generative AI: I've deleted those tweets but I used that thought process of attractive negative attention to raise for the hackathon too. 
[11/07/23, 11:53:40 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: To be honest I doubt anyone really got laid off :P
[11/07/23, 11:53:44 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Well, ironically friends are trying to persuade me that it's okay to refer folks here
[11/07/23, 11:54:07 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Not because of AI anyone
[11/07/23, 11:54:18 AM] Nirant Generative AI: *anyway
[11/07/23, 11:55:09 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Prolly more because of market conditions and change in how much India2 is spending — which you can see from Amrutanjan, Relaxo sales and margins too. If people aren't buying balm (literal painkiller!) —  I doubt other categories are expanding fast. 
[11/07/23, 11:57:23 AM] Nishant SiteRecon AI: I think in US a lot many people are using Carta or other tools for ESOP management from very early on (since the inception of company). This provides some level of paperwork for the employees, and security 

In India, have seen em happening on Google Sheet and mail. That's fishy.

Same goes for notice period, it's prolly around a week for most companies in USA. For India, it stretches to 2 months, even more.
[11/07/23, 11:58:01 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: VCs enforce these things in India too. Non VC funded companies sure have a risk attached.
[11/07/23, 11:58:05 AM] Shalabh Singh AI ASPIRO: https://twitter.com/suumitshah/status/1678503672206983171?t=TPb2P4ylAdy1HW6lQ7vlbw&s=19

[11/07/23, 11:58:26 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Umm, people are buying this no? Unless something has changed recently
[11/07/23, 11:58:27 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Consumption hasn't reduced much
[11/07/23, 11:58:32 AM] ~ Pratiksha | Graphia.AI: I believe, a lot of these conversations are tangential to the theme of this group & can be done over DMs.
[11/07/23, 11:59:08 AM] ‪+1 (217) 904‑6011‬: I think most Indian founders don't realize the value of relationships before its too late. Early engineers should be the leaders of what they are doing, and not just executers. 

Also, for transparency, Angellist Growth Plan/Carta should be used from day 0.
[11/07/23, 12:03:47 PM] Nishant SiteRecon AI: Yup.

Maybe there is a selection bias on my side, but in US it is coming through the environment and in India it is being led through VCs, that's sad.

I think the Indian startup eco-system is less mature than bay area startups and that's the reason for this. There are less second-time founders around us, that's one reason.
[11/07/23, 12:04:07 PM] Aditya Agrawal: There are good and apples everywhere. We all have our learnings and experiences. I hired 2 folks very early on in their career . Trained them on leadership and gave enough time to fail and learn themes elves on technical skills. One of them has moved to a Director role in the startup, other is moving to US for higher education but continuing to work with us. First one is great long term value driver and other one is bit more risky but great value to the team. I think only thing I’m not ready to do is - to put tags and make conclusions.
[11/07/23, 12:05:09 PM] Bhavya e/acc: "bit more risky" - how?
[11/07/23, 12:05:31 PM] Aditya Agrawal: He might decide to join a US company in future and not work with us
[11/07/23, 12:06:16 PM] Aditya Agrawal: I would love my team to stick to the startup and I do the same for the longest time
[11/07/23, 12:10:22 PM] ‪+91 77990 81425‬: This is very loosely enforced if at all, even in vc funded startups. Have heard plenty of stories from early engineers where they got cheated on their esops/bonuses/perks, built complete products meanwhile and had to move because of not getting what they earned.
[11/07/23, 12:18:07 PM] Aditya Agrawal: Indian law is not very clear on ESOP and options which make it challenging for everyone in the ecosystem to act on it.
[11/07/23, 1:37:00 PM] Sumod Mohan Ai: Lack of experience probably. When you have too many people to please and you focus on wrong group at the wrong time. Many engineers and others now must be thinking "when us". Probably not the culture you want to create, esp if you are in deep shit.
[11/07/23, 3:28:06 PM] ~ Siddharth Bulia: Certainly not a story of everyone.
[11/07/23, 6:10:01 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: This is sad. I don’t think this is lindy.
[12/07/23, 10:42:13 AM] ~ Avikalp | Vibinex.com: I actually did. I've have both experiences. I left the bad place in 3 months of joining. And I stayed in the good place for 3.5 years, was rewarded well for it - and now that the company is also profitable (after my departure though), they called us back for a party to celebrate that our ESOPs will not go to zero value.
[12/07/23, 10:42:57 AM] ~ Avikalp | Vibinex.com: And now, in my own startup also, I have hired an early engineer. She is amazing - really takes ownership and sees her own success in the success of the company. And I plan to reward her handsomely as well.
[12/07/23, 10:44:22 AM] ~ Avikalp | Vibinex.com: I think it is just a matter of luck. All three cases involved strong references. Although, in both the good experiences, there is also a pre-existing social connection between the founders and the early employees.

[12/07/23, 5:48:40 PM] Nirant Generative AI: As long as we know that they're not GenAI companies 💖🫰
[12/07/23, 6:01:47 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Sorry, rebranding ourselves as

GenAI blockchain 3d printing metaverse company to make the world a better place 😤
[12/07/23, 6:06:15 PM] Kartik Springworks: Isn't portkey also infra? (btw we use Portkey at Albus and love it) 
IMO GenAI is one of three building GenAI(OpenAI, Cohere), using GenAI(Shopify, Intercom, Albus etc), tooling for GenAI(llama, langchain, portkey, inferless)
[12/07/23, 6:07:38 PM] Nirant Generative AI: Positioning aside, In my mind — Portkey is most def an ops play. Doesn't do hardware/server in any EC2/Lambda Labs way.
[12/07/23, 6:24:58 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Would love to hear what Portkey solves for you & will you pay for it
[12/07/23, 6:28:34 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Would you be able to elaborate what you mean in "ops" and a bit on what are the potential implications of the same?
[12/07/23, 6:28:58 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: This is a nice way of framing because of the audience base you sell to - model providers sell to everyone (business users, consumers, devs, data scientists), using Gen AI applications sell to knowledge workers & tooling vendors sell to devs, data scientists
[12/07/23, 6:29:06 PM] Nirant Generative AI: Yes, that'll be $500
[12/07/23, 6:30:10 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Credits le de ke khatam karte hain :)
[12/07/23, 6:35:42 PM] Kartik Springworks: Yes for paying.
1. Caching 
2. AB testing in prod  
3. Analytics 
4. Latency 
5. Raw logs
6. token consumption / $ 
I want more things like generating key per env per user - short lived keys, locked to domains, IPs and embeddable analytics to our users - basically everything that a datadog/aws/cloudwatch/IAM/mixpanel does
[12/07/23, 6:37:31 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: What other options did you explore?

If yes for paying, how would you prefer they priced it- seat based or usage?
[12/07/23, 6:38:40 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Interesting that you didn't include "model/product testing" here
[12/07/23, 6:38:43 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: $640 with GST
[12/07/23, 6:39:38 PM] Nirant Generative AI: Friends and Family discount for Pratyush @918763968157 sir
[12/07/23, 6:39:48 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Feels like the classic MLOps unbundling of the stack problem. But observability always finds its users & buyers

Deployment & inferencing not so much
[12/07/23, 6:40:10 PM] Nirant Generative AI: Nailed it
[12/07/23, 6:40:13 PM] Kartik Springworks: 1. promptlayer, humanloop, promptbase
2. usage I think
3. model makes sense in the future but at this point - I want to blindly go for GPT4
[12/07/23, 6:41:20 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Can go on multiple tangents w/ MLOps stack piece by the way - some we've discussed 1:1 multiple times too :) 

But very briefly, ML is different from LLM from a deployment perspective - and this "changes" a lot of things
[12/07/23, 6:41:33 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Buyers, workflows, workloads, use-cases, adoptions, budgets, GTM, etc etc
[12/07/23, 6:46:42 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Agreed 👍🏻

On observability: incumbents like W&B, Arize, Fiddler etc are too powerful for any new startup to gain significant market share.
[12/07/23, 6:49:17 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Must be exactly what people said to DataDog when they went up against AppD & DT :) 

IMHO, all depends on the workload - 

1/ How different is it?

2/ Are the stakeholders different?

3/ How big is it?
[12/07/23, 6:50:47 PM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: Don't tell me there's no cash at all. Together we stand, divided we fall

[15/07/23, 3:39:14 PM] Aditya Agrawal: @919910270434 welcome to the group. Can you please introduce yourself to the group.
[15/07/23, 9:23:03 PM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Let’s add diwank here? Awesome to see his idea.  I remember chatting with him for feedback in early days when I was figuring out on Dashtoon.
[16/07/23, 9:18:34 AM] Amir Youdazzl AI: Great to see introductions to innovations happening around the world 👍

I think it will help the community in general if we have a separate group for promotions, semi/un-moderated, and people join it from their own side

Or we do ~self~ proxy promotions, though i fail to see why that's ok and direct one is not
[16/07/23, 9:21:32 AM] ~ Prashant Singh: Sure. I am a noob when it comes to Generative AI and LLM stuff . I started and sold an AI company (Shifu) sometime back . Was heading product at Paytm for a while and now working with JAR - A fintecj firm in Bangalroe

[16/07/23, 10:21:22 AM] Aditya Agrawal: @919611930033 Mods had a separate discussion about this. As we have seen that folks in our community are responsible from their own side and are not spammy/promotional . It is good to be flexible/fluid. But if there is a pattern then we should fix it.

[17/07/23, 7:12:34 AM] Ojasvi Yadav Dukaan: He seems to be almost of the opinion that the lesser money you raise, the lesser weight you'll carry over your shoulders 

Being lightweight will then allow a lean team to either quickly make money or quickly pivot
[17/07/23, 7:14:08 AM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: Truth
[17/07/23, 7:14:35 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: And good for the industry, too. Shouldn’t/can’t keep repeating ZIRP playbook angin and again.
[17/07/23, 7:47:33 AM] Nitin Mahajan 88 Vc: 💯
[17/07/23, 7:51:22 AM] Rahul Bhatnagar Ai: @917737887058 , similar to our discussion. He's right about indies optimizing for quick iterations + fast GTMs w/ PLG. Like https://www.chatbase.co/
[17/07/23, 7:53:36 AM] Rahul Bhatnagar Ai: At the other extreme, there are quiet enterprises asking for onprem fine tuned models for RAG / Codegen etc. But haven't seen those sales cycles play out so hard to measure that enterprise-y demand.
[17/07/23, 7:54:49 AM] Kartik Springworks: Companies like Moveworks, Glean, Leena, Yellow do make tens of millions if not millions so there's traction in GenAI in companies
[17/07/23, 7:55:52 AM] Neha Nupoor Yc: Is glean a genai company? They were search providers iirc
[17/07/23, 7:56:05 AM] Neha Nupoor Yc: They recently added chat support.

[17/07/23, 7:56:35 AM] Kartik Springworks: Yes I think they use GenAI now
[17/07/23, 7:56:46 AM] Rahul Bhatnagar Ai: Yeah, it's easier for companies who already have distribution to add genAI to upsell / open up newer experiences.
[17/07/23, 7:56:55 AM] Neha Nupoor Yc: Their core was search on internal data

That said.. Yes imaginative ideas in application layer are still too many to just dismiss
[17/07/23, 8:10:17 AM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: Few thoughts / comments:

1. Another category which won are AI influencers, Threadbois, etc
2. While big company is doing something they didn't usually do (preferring build over buy), is this equally true for enterprise tech over enterprise non tech?
[17/07/23, 8:22:23 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: Speaks focus is well positioned, it's not a language learning platform. It is for improving fluency in English so that any immigrant(s) gains fluency so that they are able to navigate the language barrier, otherwise which is very difficult
[17/07/23, 8:23:41 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: And that's the dependency I was talking about :)

[19/07/23, 3:03:52 PM] ‪+1 (425) 941‑4613‬: Thx for sharing. I like this one:

Feedback is the breakfast of champions:  Once a year we had my co-founder, Dharmesh Shah, do a 360 review for me that was like pure gold.  His method is highly replicable.  He basically gave an NPS survey to about 25 folks up and down the org asking two questions:  (a) “Your likelihood to recommend Brian as the CEO of HubSpot" & (b) “Why?”  He took the answers to those questions and put together a 20 page document for me.  He found the themes in the feedback (people wrote novellas) and grouped them together with example quotes to back up the theme.  For example, “Brian is good at setting and selling the vision for HubSpot” would be the theme and then he’d pick out 6 or 7 direct quotes that backed this up.  …Now, not all the themes were positive like that one.  The first 10 pages were my “feature” themes and the back 10 pages were my “bug” themes.  I was convinced I was the world’s best CEO after page 10 and the world’s worst CEO after page 20!  I shared the feedback with the company and board in a document that was my own “performance plan.”  

@919953076613 we should do this.

[21/07/23, 3:42:32 PM] Shashank Kapadia: Uma, I’d be happy to assist. While synthetic data is one of the ways, I am assuming/suggest looking into alternative approach to improve if you happen to have even a small dataset that’s reliable. Generating synthetic data comes with many considerations. Nonetheless, I have had experience generating it for search and recommendations product, and would be happy to share my experience.

[23/07/23, 10:45:17 AM] Rahul Bhatnagar Ai: Yeah. Yasser and his product chatbase.co is one of the best examples I can find about how to execute and iterate while blocking out the ‘no moat’ / ‘defensibility’ noise. He hit over 1M$+ in 3 months.

Amazing PLG + low touch onboarding. I use his example repeatedly when folks mention the pushback from investors on these points.
[23/07/23, 10:51:13 AM] ‪+91 95913 74691‬: He did have first mover advantage and caught the hype cycle. But I don't know if they can be a venture business unless they change focus
[23/07/23, 10:57:35 AM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: It’s a great business and we need more of these (audionotes, vidyo.ai being examples from India). You don’t need venture funding when you can achieve this kind of success without it
[23/07/23, 10:57:37 AM] Rahul Bhatnagar Ai: There were a bunch of people doing it. Mostly folks stopped at the GenAI part. Mostly by creating Streamlit notebooks and Colab demos. 

He really polished the product out. And the onboarding with give your website url -> get an iframe to include on your website in a couple of minutes.

I think he mentioned that he isn’t looking to raise a VC round. Trying to get to 5M$ ARR as an indie dev + small team.
[23/07/23, 11:00:48 AM] ‪+91 95913 74691‬: Yeah, SiteGPT did the same.
[23/07/23, 11:00:59 AM] Rahul Bhatnagar Ai: Will check them out. The indie devs have an advantage here. With very quick time to market + rapid experimentation.
[23/07/23, 11:01:52 AM] ‪+91 95913 74691‬: but it was undoubtedly because of the hype. If you build something like that today you won't be able to get that growth which is what I'm saying. Indie devs do not get that kind of growth.
[23/07/23, 11:03:36 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Or you can go for a specific domain with kb curation service in b2b instead of generic talk to data tool.
[23/07/23, 11:04:12 AM] Rahul Bhatnagar Ai: I think it more about launching the product at the right cycle than building a chatbase right now. And increasing your shots at finding the hype cycle by launching products quickly.
[23/07/23, 11:08:00 AM] Rahul Bhatnagar Ai: Yeah. This is the famous SaaS debate - high touchpoint with longer sales cycles + high revenue/user vs low touch self serve products that are basically like consumer products.
[23/07/23, 11:09:23 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Do we have any consumer startup making profits since start of the ZIRP cycle without burning VC money? ‎<This message was edited>
[23/07/23, 11:11:16 AM] Rahul Bhatnagar Ai: Haha yeah. Bad choice of words. I meant products that don’t need sales teams etc. but rely on PLG (similiar to consumer products.)
[23/07/23, 11:11:39 AM] ~ Siddharth Bulia: Nykaa?
[23/07/23, 11:12:56 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: They are not a tech company
[23/07/23, 11:13:13 AM] Aditya Agrawal: We burnt our hands doing sales/enterprise last couple of months and now starting PLG approach
[23/07/23, 11:15:43 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: IMO AI consumer or product led growth is a very long game and due to reproducibility and novelty, consumers are going to keep trying new things. No loyalty.
[23/07/23, 11:17:39 AM] ~ Prashant Singh: can you expand upon this ? your observation is global or India specific
[23/07/23, 11:19:44 AM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: Probably bcz consumer attention is finite. Loyalty is hard to build.
[23/07/23, 11:20:36 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Indian consumer is more stingy, so they will go for cheaper and freer option first. But Indian consumer is not worried about privacy and other things. Global, is opposite so consumer adaption will be through incumbent trust.
[23/07/23, 11:22:02 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: So for good product, only option can be acquisition game
[23/07/23, 11:22:31 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Again, this is my “opinion”
[23/07/23, 11:22:58 AM] ~ Chinmay Shah: IDP would put restrictions on companies using consumer data. but the worry would only be personal data, should be good otherwise.
[23/07/23, 11:24:34 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: IDP is for big corps. We don’t have  workforce or competency in government to enforce at startup level ‎<This message was edited>
[23/07/23, 11:33:23 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: At least IMO the New 'new moat'  in consumer products will be the extent of personalization. So companies building there should and must also focus on understanding personalization typically killing it at models like the Hooked model by nir eyal. 

Convenience drives dependency and dependency is powerful enough to have a paid user base.
[23/07/23, 11:35:37 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Yeah, heard Nat Frieman saying the same thing in one of the meetup. ‘AI gf’ is no-no topic for many incumbent, and that consumer domain is widely open to capture. ‎<This message was edited>
[23/07/23, 11:39:07 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: Inflection AI is a classic example of creating moat  In the Foundation model space + consumer use cases. Have a look at the extent at which pi is personalized it is just insanely better than bard and others even than c.ai which apparently I thought can be a good consumer product but they have been lagging there as well.
[23/07/23, 11:40:20 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Pi is bad though. The hype died in a week. Not good for consumer product. Character.ai is probably a better example.
[23/07/23, 11:41:10 AM] Mayank Gupta: Interesting that you both have the exact opposite take on Inflection vs C.ai!
[23/07/23, 11:42:22 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: That’s healthy actually. We have runway to calibrate opinions.
[23/07/23, 11:42:51 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: @918072173935 check out buzz that Hermes model is creating.
[23/07/23, 11:42:57 AM] Mayank Gupta: Totally agree. Love it and waiting to hear more. Agree with the base premise so very interested!
[23/07/23, 11:43:36 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: I don't think so, their moat is going to clear when they start building use cases on top of just the Pi chatbot. 

We are seeing just the bot right now but I've been playing around with it a lot. They've built it as a multi modal , it's also able to do things like give me a good analysis on how I'm singing and where I missed the note, tempo, pitch and all
[23/07/23, 11:44:02 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: Thanks! I'll check it out :)
[23/07/23, 11:44:06 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Hermes, I see that as a good start in personalized AI companion running locally, away from data privacy and less RLHF corp crap ‎<This message was edited>
[23/07/23, 11:45:11 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: If I want a companion to whom I talk about everything, I want local and away from large corps data minefield. The reason we don’t like or talk to Alexa much.
[23/07/23, 11:46:01 AM] ~ Prashant Singh: why you like Character .ai . i tried it. it get basic things wrong
[23/07/23, 11:47:09 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: Spotify
[23/07/23, 11:47:20 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: Again personalization
[23/07/23, 11:47:22 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: I don’t like it either. I was talking about how people may like personalized content. Ultimate personalized companion, in my opinion should be in my premise, who may even store my ssn and bank account to book an appointment.

[23/07/23, 11:49:52 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Personalized use cases that will be product that real people will use are not talking to Mark, but someone booking my appointment, and have personal information. Something that has own persona.
[23/07/23, 11:50:28 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Talking to zuck and Elon are gimmicks. Not a real use case.
[23/07/23, 11:55:28 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: I guess we are talking a lot further in future, so I’ll stop my chain of thoughts.
[23/07/23, 11:59:49 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: +1
 toys , nothing constructive I feel.
[23/07/23, 12:00:37 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Having names that you can count by fingers after billions of dollars of investment is not a good look though. Most of the consumer one that got acquired, took down incumbent with them. ‎<This message was edited>
[23/07/23, 12:01:05 PM] Mayank Gupta: My small thought here is that the other capability which will come in here is Planning / Coordination. So that along with Personalisation will be the true differentiator
[23/07/23, 12:02:06 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Completely agree. My personalization definition has more to do with planning then having a soft spoken bot.
[23/07/23, 12:02:51 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Someone I can feel safe to share my ssn and Adhar.
[23/07/23, 12:04:01 PM] Mayank Gupta: Yeah. I separate it into Decision Making and Execution. Decision making is the personalisation part (along with expandable memory - for eg that coupon that's about to expire too) and the latter is the Planning Coordination part ‎<This message was edited>
[23/07/23, 12:04:28 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Plan and book the whole trip to Iceland, give me a packing list and brief me about the itinerary on flight.
[23/07/23, 12:07:43 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: That’s why smart folks at OpenAI came up with plugins. They are eating next abstraction layers lunch money, before founders realize.
[23/07/23, 12:08:38 PM] Mayank Gupta: Though I personally think we've miles to go before the right UX emerges!
[23/07/23, 12:09:27 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: But not everyone will like OpenAI, but OpenAI is successfully Abel to convince these companies to have plugin.json file on their website. Now, that other should be able exploit too. 😜 ‎<This message was edited>
[23/07/23, 12:11:17 PM] Mayank Gupta: This is the other part I think is critical which was getting discussed sometime back. I believe in an open communication layer - more natural language I/O akin to the Internet. If you support it as an app / plugin, you can allow any Personal AI to make use of it
[23/07/23, 12:11:51 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: If ChatGPT can query Expedia, Hermes at my home should be Abel to do it, too. (Of course in future)
[23/07/23, 12:17:00 PM] ‪+91 96115 80491‬: Was taking to a friend at a major unicorn and realised a major GTM blocker that some saas startups might be facing :

So this friends team wanted to integrate an off the shelf chat microsaas for their customer support. They proposed it to tech, the product manager and engg lead rejected it saying “we should build it ourselves in 2 months”. His conclusion: same PM and Engg manager did not have bandwidth for many other asks - but  a genAI led solution will set them up for promotion, and they would rather do that than buy something that solves the problem today!

[24/07/23, 12:08:29 AM] ‪+91 88980 20185‬: No. Just no. If that's a startup selling 1000s of SKUs they will get into the world of vectorDBs and then it will be a longgg grind. Cosine similarity is nobodies frnd. It will take way longer than 2 months to be something customers will pay for. Not to forget infosec and compliance. Wait till it suggests the competitor as sota. These things take longer than 2 months to be custom and accurate
[24/07/23, 12:14:48 AM] ‪+91 96321 47475‬: IMHO those are really short term. 
Once the team gets promos and nobody really cares about maintaining the project, they will migrate to the market leading SaaS tool.

[29/07/23, 7:59:22 PM] Manish Rastogi Twing: Hello everyone. 
My name is Manish. I am the founder of Twing(trytwing.com)

Me along with my cofounder have recently started the company after facing a problem that probably has affected almost all of us. Being productive, being able to focus on your actual work. 

We are building a product to tackle distractions, context switches and notification overload in the workplace and help people be their most productive self by cutting down on "work about work"

I am happy to talk more about this if anyone is interested. 
We believe that our products can help the most for people who have to coordinate with a lot of people or manage multiple things (yes, founders are a big part of it)

Please feel free to contact me if you would like to test out our MVP.

You can connect with me on LinkedIn(https://www.linkedin.com/in/manish--rastogi) or just drop me a message and I would be very glad to talk to you or help you in any way I can.
[29/07/23, 8:00:58 PM] Divya Tak Ai: How are you guys using gen ai in this?
[29/07/23, 8:01:00 PM] Divya Tak Ai: This sounds quite cool
[29/07/23, 8:03:54 PM] Manish Rastogi Twing: Currently we are using gen ai to minimize the amount of information that comes to us on a daily basis. The idea is to contextualize the information and try to extract the most relevant parts as well as insights for you.  The value we want to provide is in how we use ai to actually make your life easier without a necessary input from you. The product should not add any cognitive load to you but still help you work better by pushing right things to you at the right time. A sort of a right hand man who you don't have to instruct or teach how to do things.
[29/07/23, 8:04:12 PM] Manish Rastogi Twing: Thank you. Appreciate it.

[31/07/23, 5:38:19 PM] Brij Singh Rebright Partners: I’m thinking of productising this as part our new platform for India - US corridor. 

Bring Finance, Legal, Accounting, Compliance management under one umbrella product with a network of curated Service providers part for specific use cases as needed.
[31/07/23, 5:44:52 PM] Nirant Generative AI: Sir where do we sign up? Who do we call?
[31/07/23, 5:52:45 PM] Brij Singh Rebright Partners: Done. @917737799743  is building it, Alpha is out by end of Aug. 

We will have Auto AI Agents that can be “configured” to manage various “Project” use cases.  They will orchestrate the interactions, so analysis and make recommendations on Actions to be taken. 

We have a US attorney as part of the founding team to standardise all your sales, commercial and other contractual matters.  

We are bringing on CFO both in India and US who will advise on issues like Revenue Recognition, billing & collections, audits and reconciliation.   

Idea being that AI Agents will handle all the mundane regular work and kick up to the Mixture of Experts (both internal and external) to advise on complicated matters as part of the same Productised offerings, Prof and Enterprise plans.
[31/07/23, 5:55:04 PM] Brij Singh Rebright Partners: If this is interest, please write to me on brij@snowmountain.ai and I will add you to the waitlist.  

Alpha access to those who describe their issues in detail in the email and are willing to come on board as design partners.
[31/07/23, 5:56:55 PM] Nirant Generative AI: Is there a version without agents or AI, I'll sign up for that
[31/07/23, 6:01:14 PM] Brij Singh Rebright Partners: Just think of it as Dashboard UX, with prof services backed.  Forget about the AI and agent mumbo jumbo.  

Thought this was a AI group, my bad
[31/07/23, 6:04:19 PM] ‪+91 77377 99743‬: Curious, What are the actual concerns you have?

Our plan is to use AI agents for: 

- document processing (so that you don't have to fill forms when you have already uploaded docs) 
- and task-tracking (so that all service providers don't have to be onboarded to a new tool and workflow)
[31/07/23, 6:47:38 PM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: A firm which can take care of India plus US startups and where CAs are process driven and do not use compliance speak is bigger moat than most genAI startups.

*Accel Atoms 3.0 with AI Cohort is here*

I'm thrilled to announce that applications for our AI cohort are now open. We back startups where AI is an integral part of the product as well as those with emerging ideas irrespective of an MVP. Accel Atoms will invest upto $500K. 

If you’re building in AI at: https://bit.ly/3YdBVsn
[01/08/23, 10:08:41 AM] Nirant Generative AI: How many DGX 100 can we buy in $500K @917407651462 on today's rates?
[01/08/23, 10:15:23 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: 2 & keep the remaining for your electricity bill
[01/08/23, 10:16:05 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Okay, how many can we rent for a year? About 7-10?
[01/08/23, 10:16:15 AM] Nirant Generative AI: The 40G one ofc
[01/08/23, 10:17:12 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: With the new funding from Nvidia you could totally strike a great deal with Lamda Labs or CoreWeave. Nvidia cloud is also doubling down as an alternative to public clouds
[01/08/23, 10:17:25 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: 10 easy!
[01/08/23, 10:21:58 AM] Dev Aggarwal AI: About 40 in gcp spot instances
[01/08/23, 10:22:42 AM] Dev Aggarwal AI: 80 probably if you talk to them cause at half a mil they’ll give you bulk discount
[01/08/23, 10:23:08 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Discounts are for recurring usage.
[01/08/23, 10:23:50 AM] Dev Aggarwal AI: They told me if I give them a ramp plan for like 200k they’ll give me upto 50% discount
[01/08/23, 10:24:04 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Yea coz they are assuming you’ll continue.
[01/08/23, 10:24:20 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Coz once you ramp up, likely case you can’t disappear.
[01/08/23, 10:24:36 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: @917737887058 on the other hand is thinking differently here iiuc
[01/08/23, 10:24:59 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Stop spilling my plans like this Soumyadeep
[01/08/23, 10:25:36 AM] Kishore (Workbrow) Ai: In how many years?
[01/08/23, 10:25:44 AM] Dev Aggarwal AI: 1
[01/08/23, 10:25:58 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Also personal opinion around clouds is that mental overhead of running opex often hampers experiments.
[01/08/23, 10:26:33 AM] Nirant Generative AI: That is why I asked if I can buy first
[01/08/23, 10:27:13 AM] Nirant Generative AI: (Puts on my buzzfeed hat) Investors wouldn't encourage cloud so strongly if they knew this one trick!
[01/08/23, 10:27:38 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: But recently learnt having compute isn’t enough, storage on capex is needed too. 
And also, bandwidth 😂
[01/08/23, 10:28:00 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: So soon you’ll be managing a mini cloud
[01/08/23, 10:28:46 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Hahaha I think it’s not that trivial a trick
[01/08/23, 10:28:57 AM] Nirant Generative AI: I love how you call a $200K cloud "mini"
[01/08/23, 10:29:26 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Micro is Moro accurate I think
[01/08/23, 10:29:31 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: *more
[01/08/23, 10:29:34 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: True only for scale. Zoox went from AWS to having their own cluster of 1500 GPUs & a team to maintain it to back to AWS. For smaller workloads, setting up your own cluster is the best idea
[01/08/23, 10:30:08 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: I’ll argue zoox couldn’t hire well 😋
[01/08/23, 10:30:33 AM] Soumyadeep Mukherjee Dashtoons: Also it depends a lot on just pure conviction of the person incharge
[01/08/23, 10:31:11 AM] Nirant Generative AI: Does someone know engineers and folks at Zoox? Maybe a great cloud/infra case for GPUs in particular? 

Would love to have them here

[01/08/23, 10:35:05 AM] Aditya Agrawal: Please send
[01/08/23, 10:35:33 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Have a dropped him a message, will message you once he confirms
[01/08/23, 10:35:37 AM] Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni: Maybe they are training critical models in house and other models on AWS? IMO, the moment the model becomes big enough that you need to do tensor parallel and pipeline parallel methods, you will need to hire more people who understand it better. These are not so intuitive but NVDIA has tried to make it as easy as possible on cuda but still it needs some handholding. Which is why they charge the additional $100k in support when they price a DGX-H100(SXM)
[01/08/23, 10:36:55 AM] Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni: Cluster management for in house cluster is not that trivial. Even in the Bloomberg GPT paper and the earlier GPT papers, they talk about how many times they had to restart training due to HW downtimes etc
[01/08/23, 10:37:30 AM] Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni: That said every org does make a choice between doing this in house vs paying that extra money to any CSP
[01/08/23, 10:37:35 AM] Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni: It’s a trade off
[01/08/23, 10:38:18 AM] Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni: Not sure if this has been shared here: https://gpus.llm-utils.org/nvidia-h100-gpus-supply-and-demand/ - This is an interesting article
[01/08/23, 10:38:30 AM] Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni: Insightful I would say

[07/08/23, 2:38:36 PM] ~ Rajiv Poddar: No, I meant developer API access. They have a rate limits on the API. You have to apply for production API key to get it removed.
[07/08/23, 2:42:16 PM] ~ Chinmay Shah: you have to request dec access on their website
[07/08/23, 2:42:18 PM] ‪+91 87870 63672‬: As I see it on their website, they are accepting applications for access, not giving it just by login
[07/08/23, 2:43:20 PM] ~ Chinmay Shah: this is for developer access. Once you are ready for production access, we have to apply for access. that entails answering some trust and safety answers.

For the same, we are looking forward to developing a "Midjourney for Experiences" builder inside our product which can help product teams  build and customize these experiences for relevant cohorts of users within seconds. 

Glad to be connected. Feel free to reach out to me here on WhatsApp or at twitter.com/mesnhl

Your assumption of via I for video doesn't cover the whole temporal aspect of things which is quite quintessential in classification.

‎[10/08/23, 6:11:24 PM] Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai: ‎image omitted
[10/08/23, 7:53:46 PM] ~ Utkarsh Saxena: Feel you man. This shortlisted thing is such a vague message 😅 don't know what to make of it. So I just asked for feedback
[11/08/23, 9:14:41 AM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: Here're few India based GenAI accelerator programs I know of:

1. Accel atoms - https://atoms.accel.com/ai. Seems super select (upto 5 startups, 500k$)
2. ML elevate by Accel & AWS - https://www.mlelevate.com/ (unsure about funds)
3. By NASSCOM - https://form.jotform.com/231832538144455  (unsure about funds)
4. Upekkha - SaaS accelerator but has a huge % of AI startups. 100k (disclosure: we were a part).
[11/08/23, 9:19:26 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Any one know if AI grant has any cap on safe notes?
[11/08/23, 9:26:49 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: The reason I’m asking, the Atoms looks like a much better deal
[11/08/23, 9:27:28 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Here's a better deal than Atoms
https://www.hf0.com/
[11/08/23, 9:28:00 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: The challenge with Indian VCs is deal flow is too high, capital is too low
[11/08/23, 9:28:24 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Founders need to look outside for capital
[11/08/23, 9:29:23 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Man, I have a little reservations about some of these cultiest looking things in SF. Most of the time it is insiders who gets in, just like YC.
[11/08/23, 9:29:44 AM] ~ Chinmay Shah: Did you get any reply? Even we got the same message
[11/08/23, 9:30:04 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Same everywhere bro, especially in India. It's all a circle jerk

But no harm trying. You never know eh?
[11/08/23, 9:34:06 AM] ‪+91 87706 15900‬: what do you mean by insiders who get in? like friends of ycom staff?
[11/08/23, 9:35:06 AM] Aditya Agrawal: Who all beleive in building a bootstrapped company till PMF and raise only for growth?
[11/08/23, 9:35:40 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Some of it is elitism, like the usual Stanford/Berkeley badge

Then it's usually referrals from previous YC founders 

But you start seeing a pattern when you meet fellow founders
[11/08/23, 9:39:08 AM] ~ Kaushik Bokka: yeah, have a friend who is ex google started building a prompts library in June and got into the recent batch of YC
[11/08/23, 9:40:41 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: I know at least three YC backed startups that are just libraries I wrote for my applications in Feb/March.
[11/08/23, 9:41:18 AM] Aditya Agrawal: The sad part is the world starts beleiving in you when you are a YC startup..
[11/08/23, 9:41:31 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: 🙏🙏🙏
[11/08/23, 9:42:02 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Sir, 

I would love to help you. Connecting in DM
[11/08/23, 9:42:03 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: That maybe used to be the case, does it still happen?
[11/08/23, 9:43:05 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: One thing YC does well is that people start using your products & give you feedback

But every major YC success story has had a very different story of how they got into the same: Stripe, Airbnb, Instacart, Coinbase were all non-typical applications from what I know
[11/08/23, 9:43:33 AM] Aditya Agrawal: I get 3 inbound reach outs every week because our name is similar to a YC backed startup.  and they want to be associated with that.
[11/08/23, 9:43:50 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Good idea and thought for sure - not all products can be built out this way though

Some products require high upfront R&D investments - how does one solve for that?
[11/08/23, 9:45:02 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Don’t get me wrong, YC is great and they have build the valley indirectly. It’s like a huge invite only club where your dog food is get eaten by the club to get you the initial boost in revenue and clout. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/08/23, 9:45:20 AM] Aditya Agrawal: True, Moonshot products need R&D investment. but do we have enough backers and builder in that space?
[11/08/23, 9:46:26 AM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: Btw what's some good YC equivalent in India? I think FC is great with good enough portco size. Even better than the original standard YC deal
[11/08/23, 9:46:35 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Let’s say if we expand this AI community that Nirant has started into 5k founders, boost each other, we can also get some lift off.
[11/08/23, 9:46:45 AM] ~ Shubham: ‎~ Shubham joined using this group's invite link
[11/08/23, 9:47:20 AM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: In some way we are already doing. But there is definitely depth here. For founders, by the founders.
[11/08/23, 9:48:49 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: @917880067859 we got to build the map of the companies in these groups. Start eating each others dog food.
[11/08/23, 9:49:35 AM] Aditya Agrawal: Yeah I think we need some volunteers from the group or hire a person to get some of these projects get kicked off..
[11/08/23, 9:50:12 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Sir, quite a few things here - 

1/ YC has all cloud native startups where the founders have similar backgrounds. Using their dog food helps when you get that level of feedback especially when you're a pre-PMF company

2/ That worked well in the ZIRP era - unsure how that plays out in this era where people aren't buying as much software as they used to

3/ It's no longer an invite only club - not every company benefits being a part of YC. As I said, some of the best success stories were not common/typical applications
[11/08/23, 9:50:24 AM] Aditya Agrawal: I have been reached out by folks for sponsorship, we should have a discussion on how we want to take things forward,..
[11/08/23, 9:51:13 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: From where I stand, I think so - enough appetite to build & fund moonshots

Success will take some time but we do have the ambitions - we (as an ecosystem) have funded a tonne of deeptech over the past 2-3 years, Gen AI or not
[11/08/23, 9:52:08 AM] Aditya Agrawal: @19377081307 : copy
[11/08/23, 9:55:58 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: You’re right. A lot of ZIRP companies. And even though best stories are not typical applications, there selection process still influenced by the references.
[11/08/23, 9:56:03 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: If this AI boom were at a bull run, funding spring we would have seen 100s of funding in AI in India by now. 

Currently 90% on the unit economics side 10% on innovation AI is purely at the innovation stage, unit economics will drastically change in 18 months.
[11/08/23, 9:56:08 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: This is something I have been debating a lot w/ a lot of people for a long time. Sharing some pointers - 

1/ Dogfooding can only get you so far - the best companies will have to have a strong, defensible PMF. That unfortunately cannot be replicated very easily everywhere 

2/ There is a difference in $xM in revenue and $xM in PMF revenue - revenue milestones alone might not be enough for next fundraising rounds for startups

3/ The way you define ROI is different as per geographies - for instance, if you're selling to developers, 2 hours of productivity gains for a dev in India ≠ what one would get for the same gains for a US-based dev. This impacts pricing, business models and a lot of downstream things. And I am not at all saying one is any better than the other
[11/08/23, 9:57:43 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Happy to share more learnings w/ the broader group if that'd be helpful - I spend 95% of my time w/ infrastructure startups anyways, at the earliest stages

Have seen quite a lot of battle scars
[11/08/23, 9:57:45 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: Vice versa in the US, sure unit economics has a role but only for AI US is again many years ahead. Not talking about funding that boosts valuation that's for sure their, but US usquick at fundig innovation
[11/08/23, 9:58:32 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: I'll love to elaborate a little bit on that if folks would find it relevant
[11/08/23, 9:59:07 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: A blog post has been in the draft mode for quite some time 😅
[11/08/23, 10:00:32 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: ‎Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai reset this group's invite link
[11/08/23, 10:00:27 AM] Aditya Agrawal: We should do a zoom call for that.. So we can also ask our dumb questions ..
[11/08/23, 10:01:28 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: 1/ we don’t dog food here, combining forces we will not even have valuable feedback. Let’s give them some traction.

3/ isn’t that an advantage if something being built in India as AI applications mostly not geographically limited.
[11/08/23, 10:02:04 AM] Aditya Agrawal: Yar Pratik people here are scared to share notes and learning so many times..
[11/08/23, 10:02:12 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: No question is dumb 🙏🏻

I think one thing we need to do better as an ecosystem is encourage more of these tough/uncomfortable conversations and discussions w/o any judgements
[11/08/23, 10:03:00 AM] Aditya Agrawal: I learnt talking to Nirant.. that 90%  questions I ask I have to tell.. Please ignore if its a dumb question.. ‎<This message was edited>
[11/08/23, 10:03:01 AM] Aditya Agrawal: :D
[11/08/23, 10:03:19 AM] Aditya Agrawal: 😃😃
[11/08/23, 10:03:34 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: 1/ Not sure if I got what you're saying here sir - could you please elaborate? 

My point is a little counter intuitive but helps in the longer run - some traction might not be enough for most companies, especially if you're going after a new disruptive/innovative category (as founders like to call it)
[11/08/23, 10:03:40 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: I would love to hear @918763968157 if he wants to setup a call. Learning is something you can’t stop working on
[11/08/23, 10:03:56 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Kar do yaar ek chai pe charcha
[11/08/23, 10:04:17 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Happy to do an open Zoom 🙏🏻
[11/08/23, 10:04:25 AM] Aditya Agrawal: What time?
[11/08/23, 10:04:29 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: @918763968157 do it
[11/08/23, 10:05:29 AM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: If anyone wants to do ‘chai pe charcha’ in person - you can use our office. It can accommodate 20-25 people at once
[11/08/23, 10:05:51 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: In temporal reality of truth, everything will be dumb tomorrow, so I don’t care asking anything.
[11/08/23, 10:05:51 AM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: Sorry @19377081307 for suggesting in person🤪
[11/08/23, 10:05:58 AM] Aditya Agrawal: Zoom karte.. we will save time traveling and more time discussing.
[11/08/23, 10:06:09 AM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: Yes. It's not about dogfooding. It's about using India cost advantage to build 10x and see what sticks.

I think it's not yet possible to project what will work in genAI and hence build and see what sticks is the only viable approach and should be celebrated.
[11/08/23, 10:06:25 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: 3/ Again, didn't get your question sir 

Let's do this estimate - co-pilot is $100/dev/year. It saves devs x hours and that accounts to $y in savings and hence, Github can command $10/month/dev which is usually a 10-15% of the value someone delivers 

Let's do the same math for a Co-Pilot like product in India - how will that work out?

x dev hours would most likely be $<<y in savings - please correct me if I am wrong here
[11/08/23, 10:06:37 AM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: Sunday suitable time?
[11/08/23, 10:06:37 AM] Aditya Agrawal: @919952465050 just coz you have a cool office in Indira nagar.. 😃😃
[11/08/23, 10:07:11 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: @918763968157 you can setup a call now
[11/08/23, 10:07:30 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Flexing, I see 😂

[11/08/23, 10:08:26 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: GenAI any new tech atleast for 18 months will never attract funding coz of product. It moves so fast that people who have appetite to fail fast and convince VCs to trust that appetite will only get funds.
[11/08/23, 10:08:36 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Oh wow, are we doing right now, now?

I am sure such an initiative will bring amazing results. If I can help out in any way I can. I can get some of my peers to act as sounding boards for such a good initiative.
[11/08/23, 10:10:03 AM] Aditya Agrawal: Yea we are on call
[11/08/23, 10:13:11 AM] ~ Utkarsh Saxena: Nope
[11/08/23, 10:41:59 AM] ‪+91 99458 85649‬: Very interesting conversation. I have met a few folks from this group in person and one thing I have noticed is the tech-first thinking instead of problem-first. We have a new tech in hand, what do I build to monetize it. Having built more a dozen products in my lifetime, i can say going problem first, then building a business model around it and figuring out what tech or non-tech stuff needs to come into play has always worked. Happy to get on 1:1 conversations if anybody wants to have a sounding board for their ideas.

Disclaimer: i am also working on some problem spaces.

[11/08/23, 1:56:16 PM] ~ Rajiv Poddar: Folks, I just came back from SFO last month. I would recommend everyone in GenAI to pay a visit. There's amazing activity there, about 3 to 4 good events per week. The discussions are completely different there. It's just build build build. Everybody is racing right now. It's the place to be if you're in GenAI.

[11/08/23, 2:17:34 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Looks like no Twitter influencer from Bangalore wants to maintain list like the one from Bay Area, get some clout and start an AI India Newsletter in coming months.
[11/08/23, 2:19:20 PM] Aditya Agrawal: lol

[11/08/23, 2:23:58 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: You can make it pan India. Ai newsletter space for India is wide open.
[11/08/23, 2:33:55 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Jokes apart, India AI space is just going to expand from here onwards, this is a good time to start some dedicated work. If someone get famous from here after that, I’ll humbly take the all credits.
[11/08/23, 2:58:45 PM] Aditya Agrawal: Anyone here who has used LinkedIn recruiter and LikedIn Sales at the same time?
[11/08/23, 3:17:53 PM] Aditya Agrawal: I’m not in support of creating personal directory of Startups or anything outside community. What do you guys think?

[11/08/23, 5:27:37 PM] ~ Rajiv Poddar: Or is it LLMs and GPU cloud?
[11/08/23, 5:37:30 PM] Anubhav Mishra AI: both i think, like build dojo supercomputer and then build x.ai

[11/08/23, 8:14:38 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: 90% of the events on this list are not worth attending. Most are just some VC hogwash for lead farming 🧺 or some VC backed company trying lead gen via webinars

If you're specifically looking for good events, I recommend Llama Lounge events or MLOps Community.

Everything is a Luma or Partiful link

This is totally possible in India. There's nothing special about these events 😂
[11/08/23, 8:43:51 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Here's a good event this month in SF

[12/08/23, 9:34:13 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Not really sure, these have been around since the days of Deepart.io; the good ol neural artistic style transfer

Not sure about numbers, probably read up a few substacks on Lensa or related StableDiff apps?
[12/08/23, 9:35:08 AM] Sudharshan Ai: Haha
[12/08/23, 9:38:52 AM] Sudharshan Ai: Yeah but these are different 

Mage space, pixAI, playground launched last year and dominate 

nightcafe, and older ai art generators were popular for using vqgan, disco diffusion etc. they’re mostly dead  


I know wonderAI (mobile app) does > 100K$/mo 

A lot of these products offer free credits to try on. 

Loads infact - assuming burn must be pretty high.
[12/08/23, 9:52:23 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: In that way just run through the free cloud credits? All three providers

Just make sure you find enough demand. Feels like a saturated market
[12/08/23, 10:01:58 AM] Sudharshan Ai: Hmm - can always niche out 

Comics, anime, illustrations, vector art etc
[12/08/23, 10:02:01 AM] Sudharshan Ai: Big TAM
[12/08/23, 10:02:21 AM] Sudharshan Ai: Not sure - they keep giving free credits daily
[12/08/23, 10:03:41 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Just gotta be smart about it. There's always credits 😊
[12/08/23, 10:04:39 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Interesting take! You may have heard this too many times on Twitter now

"There hasn't been a better time to start a company"
[12/08/23, 10:05:13 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Isn't your feed flooded with YC launches 

Copilot for X
GenAI for Y🥴
[12/08/23, 10:09:01 AM] Sudharshan Ai: True 

But I prefer building smaller AI SaaS’s - not startups. So more niche oriented
[12/08/23, 10:10:16 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: Majorly everything enterprise SaaS , b2b, very few I've seen are in consumer apart from a few who've got in AI Grant 1. ‎<This message was edited>
[12/08/23, 10:15:20 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: @919940474056 , there might be a trick, you can check an estimated market share on similarweb /semrush, not sure if their advanced analytics have revenue data too but you can try that out. They have a one month free trial without credit card info.
[12/08/23, 10:16:24 AM] Sudharshan Ai: Yup did that
[12/08/23, 10:16:28 AM] Sudharshan Ai: Revenue not shown

We did that back in 2018 lol. It's a zero sum game. Asked the founders some tough questions about their business they didn't have answers to, well I didn't either when I was building the same shit

Don't get carried away by the fancy of the valley. The best parties or best socials & events don't even matter.

Requesting to refer your friends to the Accel Atoms AI cohort - https://atoms.accel.com/ai
[15/08/23, 5:52:51 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Do share stats on acceptance rate, performance of previous cohort & any other useful data whenever the program begins

Will be useful for the community!
[15/08/23, 6:07:28 AM] Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai: 4000 applications in the first two cohorts 
24 companies 
$160M raised by the companies so far

Mind you the program is 20 months old, so companies need time to become bigger
[15/08/23, 6:15:56 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Interesting! So I'm sure you're looking for something special with a 0.6% acceptance rate

What are you looking for in founders & the businesses they're building. Is there a framework you guys use or go by gut? ‎<This message was edited>
[15/08/23, 6:30:47 AM] Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai: Actually we publish all our thought processes on the website. 

We have received close to 250 applications in AI cohort right now and have invited around 25 companies for interview
[15/08/23, 6:33:43 AM] Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai: Sorry the correct numbers are 150 for AI cohort and 22 invited for interview

[15/08/23, 6:01:22 PM] Anubhav Mishra AI: Don't think  Anthropic  will just build Claude as an end product, they will purely be after all the large/ medium size companies. Might be a leader in genAI KMS and tools.
[15/08/23, 6:04:57 PM] Anubhav Mishra AI: It would be really cool if someone might explain why post 450 mil raise they are raising 100 mil ( what deal structure) and also is it really so costly in terms of capital required?
[15/08/23, 6:10:39 PM] ~ Saurabh Karn: All the VCs in the house! 😅
[15/08/23, 6:12:03 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Some possible scenarios - 

1/ Wanted to raise more but couldn't 

2/ Maybe the first tranche of payments were for the hardware infra and now the second tranche is for talent
[15/08/23, 6:17:29 PM] ‪+91 99629 64599‬: Or could be a strategic investment + some data sharing agreements 😅
[15/08/23, 6:17:32 PM] ‪+91 90130 07300‬: It is a strategic deal aimed to built custom LLMs for telcos.
[15/08/23, 6:19:12 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Is that a big enough incentive for a company that's chasing AGI? 

I think Pi, OAI & Anthropic seem to be chasing B2C market as opposed to B2B
[15/08/23, 6:23:22 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: IMO these hw purchases are going to backfire big time as smaller customized models will start getting bigger chunks of the pie. Every enterprise customers I have talked to want to have their llama.
[15/08/23, 6:24:21 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: which is precisely why I do not think they're targeting enterprise use-cases at all
[15/08/23, 6:24:59 PM] ‪+91 90130 07300‬: It is definitely a large market with custom telco applications across customer service, sales, other interactive apps. The road to AGI is not clear and likely many steps
[15/08/23, 6:26:46 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Billions of funding, to get small chunk of customer acquisition cost for each verticals doesn’t make sense. B2C is where Apple, Google, MS and Amazon have better business established.
[15/08/23, 6:27:56 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: It’s AGI or bust for these 3-4 companies
[15/08/23, 7:07:08 PM] Anubhav Mishra AI: I think Pi ( inflection) will also look to provide it's Inflection models which is purely a personalized AI experience ( that's the claim) will attract a lot of b2b deals , from Mustafas podcasts and interviews I sense some ambitious statement that they want anyone who's looking to build a conversational OS will look to use I1 model. 

They want to be that platform that others use to build conv OS using their infra and model architecture/ APIs
[15/08/23, 7:07:58 PM] Anubhav Mishra AI: Precedent is that they have too opened access for the waitlist of their Inflection 1 API.
[15/08/23, 7:17:26 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Yeah, so here's why I think what I think - 

1/ OAI, Anthropic, Pi will have to do consumer because they're all fighting it out to be the best frontier model provider - if the focus is on enterprises, there's just no way they'll ever get any adoption, data, usage to be able to pursue their vision

2/ They all have APIs for sure but excluding maybe OAI, none of them are seriously pursuing b2b use-cases with sales teams, on the ground evangelists etc

3/ Most successful and iconic tech companies eventually do both b2b and b2c anyways - Apple, Google, Microsoft, Amazon
[15/08/23, 7:27:00 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Also I have been "thinking out loud" on this: providing API access to others could mean quite a few things - 

1/ Access to GPUs is limited - providing access to frontier model APIs could be a way for companies to consolidate usage on a few major platforms, play economies of scale & ensure efficient GPU utilization. 

2/ A bit far fetched but it also ensures that people begin using your APIs as opposed to building their own models and/or further developing/contributing to OSS models
[15/08/23, 7:28:40 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Sir, 

Isn't the bet that atleast one among OAI, Anthropic, Pi will be able to build a model that is better than theirs? And hence, disrupt/displace them to emerge as a winner in something? 

Of course, one/all of them might end up acquiring some/all of these companies but my read is that these 3 players aren't pursuing anything in the enterprise seriously for the time being
[15/08/23, 7:39:38 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Llama2 and all the hacking going around it have completely change these both, and that’s why they are all talking like that.
[15/08/23, 7:42:02 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: We should have another discussion on this some time :) 

Would be fun

But I still don't think there's any serious enterprise adoption of any Gen AI product today outside of OAI and the models made available to people via Amazon Bedrock or Google PaLM
[15/08/23, 7:42:58 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Agreed
[15/08/23, 7:43:24 PM] ‪+91 77954 00389‬: I agree with Pratyush,  economics of adapting these in present are not feasible.
[15/08/23, 7:43:28 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Let's not forget 30th Nov '23 was when ChatGPT launched - most serious F500 companies will have procurement cycles longer than ChatGPT's existence
[15/08/23, 7:44:34 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Serious F500 is another way of saying big banks, telcos, oil companies, physical retail stores etc - all of them who move the world's GDP today
[15/08/23, 7:48:49 PM] ‪+91 85850 10176‬: I’m interested to see how the ad revenue model evolves with these 
B2C apps by OAI etc. The biggest consumer apps have been “free” for users but absolute monsters in terms of ad revenue generation for the incumbents. Possible routes could be: 
1. App Store model via plugins - take a cut off transactions enabled
2. LLM SEM (links to sources based on spend by companies) 
3. Contextual ads side bar based on whatever topic the user enters 

Anyone gone deeper here?
[16/08/23, 11:16:13 AM] ‪+91 78068 59121‬: Hello everyone - we will be going through the responses tonight. Please fill it if you haven't.

[16/08/23, 11:54:46 AM] ‪+91 77022 55597‬: Yes, I do. I also don't think the need for IT services will go away soon.
[16/08/23, 11:59:48 AM] Anshul Bhide Replit: Thanks for this article; super interesting. I think in the short term, on the supply side we'll see that some of the cost benefits flow to IT providers margins (e.g. a script that previously look 5 engineers now will take 3 engineers with Gen AI). But I agree with this article that eventually IT customers will try and renegotiate contracts (especially T&M ones) with IT providers and that cost benefit will move to customers. So you'll likely see more outcome based projects than T&M projects.
[16/08/23, 12:10:53 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Clickbait. From the title, it sounds GenAI helped to set the world record. "Fans of all ages were able to ask questions and engage in conversation with the record-breaking car via the generative AI-powered interface, which told them everything they wanted to know about the race and the performance of the cars shooting past them.”
[16/08/23, 12:12:21 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Why anyone will use GenAI with real-time data analysis, I'm sure some Fortune 500 executives will spend 250-500K to explore.
[16/08/23, 12:13:10 PM] ‪+91 77022 55597‬: I meant "will not".

[16/08/23, 12:14:36 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: IT services will still be required, I guess both of us are saying the same thing?
[16/08/23, 12:14:38 PM] ‪+91 77022 55597‬: The need for IT services will not go away anytime soon.
[16/08/23, 12:14:50 PM] ‪+91 77022 55597‬: Yes/
[16/08/23, 12:15:23 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Quite a lot of thoughts/questions on that - let me ping you 1:1
[16/08/23, 12:15:30 PM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: We can then share a summary w/ others here
[16/08/23, 1:14:05 PM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: Hi everyone,

Does anyone want SaaStr - US '23 tickets? (saastrannual2023.com)

I have a discounted ticket but I won't be able to travel because of certain VISA issues :/ SaaStr team doesn't allow refunds, but they have agreed to transfer it (see https://prnt.sc/tnj-8Rkx4qs_)

The ticket is heavily discounted - *724 USD* as opposed to 1449 USD current price (see https://prnt.sc/_SdRMs5l0kT2). Willing to transfer it at the same price.

Kindly let me know asap since it is time sensitive. Plz DM. Thanks.
[16/08/23, 1:26:07 PM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: Hi folks, this is done, thanks
[16/08/23, 1:30:28 PM] Dhruv Anand: Does anyone have a large monthly spend on OpenAI APIs, and looking to save some money in the short term? I can probably help with that. Please get in touch
[16/08/23, 1:33:36 PM] Rohit Agarwal Portkey Ai: +1 

I’m also happy to help founders with cost, latency and other challenges with OpenAI!
[16/08/23, 1:42:59 PM] Dhruv Anand: To be clear, I'm talking about direct savings, not usage optimisation
[16/08/23, 3:04:16 PM] Chaitanya Soari AI: Anyone from here going to the SF Bay Area During SaaStr or the week after? I will be there. I would love to catch-up. Please DM.

Founders are currently shipping AI products at 10x speed but with the new UI/UX of OpenAI which is very different from the intuitive design consumers are accustomed to.

​Products that are shipped in the market are quite complex. On this note, the question is how we can bring the AI founders community and Designer Community together.

​We are hosting a Design x Founder Meetup with Accel in a simple format of 30 Designers and 30 Founders powered by a speaker session discussing on User Intuitive Gen AI Products.

[21/08/23, 2:51:06 PM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: What do you mean openAI is outdated?
[21/08/23, 2:51:52 PM] ‪+91 73892 76189‬: I guess he was referring to the cut off date of open ai models

[21/08/23, 7:52:59 PM] Rachitt Shah Ai: serpapi returns just the Google search result afaik?

then you'll need to pass the URLs obtained via serp to your scraper to get more context
[21/08/23, 7:54:05 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Yep! It's not the best. We are reconsidering it but there aren't any good options out there
[21/08/23, 7:57:06 PM] Rachitt Shah Ai: I've used webbase loader from langchain for text scraping for context and playwright for specific schemas, they work decently well
[21/08/23, 8:01:20 PM] Dev Aggarwal AI: You need both scraper + vector search pass to make this work well for the general case

[22/08/23, 1:01:42 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: @918056288640 time to plan a gathering for folks in SF from the group
[22/08/23, 1:14:03 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Let's do it!
[22/08/23, 3:31:17 AM] Nitin Mahajan 88 Vc: If you do during Saastr Seo 6-8 then I will also gatecrash the party. Visiting SF Sep 5-10
[22/08/23, 3:33:46 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Just doing SaaStr or SaaSBOOMi caravan as well?
[22/08/23, 3:33:59 AM] Nitin Mahajan 88 Vc: Just saastr
[22/08/23, 3:34:12 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: you're missing out
[22/08/23, 3:34:43 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Anyways, can put something together for the evening of Sep 14th if you're still around
[22/08/23, 3:35:41 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: will probably drop a poll at the beginning of Sep
[22/08/23, 1:30:58 PM] Sahir AI: hi , has anyone here applied for the openai credits by Microsoft for startups ? I got the azure access , but didn't get an update from openai for a week now
[22/08/23, 1:41:44 PM] ‪+91 85609 53375‬: I did. Have got the credits as well. They don't send notification, check your billing in openai, it will show up there.

[23/08/23, 4:23:31 AM] Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai: Why would you handover 10% for $150K ... When so many angel syndicates, seed funds and accelerators in India will give you a lot more money for the 10%? ‎<This message was edited>
[23/08/23, 4:28:27 AM] Enkrypt.ai Prashant AI: It might benefit someone in this community. Yes, better valuation terms are available. No doubt.
[23/08/23, 6:03:39 AM] Aditya Agrawal: Building tech startup in US with 150k might be peanuts.
[23/08/23, 6:03:46 AM] Abhilash Reclaim Protocal AI: ‎Your security code with Abhilash Reclaim Protocal AI changed.
[23/08/23, 6:05:18 AM] Kartik Springworks: their value add is not money but the visa/immigration which for many immigrants is the most important thing. This is not something YC etc will do
[23/08/23, 6:07:24 AM] Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai: Again a lot of investors in India help founders in getting visas
[23/08/23, 6:08:16 AM] Neha Nupoor Yc: YC helps with O1, 3 basic criterias are met with the YC funding and Letter of recommendation.
[23/08/23, 6:10:12 AM] Kartik Springworks: Got it. I'm not an expert but from my personal experience 10 years ago - O1s are harder than h1b. Indian investors do help but from what I know Unshackled takes you on their payroll
[23/08/23, 6:11:12 AM] Neha Nupoor Yc: o1 is harder yes. thats where the selection works out well for founders. If unshackled takes you on their payroll, i am not sure how you will own the shares and the company on h1b
[23/08/23, 6:11:31 AM] Neha Nupoor Yc: founders on h1b in YC had to quit and figure out a visa situation.
[23/08/23, 6:12:08 AM] Neha Nupoor Yc: math is not math-ing for me 🤔
[23/08/23, 6:18:27 AM] Nitin Mahajan 88 Vc: O1 is also getting over subscribed and backlogged now. In the last 1 year I know people who have figured out how to get O1done.

O1 is the new H1 🥷✅
[23/08/23, 6:26:18 AM] Kartik Springworks: Yes that’s possible. You can do that
[23/08/23, 6:33:22 AM] Enkrypt.ai Prashant AI: I am not associated with the program, so I might be wrong. From my understanding, this is meant to pre-pre-seed stage (zygote 😁 couldn't help containing the joke) and idea exploration/experimentation. If one is thinking of a bigger investment/team formation then others have mentioned more suitable alternatives.
[23/08/23, 6:38:11 AM] Aditya Agrawal: US Visa is bad and no matter which new program will get bad over time. They have tried it with H1, EB5, O1, L1 etc etc .. the problem is the world wants to be in US and US is reluctant to have leaders in the country. So this is there throttle to that.
[23/08/23, 6:38:26 AM] Aditya Agrawal: they bring in*
[23/08/23, 6:49:56 AM] Ankesh Atlasian AI: It doesn't matter if there are a lot of investors already, the founder / investor dynamic is still highly skewed in favour of investors, so it is a good thing for founders to have more options.
[23/08/23, 6:52:29 AM] ‪+91 99020 88930‬: Another axis to think of is whether you would want to give away 10% at zygote stage
[23/08/23, 7:04:40 AM] Aditya Agrawal: The best way to decide on an accelerator is to talk to some portfolio companies of theirs. Pick some from recent cohorts and some from at least 3 years before . Talk to them candidly. No one other than them can give specifics.
[23/08/23, 7:19:46 AM] ~ Rajiv Poddar: Hack your way through it. On B1/B2 you can stay for 6 months at a time. Spend a month or so in SFO every quarter. Build in India and visit frequently.
[23/08/23, 7:21:11 AM] Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai: This is the best approach.
[23/08/23, 7:54:31 AM] Bhavya e/acc: Have a school friend who's a founder (https://www.obviously.ai/) and has secured the O1 if anyone wishes to chat.
[23/08/23, 8:58:51 AM] ~ Prashant Singh: Here is what works most of the time : (1) Incorporate a Delaware C Corp (2) establish a fully owned indian sub (3) Show your self an employee of Indian Sub (2) get invite to any of big event (Google IO/ Apple WWDC /Salesforce Dreamforce or get a visa invite from your friend in FAANG on their letterhead (3) Apply for B1 you will get it smoothly (4) make 2-3 trips of one month each  in the first  year that would be sufficient (5) the moment you have 1 Year complete on the payroll of Indian Sub you are eligible for O1 -Inter company transfer (6) Hire a good lawyer it will cost a bit of money but you will get O1 .
[23/08/23, 9:01:59 AM] Bhavya e/acc: Interesting. But wouldn't they suspect one is doing this for being eligible for the O1. US has a bed rep with people trying to cut corners (open to be proven wrong.)
[23/08/23, 9:04:10 AM] ~ Prashant Singh: Law enforcement everywhere is mostly about compliance to the letter of the law not spirit of the law .. that's for court .
[23/08/23, 9:06:48 AM] Bhavya e/acc: Who'd risk deportation after spending so much? 
A better way could be to build in India and apply for the business VISA ($750K) post seed round?
[23/08/23, 9:07:02 AM] Bhavya e/acc: Visa*
[23/08/23, 9:08:13 AM] ~ Pratiksha | Graphia.AI: why not just be employee of delware c corp & show 1 year payroll?
[23/08/23, 9:09:20 AM] ~ Prashant Singh: some accounting and payroll thing .
[23/08/23, 9:15:38 AM] Aditya Agrawal: quick question: Is anyone looking to apply and move at this point? or are we just sharing these for the sake of sharing?
[23/08/23, 9:22:58 AM] Mayank Gupta: Also the additional question if anyone has any experience to share - Is it worth it? Are there significant differences in any of the aspects of company building (hiring, raising etc) and which ones apart from there being a larger access of businesses to sell to? ‎<This message was edited>
[23/08/23, 9:29:33 AM] ~ Prashant Singh: "Are there significant differences any of the segments apart from selling?"
[23/08/23, 9:30:22 AM] ~ Prashant Singh: I am not sure if i understand . Are you asking is there any benefit of a presence in US other than sales close fast
[23/08/23, 9:31:11 AM] Mayank Gupta: Sorry corrected it to make it more explanatory - but yeah that's what I was trying to ask
[23/08/23, 9:34:19 AM] ~ Prashant Singh: YMMV but I think almost everything gets better there other than living conditions ( crime /rent ) and Runway (cost burn ). you think differently ..don't reinvent a lot of stuff. in general, dealing with smart-driven ppl is good . Plust face time helps in closing the round .
[23/08/23, 9:40:42 AM] Bhavya e/acc: I am curious now - do Indian founders create enterprises as a means to shift to US? 🤔
[23/08/23, 9:42:10 AM] Aditya Agrawal: This is valuable I’ll try this
[23/08/23, 9:42:59 AM] Aditya Agrawal: But probably with H1
[23/08/23, 9:45:48 AM] Bhavya e/acc: This might be such a turn down for people funding them. How does one identify such ventures and founders? Any VC/seasoned angel would like to weigh in?
[23/08/23, 9:48:05 AM] ~ Prashant Singh: this is not what it is about : Founders want to make global business . one thing which help is to have a presence in US .
[23/08/23, 9:48:44 AM] Aditya Agrawal: @917567675121 are these random questions or you building something?
[23/08/23, 9:50:22 AM] ~ Prashant Singh: Please dont worry about VCs.  They often reco to  have company in Delaware /martitus /singapore / Dubai . Incorporation / Stock issuance / Closing down , liquidation everything is more smooth that way .
[23/08/23, 9:56:18 AM] Bhavya e/acc: ‎You removed Bhavya e/acc
[23/08/23, 10:23:27 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Waiting for WhatsApp to launch it's own version of Twitter Spaces

Then we can have weekly discussions on topics like these

Anyone has a warm intro to Zuck? 🦦
[23/08/23, 10:27:30 AM] ~ Vamshi: Anyone here has experience issuing equity in a Delaware C in exchange for services ? Does it necessarily involve going to an expensive law firm?

India based founder, incorporated using firstbase. 

I understand that the FEMA relations have changed since late last year making it impossible issue the equity in exchange for a nominal transfer, while still being FEMA compliant.
[23/08/23, 10:27:46 AM] ~ Vamshi: *FEMA regulations
[23/08/23, 10:29:05 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: It's a bit tricky to incorporate with services like First base & Stripe Atlas since they are not well aware of India laws 

All YC & Techstars companies go to Inventus Law
[23/08/23, 10:29:29 AM] ~ Vamshi: Ok - I did speak with Inventus
[23/08/23, 10:29:43 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: They're expensive, but takes one worry away from you as a founder
[23/08/23, 10:30:32 AM] ~ Vamshi: Good to know this, I got a thumbs up for them from multiple people
[23/08/23, 10:31:17 AM] ‪+91 73892 76189‬: +1 for Inventus, pretty smooth experience with them.
[23/08/23, 10:35:10 AM] ~ Vamshi: Thanks

[23/08/23, 11:00:38 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Not sure of exact commercials. Please connect with Anil Advani from Inventus on LinkedIn 😊
[23/08/23, 11:01:04 AM] ~ Prashant Singh: Same guy

[23/08/23, 11:03:02 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Biased, since Anil didn't charge me a penny until I raised my seed
[23/08/23, 11:04:51 AM] ~ Prashant Singh: same with me but he asked me not to tell anyone :P
[23/08/23, 11:06:02 AM] ~ Prashant Singh: poor guy he only get seed stage starving founder when they Series A they go with some white shoe type law firms
[23/08/23, 11:07:25 AM] ~ Vamshi: What was the time period between incorporation and your first use of the entity (presumably to formalise the seed round) ?
[23/08/23, 11:07:36 AM] ~ Vamshi: If you don’t mind me asking
[23/08/23, 11:08:08 AM] ~ Vamshi: Or I can take this off on dm - but I’m guessing this is useful if it’s not confidential
[23/08/23, 11:08:17 AM] ~ Vamshi: Useful for all that is
[23/08/23, 11:09:08 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Let's take it to DMs
[23/08/23, 11:09:14 AM] ~ Vamshi: Alright !
[23/08/23, 11:15:00 AM] Aditya Agrawal: @918056288640 I also need some guidance on this will DM you

[23/08/23, 11:53:58 AM] ‪+91 93400 04079‬: Do people really need Hindi/indic language LLMs?
[23/08/23, 11:55:25 AM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: Why not? If you need intelligence embedded in every app, you need something more aligned to the users being served. LLMs are also evolving into platform.
[23/08/23, 11:55:48 AM] ‪+91 93400 04079‬: Could you list usecases?
[23/08/23, 11:55:52 AM] ‪+91 6290 403 354‬: Optimized heavily for indic languages - things like using different tokenizers, improving performance on indic languages at the cost of that on others, and Indian audiences - trading off some performance for cost benefits as the cost dynamics are very different here
[23/08/23, 11:56:50 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Wasn't the Jio CoE for AI already doing a lot of stuff around this?

[23/08/23, 2:17:30 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: We have served 100k+ voice requests in different Indian languages by now and we havent even focused on marketing or reach out, voice feature is organically helping to get new users.
[23/08/23, 6:23:12 PM] Neha Nupoor Yc: Charged us 7k for a drawn process but with YC discount. The regulations changed last year for india and it has been a mess to issue stocks recently. Ensure you get the right timelines from them

[23/08/23, 6:57:37 PM] Neha Nupoor Yc: At Uber, voice from India was quite high. Indians cant use english keyboards and cheaper phone dont make it easy to type. Voice is preferred
[23/08/23, 6:57:59 PM] Neha Nupoor Yc: Even for children voice is the bigger mode of interaction since they cant type

[24/08/23, 7:04:06 AM] Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai: Folks as a VC who has seen this from pre seed all the way to pre-IPO. I strongly request you all to carefully spend time on the right incorporation. 

My two cents .. a number of our companies are now incorporating in India and not in US. If you are a good company money will find you even if you are India incorporated.

[25/08/23, 12:30:34 PM] Sahir AI: hi , you mean for training images , you wanted AI generated images of diseased animals?
[25/08/23, 12:36:36 PM] Anubhav Mishra AI: Hey, you can try with specific prompts I guess, it's a very specific use case.
[25/08/23, 12:39:26 PM] ‪+91 85609 53375‬: We have faced the same issue with plants earlier. This was before Midjourney happened. Tried GAN but the classification results were bad with the artifically generated images against the real images. We actually went on to work on a different classification model architecture that worked with uneven dataset.
[25/08/23, 1:47:01 PM] ~ Kshitij Agrawal: You can possibly generate 10-20% of data, maybe if you are able to identify a good prompt / inpainting or img2img strategy. The additional risk is going to be the domain difference b/w generated images vs real. 
What's your current performance? this is a naturally imbalanced problem and should be able to handle with loss functions and model architecture.
[25/08/23, 2:13:48 PM] Anubhav Mishra AI: @918754820702 here is an idea, not sure if it work, if the disease is something that make changes in the appearance physically ( identified by symptoms) you can specially mentions those in the prompt.

[26/08/23, 5:49:47 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Anyone using GPT neo in production?
[26/08/23, 5:53:35 PM] Aishwarya Goel AI: Yes, and similar cold-start reductions for diffusion, Llama models which companies are using in production with us. Want to follow the community rules, not self-promote, feel free to DM if you want to learn more :)
[26/08/23, 5:57:16 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: I am asking for benchmarks from other folks, that's not promotion. Sharing a webinar link for a single company is 😊 
Hosting a 1.3B param model is still easy
Good that you're doing Llama models too, I couldn't try it on your website 😕
We have publicly available Llama APIs 🙂
[26/08/23, 5:59:41 PM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: As fine tuning becomes more popular, it would be easier to have a shared base model and decoupled additive models. Hopefully that leads to a reduced cold start problem
[26/08/23, 6:00:41 PM] Dev Aggarwal AI: One hacky solution is to swap models between ram and gpu, that way you can pack many models into a machine with limited gpu memory and still get nice cold starts since moving between gpu and ram is fast. 

Falls apart when you have higher usage and need to scale instances but works well for the initial launch
[26/08/23, 6:04:27 PM] Dev Aggarwal AI: https://www.lamini.ai/blog/one-billion-times-faster-finetuning-with-lamini-peft

Also came across this
[26/08/23, 6:04:43 PM] Dev Aggarwal AI: > Our solution is Parameter Efficient Finetuning (PEFT) [1], which freezes most weights during finetuning, only updating small subsets of weights, called adapters, using backpropagation. The adapters only need 10-30MB storage instead of tens of GBs for the entire model ‎<This message was edited>

[27/08/23, 5:46:19 AM] Shikhil Kumar Gupta Ai: Hello everyone, I have questions in content AI based project. 

I'm currently investigating the feasibility of directly converting Figma designs into React code, avoiding the need to create React components from scratch. Is there a chance that we can accomplish this using any available open-source tools? I've come across a paid AI plugin for Figma designed to perform this conversion, but I'm uncertain about its effectiveness and overall value. Has anyone come across an open-source alternative to achieve this? If so, I'd greatly appreciate it if you could share your insights.
[27/08/23, 6:14:56 AM] ‪+91 97410 11105‬: Do you come across any paid tool which creates quality react components from figma?

[28/08/23, 10:00:10 AM] Anshul Bhide Replit: Gushworks raised $2m, segmind raised $1m, workhack raised $1.5m

[28/08/23, 10:05:37 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: I've run my calculations far too many times & that's always the base number you would need to break into any market 

You need at least $1M in ARR for your next raise or substantial user growth both of which are cutting to close with a low raise

You will never be working on the thing you started with

It's all nothing but a bunch of pivots to break $$ in the devtools & SaaS market
[28/08/23, 10:06:17 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Sorry, but completely and politely disagree
[28/08/23, 10:06:27 AM] ‪+1 (442) 245‑0480‬: In terms of burn/runway? I can't see why most founders couldn't run a company for 24 months on $1.5M
[28/08/23, 10:06:29 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: You will need capital

Everything comes at a price
[28/08/23, 10:06:30 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: Look at the companies that are building in Consumer AI. Sizzle AI a self study for kids in the US raised a seed of 7.5 mil
[28/08/23, 10:07:20 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: I'm still running one! And I don't recommend it

To sound resilient at the expense of dishonesty would not be right
[28/08/23, 10:07:29 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: For starters, it's tough to raise money even if you hit $1M ARR when you burned $3M out of the $4.4M you raised to get there
[28/08/23, 10:09:32 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: What's your days?
[28/08/23, 10:09:35 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: *data
[28/08/23, 10:10:12 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: If you're asking sample set, I'd say it's well over 100 companies across India & US
[28/08/23, 10:10:31 AM] ‪+44 7454 000258‬: The fact of the matter is for every number you can come up with, there’ll be 3 companies that match that and 1 counterexample
[28/08/23, 10:10:51 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: DevTools or general
[28/08/23, 10:11:07 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: You know where I spend most of my time :)
[28/08/23, 10:11:47 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Alright, it's all crunchbase data but I've spoken to founders building devtools from India & ground truth is different
[28/08/23, 10:12:04 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: *or Pitchbook
[28/08/23, 10:12:22 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: I don't have paid subscriptions of either Crunchbase or Pitchbook sir
[28/08/23, 10:14:10 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Question: Are these seed numbers coming from Indian VCs and US VCs different?
[28/08/23, 10:15:42 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: I just want to honestly know as It helps me to plan mine. I am completely unware of Indian VC space.
[28/08/23, 10:16:26 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Take an example

Fixie, raised $17M as seed

Has pivoted twice
[28/08/23, 10:16:35 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Since seed announcement 😂
[28/08/23, 10:17:21 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: I'm also assuming that Indian GenAI startups are being placed to compete with the US ones, as GenAI has no border limitations.
[28/08/23, 10:17:45 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: Let me elaborate a little bit here - 

1/ If one is in a new category creation play, $1M ARR is seldom enough to get to the next round. What (good) people care about is if they have solid metrics to show they're either at or on track to PMF. 

For instance, if you're trying to build a new category (essentially a new way of doing specific dev workflows) & you have $1.5M ARR coming from India/SEA/Bangalore/Koramangala & Indiranagar, you might find it hard to secure the next round of funding

2/ If you're playing in an existing category (where the budgets and buyer personas are well defined), you'll likely not need that much capital to get to $1M ARR - this is of course assuming you'd deploy some capital efficient GTM strategies &/or some underlying platform shifts
[28/08/23, 10:19:23 AM] Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai: I think people forget the power of the $1-3M rounds ... Flipkart ($800K), Freshworks ($1M), Zetwerk ($1M), Chargebee ($1M), Swiggy ($2M) ... the high seed round game is a broad generic statement ... it depends on the company and their market.
[28/08/23, 10:19:49 AM] Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai: Now folks will argue that to win US market people need minimum $10M
[28/08/23, 10:20:05 AM] Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai: And I agree, but to get to PMF you dont need $17M
[28/08/23, 10:20:20 AM] Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai: Langchain got $10M after the product was frikking popular.
[28/08/23, 10:21:26 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: And I don't think $1M (or thereabouts) ARR will get them to their next round of funding
[28/08/23, 10:21:36 AM] Anshul Bhide Replit: Llamaindex too - 8.5M
[28/08/23, 10:21:42 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: I am no VC but which years were these seed rounds raised?
[28/08/23, 10:22:04 AM] Anshul Bhide Replit: And that’s only after they had some idea of PMF
[28/08/23, 10:25:51 AM] ‪+91 99629 64599‬: You should definitely give this a try. Customers have been able to get production grade output with minimal effort from figma files. Also working closely with figma 

disclaimer: we are investors 😅
[28/08/23, 10:26:08 AM] Aakrit Vaish Haptik AI: For true PMF I don't think any software product needs more than 3-5m no matter what market
[28/08/23, 10:26:29 AM] Aakrit Vaish Haptik AI: Anything more is just safety / founder ego / VCs paying up to win the deal 🙂 ‎<This message was edited>
[28/08/23, 10:28:01 AM] Aakrit Vaish Haptik AI: By software I mean it could be B2B B2C whatever.. Any true tech product
[28/08/23, 10:28:04 AM] ‪+91 99629 64599‬: Interesting passed on to the founder
[28/08/23, 10:28:27 AM] Nitin Mahajan 88 Vc: 2 cents worth in this debate where there are no answers - raising before having a prototype and some sense of PMF leads to lower capital ask, burn, and number of pivots. SaaS (or micros saas in my case) should be following this approach of get a PMF before asking >2M$. For 100-200k you can frugally run for 6-9 months and get a validation. 

Of course, if you are a good storyteller or making infra that does require signficant upfront capital to build a poc then things are different. SaaS and micro-saas should be encouraged differently (as many VCs are also beginning to also now talk).
[28/08/23, 10:29:40 AM] Pratyush Choudhury Together.Fund Ai: I'm inclined to agree but $3-5M is still stretching it - in the last 2 years, have seen companies in B2B get there w/ much less 

$1M ARR in 18-24 months w/ $1.5M-ish burn
[28/08/23, 10:30:09 AM] Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai: Raising capital should not depend on which year you raise, but on what the business needs. This is the biggest problem I see today. Companies raise huge rounds $10M for 10% dilution - since some VCs are desperate to put money. Now, next round needs to happen at $200M at least ? Then if you get valued at 10X revenue - you need $20M revenue. I have never seen any SaaS company that has gotten to $20M revenue in $10M raise from seed. 

Seed rounds happen for all sorts of reasons easy to point to the biggest round say everyone wants the same round. But out 100 rounds maybe 2 seed rounds are like that. If you want outside the norm seed rounds, then please be an outside the norm company with an outside the norm team.
[28/08/23, 10:31:07 AM] Aakrit Vaish Haptik AI: Haan I meant maxxxxx 🙂

Basic workflow SaaS id argue is best built bootstrapped if you've identified a niche complex problem
[28/08/23, 10:33:38 AM] ‪+91 95605 22239‬: Sorry to interrupt the debate. WorkHack here, bas badhiya honest kaam karna chahiye, baaki toh sab variable hai 😌
[28/08/23, 10:33:53 AM] Nitin Mahajan 88 Vc: Fully agree @919819046942. SaaS isn't a winner take all and PMF doesnt need expensive account managers to be hired in US. Prove karo phir decide karo the GTM scale-up model and capital requirements.

I would dare argue (as I am biased) that SMB SaaS didn't do this. New companies will avoid this mistake of raising too much and setting up for a non VC like return
[28/08/23, 10:44:44 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: PMF is good in theory, and as founders, no one cares more about PMF than us. But I'm sure many of your current seed investments don't have a PMF. And I'm only talking about GenAI, not Generic SaaS tools, because you can count GenAi companies on your finger that has PMF. So how does the valuation difference work in GenAI.
[28/08/23, 10:45:53 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: These Indian founders are asked to come to SF to find customers and be align with what is going on, in that case 200-300K someone mentions won't work.
[28/08/23, 11:15:44 AM] Hemant Mohapatra Lightspeed Ai: Interesting discussion :) As a VC who's deployed capital into the US (a16z) and now in India+SEA (Lightspeed), here are my learnings:
1/ if you want to understand a fund's strategy on check size, valuations, ownership, ask not what they believe is the "right" answer, ask for their fund size 😉 
2/ biggest mental block in genAI founders in india vs US - x raised 100M, why can I only raise 10M. Trust me, if a transformer paper author or CPO of a public market co starts a new company from india, the indian VCs will likely pool together that 100M too. 
3/ ambition matters -- how will the world change fundamentally if you were to succeed? Relative to the US, most founders especially in India market struggle to do this part right but it's critical at the seed/A stage where much of the upside is in the future. Trust me, I know most founders will say 'but.. but.. my idea was the most ambitious thing since chandrayan2' but there is no excuse today if you are on twitter to not be self-aware and intellectually honest..
4/ as a CEO (and i speak as a failed founder in past life), one has only 3 jobs: raise capital (from VCs if you are looking to build a venture outcome; otherwise there are other alternatives better suited), hire the best team, and set strategy. At the start lots of other execution related stuff will bleed into your role, but eventually these 3 are where biggest alpha concentrates over time. 
5/ on the "raising capital" bit, the best founders in every markets *can* raise top decile round sizes; again to know what top decile is depends on total AUM available in and for that market and comparing two different markets without that nuance is purely an academic exercise. The however inverse is not true -- we've also seen best founders start with small rounds (e.g. acceldata seed was < 3m in 2018-19 -- not too long ago; they've raised 90m total). 
6/ no amount of capital can help you reach pmf if you don't know how to get there but it certainly buys you more time; devtools need more bake time but interestingly enough also have least correlation to success vs capital raised; Our portco supabase has raised a ton but barely touched much of that capital e.g.
7/ so, what should you raise? it's like asking what should the stock price for a company be worth -- it is worth what the market thinks it is worth; period... as a founder if you can convince the market it's worth high, great and congrats for having that rare talent - now go and execute behind that promise or you are just pushing eventual death out by another few years that's all; and if you can't convince the market today of that, no worries -- a majority of companies that eventually broke out played the long game and kept building. 

one person's view but happy to die on most of these hills :)
[28/08/23, 11:21:30 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Accel & Supabase are different businesses but what stage/raise were they at when they crossed $1M in ARR?
[28/08/23, 11:26:00 AM] Hemant Mohapatra Lightspeed Ai: Are you asking the question because you think every company in the world at that scale of ARR should get the same amount of funding correlated to the respective market averages? If yes, fundamentally misaligned with you on principle. If not the, question isn't going to help the group converge to an answer on what's the correct raise size for a company relative to the stage they're at.
[28/08/23, 11:26:56 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Neither. But you didn't answer my question 😊
[28/08/23, 11:29:23 AM] Hemant Mohapatra Lightspeed Ai: Accurate observation; because it wasn't going to drive convergence on the topic at hand :)
[28/08/23, 11:32:03 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Off topic: Grateful for the GenAI wave. 5 years ago VC wouldn't share their contacts & would ask you to send an email with the deck

Now we're all discussing in the same WA group

This is amazing for our ecosystem & it will only get better over time 

Hat tip to Nirant Kasliwal 🙏
[28/08/23, 11:37:27 AM] Aditya Agrawal: @918056288640 : I think SAAS is also a big/good ecosystem in India. And we have seen founder + VC come together to solve for it.
[28/08/23, 11:37:47 AM] Aditya Agrawal: the whole point of community is different set come together to solve for it.
[28/08/23, 11:44:16 AM] Swadeep Pillarisetti Wipro: Lovin' this! Brilliant insights. Actually strongly echo with almost every single one of them 

Having said that, have seen multiple cases as outliers (>10%), not such great ideas / founders getting higher fundraises done (>$5M seeds), and good teams picking up smaller seeds. 

On 3/ Many of the founders are truly ambitious and are building on truly game changing ideas, problem is that they aren't able to articulate it as well sometimes as the other competitor counterparts or the VC isn't able to see it early enough 

On 4/ one minor tweak: one could replace the goal of a Founder / CEO from _raising capital_ with _selling the vision_ : be it with VCs, key hires and even initial customers
[28/08/23, 11:51:33 AM] Swadeep Pillarisetti Wipro: I think the core qs is: how much $ does an early stage Gen AI startup need to attain PMF? $1M-$1.5M, $3-$5M, or higher? On average, US vs India

Do we even have a large enough dataset to make that conclusion for true Gen AI first startups. We may need a year or so more no?
[28/08/23, 12:08:53 PM] Aditya Agrawal: Sir by that time we will already be seeing M&A phase of AI ‎<This message was edited>
[28/08/23, 12:10:19 PM] Aditya Agrawal: In India, we have 1000+ AI Founders and there are only top 3-4 VC firms from which everyone wants to raise for all the good and known reasons in the community.

[28/08/23, 12:21:18 PM] Swadeep Pillarisetti Wipro: Most of which will be less than 2 years old, maybe even 12 months old. 

How many of these 1,000 have actually raised funding, and of them how many have attained PMF?
[28/08/23, 12:22:07 PM] Aditya Agrawal: How long you think it takes for Startups to find a PMF?
[28/08/23, 12:37:33 PM] Swadeep Pillarisetti Wipro: Less than a year but many times longer
[28/08/23, 12:38:39 PM] Swadeep Pillarisetti Wipro: Again, you didn't answer my qs here. Leading to my qs: do we have enough data to reach a reasonable conclusion

[29/08/23, 7:33:26 AM] ‪+91 99458 85649‬: On point 1, let me tell a story. Back in 2003, I was building a product that was going to cut hardware design capture from 8 months to 4 weeks or less. Everything was going amazing, smashing demos, paid pilots with large players like IBM, Apple, etc, even got a couple of awards for best product in the domain. Went to the market, and suddenly, there were no takers. Took a long time to figure it out, which we eventually did. The point is that PMF is hard to gauge. Is 1st 10 paid customers PMF, or 1st 1M dollars, or a survey of 100 potential customers giving thumbs up. Recently, I worked with a startup doing $20 million ARR, but everyone internally agrees that PMF is yet to be achieved.

On 2, in my mind, a GenAI startup would be one that is solving a problem using GenAI that none of the existing tools can solve more efficiently. Having said that, I personally dont prefer categorization that is tech first and not problem first.
[29/08/23, 8:10:04 AM] ~ Rajiv Poddar: 1/ PMF would be high mom growth on OpenAI bill. 

2/ Wrapper on Foundational Models. 🤣
[29/08/23, 8:14:15 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Only Nvidia is the GenAI company, everyone else is a wrapper.
[29/08/23, 8:29:43 AM] Dev Aggarwal AI: 1/ If you’re in b2c you’ll just know from your stripe graph & happy emails from people. In b2b its I think the repeat renewal is a good sign, but its much more complex and you have to really talk to the individuals at the other company to figure out what’s going on.

[29/08/23, 8:44:35 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Made-up Opportunistic Answer in Transition - MOAT

[29/08/23, 8:12:51 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: okay, @918763968157 asked "How to measure PMF quantitatively"

Dheeraj:

1.) Repeatability: are you selling more by Q3-Q4
2.) Expansion: are these customers ready to buy new products from you next year
3.) Trust: will the customer put himself/herself on the line to put their face & their company logo on your site/socials?

"You will have PMF issues at 1M, at 10 and even at 1B in ARR"

[01/09/23, 12:04:45 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Yesterday I spoke to Dev from Lightspeed

A burning question was where is $1B in revenue coming from for ChatGPT

Another founder mentioned it's $140M in subscriptions by consumers & the rest is unknown

Dev replied that Lightspeed is doing some research themselves & trying to figure this out 

Here's my hypothesis: It's coming from integrations across Office suite products & Bing. Those requests would be in billions per month & they come at a price 💸

What is the group thinking about this?

Also, then how does the future evolve around GTM + monetisation for anyone building building in this space: for apps not foundation models
[01/09/23, 12:31:23 AM] ‪+44 7454 000258‬: Theres definitely a microsoft component but also they were definitely doing enterprise access deals before the official enterprise access ‎<This message was edited>

[01/09/23, 12:36:33 AM] Dev Khare Lightspeed: Thx Anshuman. Doing this fundamental work to get past the hype and figure where actual dollars are coming from. I suspect it is microsoft itself (perhaps reciprocal on cloud), tech/saas companies, full stack services wrapped around AI (eg marketing, legal) and some consumer use cases (media, entertainment). Direct enterprise spend is mostly POCs still, I'm  hearing.  Any leads from you all to figure this out, we are happy to follow up on. We will publish our findings once we get there.
[01/09/23, 12:39:57 AM] Dev Khare Lightspeed: (And this work we are doing applies not just to OpenAI and text oriented FMs but also other companies as well as video and audio uses from OpenAI, Midjourney, Cohere  Stability, etc)
[01/09/23, 12:48:20 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: (1) 140M from just subscription, assuming API based usage bill from orgs must be higher cumulatively 
(2) do you think MS is paying some royalties on hosted models for office and Bing applications? I thought the deal with MS was about getting models for free, i may be wrong.

[01/09/23, 5:10:36 AM] Brij Singh Rebright Partners: Thanks Dev, do you have insights on what type of Enterprise POCs are gaining traction? Are these supporting use cases like knowledge graph / conversational search / automations etc or are you hearing companies already working on deep product / core IP integrations? Or perhaps it’s a bit of both. 

Would be good to get a picture of internal demand / need and what we can expect coming out in next 6-12 months.
[01/09/23, 7:58:03 AM] ~ Rajiv Poddar: I think the topline cost is upwards of $1.5M. Given that ACV, they must have signed up all the F500.

[01/09/23, 8:26:08 AM] ‪+91 99458 85649‬: Isnt the $1Bn projection future looking with a 12 month horizon. In Dec 2022, OpenAI projected $1Bn by end 2024. The projection that came out a few days back is also 12 months in future and pretty much on similar time lines (maybe 1 quarter accelerated). I would assume a lot of this would be enterprise sales projections as thats where lot of action is happening. From what I hear, its a lot around automating conversations (chatbots) and enterprise search still as most enterprises chased that in 2017-18 but couldnt get much out of it then. Enterprises want to see that succeed first.

Also MSFT so soon cloud democratization for OSS Community has further put a pressure which makes me believe openAI will launch SaaS services in name of autonomous-agents/ AGI for biz like CI and fill the remaining gap to reach $1B ‎<This message was edited>

1. generates and moderates content
2. Analyses with CI

10x-ing the API usage bills from the same client.
[01/09/23, 8:48:30 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: I think ChatGPT will be a purely consumer product which will eventually compete with PI , Theyll have enterprise ChatGPT too where it will majorly be a personal assistant as a concept. 

I think they will release gpt 4.5 and all by the end of this year too or maybe early next year. 

If they find more revenue streams, they'll gradually make Ancestral models as OSS
[01/09/23, 8:48:33 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: Thoughts ?

[01/09/23, 8:52:35 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: You can't just sign an enterprise deal in a year, they take a long time & take a lot of money

I remember a dev tool founder in observability heavily funded at seed like some $12-13M tell me that he had spent $250K to get a $170K ARR account 

But since it was a big logo, he still was happy about that

His strategy is to get top 5-10 logos in the space & is expecting that to derive the rest of the deals from other large logos & small
[01/09/23, 8:52:51 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: I think he spent around 9-12 months just nurturing that account
[01/09/23, 8:54:27 AM] Pranjal Mehta Code Hack: Yes true for startups. Not sure if applicable for MSFT or OpenAI
[01/09/23, 8:58:39 AM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: I think regd enterprise sales a lot to learn from Satya's moves than that of Sam's. 

MSFT is pretty much dropping more "applications" on top of openAI, than Meta/ Snapchat/ Tiktok/ GGL ever could. Next I'm excited about FSD X x.ai 
The world of video will change, more than we can imagine in our current reality. ‎<This message was edited>

[01/09/23, 9:38:06 AM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: Nice. So enterprise offerings will be expensive for startups and small-caps. Creating a lot of room for new incumbents at 15-30$/m/u
[01/09/23, 9:41:08 AM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: The other thing that sabotages this is : platform's (AWS/ GCP/ Azure/ Apple/ X's) own LLM offerings. Yet to see anything as predicatable and reliable for biz workflows as chatgpt4.5. 


In terms of time, what does the group think is the catch-up time that mentioned-platforms have to invest before hitting openAI FM accuracy? ‎<This message was edited>

[03/09/23, 8:55:02 AM] ‪+91 99000 64551‬: Hi everyone,
I am Nitin, 40M, IIT-IIM, *struggling entrepreneur* 
I was in Bangalore most of my career, but I have recently moved to *Chandigarh*.
Here is *my entrepreneurship resume*.

I tried starting a company back in 2008 with a friend, but Lehmann brothers crashed and I could not go through it financially at that time. So I quit.
I tried took a career break from 2015-2018, did data consulting which was great. Tried converting into product business with some friends. Failed.
When covid hit, I left job again, tried doing a dance learning startup with a friend. Could not raise funding. I decided to ignore VC funding for all my future initiatives (because there is a lot of pressure post funding) and do only slow-bootstrapping.
Then I did digital marketing agency to learn digital marketing. Closed it few months ago.
Now, I am pivoting into *GenAI/Mobile Games*.

On the other hand, jobs have been great. 
I have worked in *Trilogy, Adobe, Zynga* and few other companies.
I have worked as *developer, PM and data scientist*.

Here are some notable developments and projections from the Report: 
 
📈 Maturing Ecosystem: The Indian fintech ecosystem has transitioned from the early "0-1 phase" to the "1-10 phase" or the "middle journey."

✨ Profitable Ventures: Several fintech unicorns have achieved profitability, demonstrating the sector's potential for sustained financial success. 
 
🚀 Scalable Businesses: The sector is expected to continue witnessing the creation of large companies, more fintech IPOs across various segments (payments, lending, insurance, etc.), and disruption of newer segments by challengers.
 
💸 Capital Momentum: The first half of CY23 has shown signs of recovery with a 33% higher capital momentum compared to H2 CY22. India's differentiated tech infrastructure and operating models are gaining global recognition. 
 
💼 Revenue Projections: Indian fintech revenues are projected to grow at a rate of over 35% annually, aiming to reach over $190 billion by 2030. 

🚨 Key Priorities for Growth: As the Indian fintech landscape navigates funding challenges and prepares for future growth, key priorities include: 

- Fiscal prudence, sustainable profitability, high-quality governance, and resilience. 
- Establishing a clear policy framework to define roles and responsibilities. 
- Fostering private innovation within the emerging DPI 2.0 stack. 
- Leveraging emerging technologies like GenAI & more.

I think active participation from VCs/PEs/ investors in ecosystem development at this stage is very encouraging.

Many times, investors VCs are opaque sitting behind a corporate wall.

In this group, we can see the difference, and hopefully, this is the prime sign of good times ahead for all of us founders....

I call  it ADGPT and I created this in my final year. The variations created by advertisements generated through the use of AdGPT is seen to reduce your CPC by 10-80% (average reduction of 35%) with an accuracy of 95%. I have created an MVP of the same and preparing for a launch. Currently demoing the product with potential customers to get some insights.

My name is Shashwat. An old member of this 9-month old baby-group :P
My old identity was a data-guy working on consumableAI (text2sql). However, now I've pivoted to solevideos - only videos! https://www.linkedin.com/company/solevideos/ 

We are partnering with best of the brands, and helping them take their GTM-msg (upto 9-mins) out creatively with AI-gen marketing videos. Reliably in a time-bound way. And better. Hence slightly costly. Added links to help visualise it. Logo is a waveform -  classical and quantum (I couldn't merge those. Re-learning Arts)

Would love to learn more and connect with AI-artists, indie-devs and folks working in deep-media space. 

Best,
shashwat

[23/09/23, 12:28:17 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Why AI?
[23/09/23, 1:10:52 PM] ‪+91 98201 07378‬: I can respond as a professional investor, or I can respond as myself: somebody who loves to learn and build. The answer is the same in both cases. AI is going to be an important propeller of human progress. 

This has been clear for a long time. Most people driven by intellectual curiosity have been engaging with this technology since before the recent spate of Gen AI breakthroughs brought the wide-reaching consequences of this technology into the popular consciousness. 

In our case, we have been investing in Indian AI companies since the firm was established in 2018. We've funded OSS frameworks and dev tools companies (Jovian in 2018 pre-pivot, Embedchain 2023), research labs (Maya Labs 2020), and vertical product companies (skit.ai 2018, Neodocs 2020, consumr.ai 2022, to name just a few). 

Going forward, we will be investing in the same categories, with further interest in teams taking an AI-forward approach to life sciences and materials sciences. Teams like PopVax in Hyderabad, which are leveraging the vast potential of AlphaFold and genAI to design next gen therapies and vaccines.

I see lots of familiar faces and contacts on this group, many of whom have backgrounds in different fields of the tech ecosystem: fintech, ed-tech, health-tech, and yes even crypto. I know that the same thing that attracted them to those industries has brought them here: a curiosity and will to learn about the important technologies that will permeate and improve the world. I hope that you will not pigeon-hole people based on their previous work because I assume everyone is here for the same reasons: to learn, share, and contribute to the domestic ecosystem

[27/09/23, 6:22:54 PM] Anubhav Mishra AI: Go with ESOPs bro why revenue share
[27/09/23, 6:27:08 PM] ‪+91 99000 64551‬: Depends on a lot of params, but I think 1-5%, if you have a prototype and some business already. 
10% if you only have a PPT

Could be even more, if the role is not founding engineer, but CTO-like.
[27/09/23, 6:28:01 PM] ‪+91 99000 64551‬: Rest, I think some VCs or investors might be able to guide you better with market comps.
[27/09/23, 6:28:37 PM] ‪+91 99000 64551‬: Oops. This is for ESOP, not rev share.
[27/09/23, 6:34:17 PM] Deepanshu Valley AI: What about revenue share number estimates?
[27/09/23, 6:45:18 PM] ‪+91 99000 64551‬: I don't know. But if I had to do something like rev share, I would do quarterly/annual bonus, payout of bonus would be basis revenue milestones (Instead of direct rev share).  And then defining that becomes easy, because you are doing salary+bonus w.r.t to his market comp.
[27/09/23, 6:46:01 PM] ‪+91 99000 64551‬: %rev share for a founding engineer would not be sustainable in long term.
[27/09/23, 6:48:03 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: The engineer is a cost center of the company

Sales & marketing are profit centers since they bring in deals/close them

At an early stage you should never rev share with engineers

Late stage it's quite common if they help you build a new line of business then they get a %. I've seen this example at Toast

If a model is "reading" your WhatsApp messages as part of its training/fine-tuning, would that make customers, especially in the west, uncomfortable ?
I think most of us Indians would not care about privacy that much as long as we see benefit from the assistant ( travel plans, meet up plans, etc)

And in the case of India, WhatsApp bleeds into work( ubiquitous work WhatsApp groups - can you show me the agenda items  agreed on after our last team WhatsApp voice call )

So might have enterprise ramifications too

[02/10/23, 10:13:47 AM] Shikhil Kumar Gupta Ai: How's small company gonna handle below concern?

Officially no faang company will use the open chatpt or generative ai solutions but rather enterprise versions where data governance, compliance  and security concerns are claimed to be taken care by the enterprises and getting more tighter ,they are made legally bound for penalties also in some cases of breach. Problem may be individual engineers who are using open generative ai solutions for their work outside of company network which is very diff to track and may lead to leaking data even accidentally which happened in the ms github case . Companies need to put enough guardrails and do due diligence before adopting generative ai at scale.

I'm diving into data policies, particularly focusing on mid-market and enterprise segments. I'm keen to understand the guidelines around training data, its boundaries, and how data flywheel contribute to product accuracy.

Many startups highlight data as their competitive edge in this AI era, advising to build proprietary LLMs tailored to customer needs/use cases. Yet, the boundaries for data usage are often ambiguous for net new B2B startups. For instance, OpenAI allows users to opt-out of the whole training, but the scope/boundaries of this aren't clear.

I would love to understand if you have resources to share that would clarify these issues or have some learnings to share here.

[20/10/23, 8:52:01 AM] Anuruddh AI: Currently around 2 weeks.
[20/10/23, 8:54:39 AM] Shanoop Krishnan Microsoft Sales: Straightforward option to raise limits on Azure. The process has been streamlined quite a bit with improving capacity, it'll only get better
[20/10/23, 8:55:36 AM] ‪+91 98880 17773‬: Oh amazing. Time to move to azure.

[20/10/23, 9:01:34 AM] ‪+91 90548 13551‬: We have created a 2d game creator using llm for brands to create game content. Let me know if anyone wants to check it out
[20/10/23, 9:06:29 AM] Aryaman (Repello AI): I'm building in AI Security and got to know there are better accelerators/VCs out there like greylock/YLV who have better support and connects in this particular space, so thinking of applying there rather than YC.
[20/10/23, 9:08:41 AM] Aryaman (Repello AI): Do we have any accelerators/VCs in India who have thesis in cybersecurity?
[20/10/23, 9:09:42 AM] Aashay Sachdeva Ai VC Rebright: You might wanna talk with @919108894202 . He is building in the AI security space, and possibly is in top 1% of security folks in India.
[20/10/23, 9:11:02 AM] Aryaman (Repello AI): Yes, already connected to him! His work is really amazing
[20/10/23, 9:12:55 AM] ~ Adarsh: I mean YC has a lot of connects when it comes to the LLM space
[20/10/23, 9:13:38 AM] ‪+91 90548 13551‬: Any marketing leaders in the group? Or anyone who can provide me contact details of brand manager, digital marketing peeps, CMO/vp of marketing, it would be great for us.

[21/10/23, 4:40:07 PM] Shikhil Kumar Gupta Ai: Hello Guys, what is the difference between credits by openAI directly vs Azure OpenAI credits? 

I am looking to apply for credits, I have seen that openAI credits expires in a year though you use it or not? ‎<This message was edited>
[21/10/23, 4:48:21 PM] ‪+91 85609 53375‬: You will be using Azure's OpenAI service in one case and OpenAI's service in the other case.
[21/10/23, 4:50:06 PM] ‪+91 85609 53375‬: I don't know if someone else has experienced it but felt that Azure's OpenAI call for GPT-3.5 is much faster than OpenAI. Though they have some content filtering up which will abruptly block few calls and requires further approval.
[21/10/23, 6:37:25 PM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: I attended GITEX Dubai last week. And exhibited our product.

[21/10/23, 6:47:49 PM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: No sorry. Also it was Arabic
[21/10/23, 6:49:24 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: What’s latency, and did you animate the character?
[21/10/23, 7:06:56 PM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: I wouldn't be the best judge. It was like the animated YT you see. But it was designed as a support bot for energy management application
[21/10/23, 7:09:40 PM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Got it. Still Amazing if it works for real-time interactions considering the language part. I asked as I thought some real-time leap sync model was at play for the animation.
[21/10/23, 9:06:52 PM] Priyank Agrawal: This is a good article for openai vs azure openai wrt latency comparison -  https://medium.com/@jaehoshin62/comparing-azure-openai-and-openai-a-deep-dive-dd18c642e976
[21/10/23, 10:23:11 PM] ‪+91 99990 27633‬: Created this free 3d Android/Windows application back in April that works using Whisper and GPT 3.5 :  https://2600th.itch.io/synthetica
One can create any 3D character (using readyplayerme) and talk to it.
Using something like a thin plate spline motion model/sadtalker would require a lot of compute and also latency would be noticeable.

https://medium.com/point-nine-news/what-does-it-take-to-raise-capital-in-saas-in-2023-56d8f617714
[23/10/23, 8:18:00 AM] ‪+91 98201 07378‬: it’s not a science - it’s basically dictated by the amount of demand there is to fund that particular startup. pedigree of founders (experience, quality) is the most important consideration at that stage
[23/10/23, 8:20:09 AM] ‪+91 98201 07378‬: you also don’t want to dilute too much at that stage - investors will question founder motivation if they only own a small chunk of the startup by the time it’s at a Series A or B stage
[23/10/23, 8:20:59 AM] ‪+91 98201 07378‬: 10-15% dilution is good. TLDR; no formula for valuing pre seed companies, only vibes
[23/10/23, 8:21:08 AM] Jibin Sabu E2E: but its really hard not to dilute <15%  as well. Pre Product, Pre revenue esp in AI involves higher risk as well ‎<This message was edited>

[23/10/23, 5:23:04 PM] ~ Aakash Kambuj: I’d question why you’d want to raise at pre-seed, vs bootstrapping or raising a seed directly once you have a prototype with 2-3 design partners?
[23/10/23, 5:35:03 PM] Anshul Bhide Replit: We had an interesting discussion on this a while back starting up here ^
[23/10/23, 5:37:31 PM] Vignesh Baskaran Hexo Ai: Can you please reshare this for people who recently joined and missed this please!
[23/10/23, 5:37:44 PM] Aryaman (Repello AI): Surely valid for the majority SaaS kind of companies, but in spaces like FinTech, where getting the regulatory license becomes existential for the company, it does make sense to raise a SAFE note and reach the seed stage.
[23/10/23, 5:41:12 PM] ~ Aakash Kambuj: Why not do the regulatory license work after raising the seed? Is it a pre-requisite?

The way I see it, you’re diluting yourself substantially through one more round for no reason.
[23/10/23, 5:42:28 PM] ~ Aakash Kambuj: There’s nothing particularly special about a pre-seed other than a new milestone made up by investors who did not have check sizes that could stand up to increasing seed-stage check sizes from deeper-pocketed investors
[23/10/23, 5:47:17 PM] Aryaman (Repello AI): Agreed
[23/10/23, 5:55:24 PM] ‪+91 98201 07378‬: +1
[23/10/23, 5:56:15 PM] Alok Bishoyi Ai Vc: I see three tiers

GPT for X ($4-20M) Jasper, Harvey etc
Foundational Models ($100M) Mistral Stability
Infra ($10-30M) Modular, Modal 

Series Seed only
[23/10/23, 6:06:31 PM] Alok Bishoyi Ai Vc: if you could raise a "seed" size cheque, w/o needing a "pre-seed" round you could. Venture is a market place. 

Sometimes, however folks need to see more traction for a "seed cheque", which usually costs capital x people to get to. 

Also depending on your specific product as well as GTM, increasingly in my discussion increasing number of folks are going for enterprise from the beginning, instead of the typical midmarket or sme. I believe Siddhartha from Neon had written a better piece on it recently

[24/10/23, 9:56:14 AM] Shikhil Kumar Gupta Ai: Hello folks, Is openAI credits by Microsoft founder hub is for 6 month validity or 1 year validity?

[27/10/23, 6:53:37 PM] ‪+91 75858 93944‬: Hi everyone, I'm Sumit, co-founder of Turbine. First I'll introduce my startup.

Turbine is a data pipeline for LLMs. It lets you create pipelines to sync data from any source to any vector database. Pipelines are fully configurable, and lets you bring your own data source, embedding model, and vector database. We're on a mission to help builders deploy RAG (retrieval augmented generation) apps to production in a scalable and fault-tolerant manner.

Check out Turbine at https://useturbine.com
It's free for early adopters to try at https://console.useturbine.com

As for me, I'm a computer science graduate from IIT Delhi. After working a few years at startups, I've finally decided to take the plunge and build a startup of my own. My LinkedIn is here https://www.linkedin.com/in/summitkg/

I'd love to talk to you people about issues you're facing while building LLM apps, especially if you rely heavily on RAG. Would love to know what kind of issues are you facing getting the retrieval part to work reliably and at scale.
[27/10/23, 8:56:14 PM] ~ Kaushik Bokka: Good stuff Sumit! Internally, we use Prefect flows (self hosted) to run and deploy data ingestion pipelines.
[27/10/23, 8:59:26 PM] ~ Kaushik Bokka: do you think your product’s ICP would build pipelines using UI config rather than programmatically?
[28/10/23, 8:32:44 AM] ‪+91 75858 93944‬: Oh we're using Prefect for Turbine too!
[28/10/23, 8:39:39 AM] ‪+91 75858 93944‬: And yes, that's the essence of it. Although it's not just UI, given it's a devtool there's going to be config file based config as well.

For a single, small data source, which doesn't require a real-time sync, writing pipelines manually is fine. But when the number and size of data sources go up it becomes a whole engineering project in itself to manage the pipeline. We're trying to automate all that and let engineers focus on their business specific problems.
[28/10/23, 8:40:33 AM] ‪+91 75858 93944‬: @917507856760 I'd love to talk to you more about what you're doing and your experience with RAG so far. Can I DM you?

One of my friends is working on AI based startup and he is in very initial phase. He works from his native outside of Karnataka. He is looking to buy virtual address in Bangalore for Company Registration. So he want to understand the reliability of virtual address, compared to physical address. if anybody in the community bought the virtual address for company and GST registration or has knowledge about it. Please DM me.

Aadith Ramesh here, I look at Early Stage SaaS and Enterprise Tech investments at Elevation Capital (https://www.linkedin.com/in/aadith-ramesh/). Looking forward to connecting with Gen AI builders and investors, please reach out if I can be of assistance.
[30/10/23, 11:59:10 AM] Shikhil Kumar Gupta Ai: But is the virtual address reliable? I have seen that ROC can visit anytime at your registered office, if they dont find Books of accounts ...then will charge you with penalty for non compliance of company act.
[30/10/23, 12:00:58 PM] ~ Saurabh Karn: Very unlikely.. there are around 14 lakh registered companies in India. To ensure that address is legit, ROC time to time asks you to submit strange things. For example, stand in front of the office holding the a printout of your company name and CIN and submit with lat lng that kind of things.
[30/10/23, 12:01:03 PM] ~ Saurabh Karn: We work works actually
[30/10/23, 12:01:08 PM] ~ Saurabh Karn: but cheaper options also work

[30/10/23, 12:01:29 PM] Nishant SiteRecon AI: Anyone building harvey.ai for India?
[30/10/23, 12:02:54 PM] ~ Jackie: My strong suggestion. Don't do a virtual address thing. It's kind of illegal from what I last heard and yes I know a few startups who've gotten into problems because of the visits that have happened.
[30/10/23, 12:02:59 PM] ~ Jackie: Better to do a 1 seater office space
[30/10/23, 12:03:14 PM] ~ Jackie: can suggest a few co-working spaces who can help you with this if you want
[30/10/23, 12:03:21 PM] Shikhil Kumar Gupta Ai: I get that, Address would be legit only, But how would you mantain books of account at virtual address, virtual mean you are not present there.

[30/10/23, 1:10:06 PM] Ayush Garg Portkey: Sharing my experience with Wework virtual address(Prestige Atlanta).
Its ok for ROC filing, Wework will help you take photos in one of their meeting rooms putting company logo and all.
But getting GST is a problem, GST officers do not approve of Wework addresses. We had to wait for about 2 months to get it done (with extra fees). And as our CA told me, its getting very hard now to get GST on a Wework address due to shell companies using it a lot.
[30/10/23, 1:11:27 PM] ~ Kshitij Agrawal: myhq provides the same facility. Haven't used it yet.
[30/10/23, 1:14:04 PM] Shikhil Kumar Gupta Ai: Yes getting GST would be problem
[30/10/23, 1:18:01 PM] Shikhil Kumar Gupta Ai: The purpose of talking virtual address in Bangalore, is good branding and trust factor for any investments.
[30/10/23, 1:20:15 PM] ‪+91 99000 64551‬: My two cents on virtual address:

We took virtual address in Bangalore during start of covid.
1) First provider could not provide proper documents we needed for ROC + GST. So, we faced a lot of hassle. Finally, had to find immediate replacement.
2) Second provider was pretty good and smooth experience.
3) I moved to Punjab a year ago. And decided to move the company registration to my permanent address to save virtual address rent. I had to spend a lot of money to move registration between states.

My suggestion to use permanent address instead of virtual address to save rent.
[30/10/23, 1:22:33 PM] ‪+91 99000 64551‬: I doubt investors perceive better brand value if you have a virtual address that they recognize. It just means you are burning a little more money. 

If you take virtual address at some known place, do it for *better things* like maybe events or extra freebies it provides you. Not brand value.

[31/10/23, 1:02:44 PM] ~ Kishore M R: We can apply ourseIves IMHO. Not so complex. StartupIndia seed fund SISF has a central web portal that one can choose an incubator and apply to them. Remember LLP or private ltd not more than 2 yrs of regn  is a base criteria..Grants upto 20L and convertible equity for upto 50 L are given through those incubators. AFAIK only software products are not considered in most govt schemes. Some physical product or part of the product be physical is expected. Not sure of such a restriction with SISF. NASSCOM has an incubator and they may probably help. Based on my experiences with these schemes, if there is a physical product or a part atleast these schemes are useful to collect a lot of grants. If there is a team member exclusively looking into it, then atleast 1-2Crs can be taken as grants. All such schemes are time consuming, not very transparent not to rely it on for any immediate investment or working capital. A sizeable number of people who know how this system works just propose ideas or PoCs  one after another and get the money as their revenue stream and never go to market. The schemes are good but there are loopholes and challenges for someone who is betting against time. ‎<This message was edited>

[09/11/23, 10:40:29 AM] ~ Rohan Athawade: Hey everyone! Has anyone here applied for SISFS? What was your experience?
[09/11/23, 10:46:57 AM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: This is so early '23. Where's Imbue?
[09/11/23, 10:47:50 AM] Anubhav Mishra AI: Inflection too
[09/11/23, 10:49:37 AM] Hari Sir: It depends on which Institution you are going through. The scheme is well defined and has strict SLAs. You can get 25 lakhs to 100 lakhs as convertible or debt . Grant is also possible upto 20 lakhs in some cases
[09/11/23, 10:50:21 AM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: Imbue looks interesting. Founder has a eccentric burning man wibe and (one of) her moat is that she shared flat with main guy in openai who trained gpt3
[09/11/23, 10:51:32 AM] Dhruv Anand: Moat lol
[09/11/23, 10:51:39 AM] Hari Sir: I am in the investment committee of three institutions who have received funds for investment in startups. Can say for sure that it is a good scheme for the eco system and many have benefited from the scheme .
[09/11/23, 10:53:26 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: I'm not sure what they mean by bringing reasoning to LLMs. Are they planning KGs or are just FOMO investors finding anything that looks shiny?
[09/11/23, 10:55:08 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: I'll bite but what is SISFS and what are the qualification criterias for grants? ‎<This message was edited>
[09/11/23, 10:55:37 AM] ~ Kishore M R: Startup India Seed Fund
[09/11/23, 10:57:03 AM] ~ Kishore M R: Basically GoI invests in startups through institutions mostly engineering colleges and incubators.
[09/11/23, 10:57:05 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: My experience working with government agencies and funds has been terrible. If you don't have contacts, doesn't matter what impact you bring, you get used as a free consultant, and then someone insider gets it.
[09/11/23, 10:57:26 AM] ~ Kishore M R: And they decide whether you get a grant or they take a share ‎<This message was edited>
[09/11/23, 10:57:42 AM] ~ Kishore M R: I mean the  committe formed by the institution
[09/11/23, 10:59:24 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: I worked for many months with the Agri Ministry where they wanted to sign an MoU and help us with the distribution, we bring knowledge and dataset, then after all consultation decided to go the other way.
[09/11/23, 11:00:15 AM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: No i think they are more rigorous than that. Check https://imbue.com/company/launch/
[09/11/23, 11:00:19 AM] ~ Kishore M R: Bang on! There are exceptions. IMHO dealing with them for quite sometime, if there is someone in the team who can build all relations patiently, then one could get the funds. Never depend on them for planned investments or working capital. Money could come anytime or not. Feel a jackpot when it lands
[09/11/23, 11:01:41 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: I'm too straightforward for Babu paddling.
[09/11/23, 11:02:11 AM] ~ Kishore M R: MoU is the most abused word in the govt sector.
[09/11/23, 11:02:18 AM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: Same. Worked with Maharashtra Cybercrime dept. Squeezed us dry. The only gain was learning some interesting / shady stuff which makes up for good stories.
[09/11/23, 11:02:56 AM] ~ Kishore M R: 🙌🏼😁
[09/11/23, 11:04:18 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: I felt that there are so many people whose livelihood depends upon being middlemen.
[09/11/23, 11:05:20 AM] Ankur Pandey Longshot: @917062126119 @919945194380
[09/11/23, 11:06:18 AM] ~ Kishore M R: Especially the sector like agri, the distribution govt has is massive even if they address a small %. And central depts have no strong hold on state subjects like agri. State govts are far worse to work with.
[09/11/23, 11:08:19 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: The thing is that their current efforts are for photo ops. 2-3 months and things will fall apart as usual.
[09/11/23, 11:08:48 AM] ~ Kishore M R: Middlemen are villianised easily. They are unfair. But with a country with so many small farmers with no marketing power, they run the show literally. And anyone who says we will remove middlemen is the new middleman.
[09/11/23, 11:09:10 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Anyway, I'm going to make all of them redundant or die trying.
[09/11/23, 11:10:09 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: I'm talking about the Middleman, the broker between gov and startups for those funds and projects.
[09/11/23, 11:11:31 AM] ~ Kishore M R: I have stopped dealing with them. Zen! They are the shadow world babus.
[09/11/23, 11:13:20 AM] Aryaman (Repello AI): https://twitter.com/Davidjpark96/status/1722467963456864379?t=NtvkAv9GFYwc6iGgLKjHwA&s=08

:)
[09/11/23, 11:16:11 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Very true. I've been asked by an investor about Custom Model training from OpenAI, my answer was that they helped me by setting up the price point, now I know what to charge the customers.
[09/11/23, 11:16:53 AM] Aryaman (Repello AI): Exactly!
[09/11/23, 11:17:59 AM] Hari Sir: I do not know any one in the government- but many of my portfolio companies have got grants / funding from various government agencies . They did not pay anyone nor did they have any relatives in the committee or team . Yes - it does take time to complete the process , but the newer schemes have set SLAs.and track it well .
[09/11/23, 11:22:12 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: You’re right as I don’t have enough experience to generalize, however the field is moving fast and as a startup, time is very precious these days. This may work for traditional startups, but a GenAI startup betting on Gov funds with their timeline, one can end up losing edge in that waiting period.
[09/11/23, 11:23:21 AM] Hari Sir: Do not over estimate Angels/ VCs and PEs for quick turnaround. There are only a few exceptions.
[09/11/23, 11:24:26 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Unfortunately, that is true too.
[09/11/23, 11:26:27 AM] Hari Sir: I would only say that the startup eco system now has several government schemes to back them - they were non existent a few years ago . ‎<This message was edited>
[09/11/23, 11:28:33 AM] Hari Sir: Uniphore , Dehaat , Phool , Noccarc and many such companies have benefited from government schemes at some point of time in their startup journey .
[09/11/23, 11:29:30 AM] Hari Sir: If you look at the Biotech space , most startups look up to BIRAC since no angels typicall invest in the sector .
[09/11/23, 11:30:19 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: All of these startups have longer product cycle and slow moving tech.
[09/11/23, 11:31:01 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: GenAI, which we focus in this group, I would say is totally unprecedented.
[09/11/23, 11:31:12 AM] ‪+91 98100 58207‬: This is a gem 💎

[09/11/23, 3:21:37 PM] Deepak Ai: Hey Guys! How to go about collecting international payments, do I need an Import Export Code/License?What pg has low friction for this?
[09/11/23, 3:29:45 PM] ‪+91 77339 74342‬: Stripe. Best.
[09/11/23, 4:13:14 PM] Dhruv Anand: I've been using Salt for a US client these past few months. It works great, and allows them to do a domestic bank transfer

[12/11/23, 6:42:48 AM] Sahir AI: I use paddle.
[12/11/23, 7:46:20 AM] Shanoop Krishnan Microsoft Sales: Xflow, could help. Stripe is an investor. https://www.xflowpay.com/
[12/11/23, 7:57:11 AM] Deepak Ai: Paddle and Xflow are exactly what I was looking for. Thank you everyone
[12/11/23, 8:15:14 AM] Priyank Agrawal: Another good paddle equivalent is Lemonsqueezy. LS is better if you want to more stuff with payment APIs etc and don't want to handle taxation etc.
[12/11/23, 8:42:42 AM] Prashanth YV AI: Xflow is awesome. Let me know in case anyone wants an intro.
[12/11/23, 10:20:09 AM] Sahir AI: paddle took 1-2 weeks to get my domain verified and setup. what's the duration for xflow/stripe ?

[18/11/23, 6:35:14 AM] Nitin Mahajan 88 Vc: True but doesn’t these type of concerns happen all the time? People can’t agree on feature prioritisation forget right balance of risk, safety, compliance levels in a non regulated company. 

So, maybe those were excuses for a bigger agenda board has. Microsoft was of course not aware? 🥸

[18/11/23, 6:36:07 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Microsoft was not aware, Satya Nadella has already come out with a statement

[23/11/23, 6:34:03 PM] Priyank Agrawal: Yeah, his question was about not yet registered company
[23/11/23, 6:34:42 PM] ~ Aniket: yeah, but ill check regardless if they have something else, some smaller grant or something ‎<This message was edited>
[23/11/23, 6:35:10 PM] ‪+65 8256 0957‬: Yes they might have another program.
[23/11/23, 6:35:18 PM] ~ Rohan Athawade: You could also try out AWS Activate for Startups. You'd get $1k in credits initially, and later would be eligible for up to $100k. (Although I think this also requires your company to be registered)
[23/11/23, 6:35:41 PM] ‪+91 99000 64551‬: AFAIK, they will need to register a company OR be in some incubator/accelerator somehow which grants credits. (Not sure if that also requires registered company).
[23/11/23, 6:36:12 PM] ~ Adarsh: There's this program by gradcapital

[23/11/23, 6:37:15 PM] ~ Adarsh: Yeah it's only for students
[23/11/23, 6:37:33 PM] ‪+91 99000 64551‬: Most companies don't have bandwidth to scrutinize their grants to pre-product startups. So, they find it convenient to do it via programs of incubators/accelerators.
[23/11/23, 6:37:48 PM] ‪+65 8256 0957‬: Registering a company is not that expensive. You might do that as well and not miss being part of founders hub.
[23/11/23, 6:38:08 PM] ~ Aniket: yep makes sense, they are on it
[23/11/23, 6:38:27 PM] Enkrypt.ai Prashant AI: Depends on how compute intensive the needs are. We built an MVP with the $200 trial from Google cloud and sufficed to run a few demos as well for a couple of months. We weren't an AI product but encrypted models and didnt need GPUs to a certain extent for the MVP.

[24/11/23, 2:40:18 PM] ~ Bharath: They may try registering an LLP to begin with, if these programs accept that. It is far cheaper to do than incorporate a Private Limited Co (PLC) and has lesser disclosures to make
[24/11/23, 2:42:03 PM] ~ Bharath: I had a sub 20k quote for an LLP a few weeks back (when I inquired) while the PLC was more like a lakh for Authorized Capital of 10L

Authorised capital also does not indicate true cost of setting up, happy to help out if anyone needs advice here.
My partner and I are lawyers, and we've set up a partnership, an LLP and a private company so far. Will be happy to assist with some advice
[24/11/23, 2:45:07 PM] ‪+91 91 0 87750 13‬: You just need a decent CA to assist with filing and financial liabilities, that's it
[24/11/23, 2:54:53 PM] ~ Bharath: Thanks, Raunak!
[24/11/23, 2:55:41 PM] ~ Bharath: Just out of curiosity, is it just Stamp Duty on Auth Capital that makes AC a factor? ‎<This message was edited>
[24/11/23, 2:57:42 PM] ‪+91 91 0 87750 13‬: Authorised share capital simply allows you to have a certain number of shares that add up to the total authorised share value

For example, almost all companies start of with a share value of ₹10. Our company has an Authorised share value of ₹50lakhs. At ₹10/share, we have 5 lakh shares available in the company pool.
[24/11/23, 2:58:12 PM] ‪+91 91 0 87750 13‬: Costs come to you only when you need to transfer the shares from the company pool to the founders/employees/investors
[24/11/23, 2:58:45 PM] ‪+91 91 0 87750 13‬: It's a bit of a rabbit hole to dive into haha, I don't think I'm doing the best job of explaining it here
[24/11/23, 2:59:31 PM] ‪+91 99458 85649‬: Setting a PLC is about Rs 20-30k for authorized capital upto 10lacs.
[24/11/23, 3:00:15 PM] ‪+91 91 0 87750 13‬: With a competent CA, yes. About that much
[24/11/23, 3:01:14 PM] ‪+91 91 0 87750 13‬: But definitely don't go for the option of PLC if it's a matter of getting a grant. An LLP is the preferred option.
[24/11/23, 3:02:20 PM] ‪+91 99458 85649‬: Ya agree LLP is better option. A lot of incubators, etc, though insist on PLC. We also setup a PLC recently for that reason only.
[24/11/23, 3:03:33 PM] ‪+91 91 0 87750 13‬: Yes, they do that primarily because they need to acquire ownership of shares against their investment. LLP's are very rigid that way
[24/11/23, 3:04:44 PM] ‪+91 91 0 87750 13‬: You want them to gain value from your company, not ownership. So it's definitely the preferred entity for you as well if you are dealing with incubators or accelerator programmes

My co-founder @32486634341 and I are in the bay area for the next 3 weeks. 

We're looking to connect with folks building in the LLM space who can help us navigate the local landscape.
[24/11/23, 11:12:08 PM] ‪+91 99017 04680‬: We're going through a pivot currently. While building on image generation use cases for marketing, we built some internal tools leveraging LLMs that helped our developers reduce over 70% of time spent in reading through code repos and API documentation. 

In the process, we've built RAG systems that leverage knowledge graphs. We're currently exploring a couple of hypothesis around this. 

Do DM if you're in the bay area and can help us navigate.

Cheers! ‎<This message was edited>

Supported.
[07/12/23, 2:01:58 PM] Gokul Ramakrishnan Neu Alumni: It is a bit tricky but you probably have to rely on a combination of machine translated data from English to these languages, source data from news outlets and also upsample this data further.

[07/12/23, 2:10:32 PM] ‪+91 85609 53375‬: We were trying to use translated book content 3-4 years back to train a transformer model. Like taking Harry Potter Book1 in and Marathi. And mapping that on page/context/para basis. At that time it didn't work well because our training needed exact sentence mapping. But if you can take larger context, para based training can be tried out to generate trainingdata.

[08/12/23, 7:07:27 AM] Keshav CRO E2E: A recent event had a talk on AI and Cloud policies around the world. The discussion included important new developments in the European Union, the US, and India, as well as the bigger picture of global data control and some new policies that will affect it. Quick Notes


1. India’s Stance on AI & Cloud:
    1. Evolution of Digital India Act: The Digital India Act is evolving over the IT Act of 2000, the same is in its drafting stage, signaling a shift in India's approach to regulating AI. 
    2. Guidelines over Strict Implementation: India is likely to adopt guidelines rather than strict implementation for AI development. This approach aligns with the need for flexibility in adapting to evolving regulatory frameworks.
    3. Cloud Regulation Challenges: Challenges in cloud regulation, particularly the lack of clear distinctions between Infrastructure as a Service (IAAS), Platform as a Service (PAAS), and Software as a Service (SAAS), highlight potential hurdles for our cloud-based services in the Indian market.Singapore is soon to release a policy segregating each service, it will be crucial to track the same.
    4. TRAI's Control Attempt: The Telecom Regulatory Authority of India (TRAI) proposed consolidating control over cloud and telecom policies under a single regulatory body, suggesting the integration of cloud policies under the Department of Telecommunications (DoT). However, this proposal was rejected, and the response indicated that the regulation of cloud services would remain under the purview of the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology (MeitY).
    5. Meity Secretary: The MeitY Secretary is closely overseeing the forthcoming policies, with a specific focus on those being introduced by Asian countries. This is noteworthy as our Digital India Act is anticipated to encompass a combination of these policies.


2. US Executive Order on AI:
    1. Transparency and Safety: The U.S. is moving towards increased transparency from AI companies, reflecting a global trend. Developers are encouraged to share safety test results to assess the risks associated with their technology, highlighting the importance of responsible AI development.
    2. Adaptive Policy: The policy remains adaptive and flexible, indicating that the regulatory landscape is still evolving.

3. EU AI Policy:
    1. Final Chapter Pending: The EU AI policy is in its final stages, with a proposed motion expected at the end of this week. 
    2. Resistance from Key EU Members: France, Italy, and Germany, the initial contributors to the policy's formulation, are currently opposing certain elements of the policy. They are championing self-regulation in order to safeguard and foster their AI entities like Mistral Ai and Aleph Alpha, while also aiming to prevent potential dominance by U.S. entities in the AI ecosystem.
    3. Focus on Human Rights: The policy places a strong emphasis on human rights considerations, aligning with the growing global awareness of ethical AI practices. 
    4. GDPR Update: An update to the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) of 2018 is anticipated, emphasising limited retention periods for personal data. This aligns with the broader trend of heightened data protection measures globally.
    5. Liability and Accountability Frameworks: AI policies likely to emphasize the importance of human oversight and control, especially in critical applications. Users may be granted the right to comprehend when AI-driven decisions are made and possess the ability to intervene or appeal such decisions. Additionally, developers will typically be mandated to establish transparent liability and accountability frameworks, delineating responsibilities and potential repercussions in the event of system failures or adverse consequences. These measures aim to ensure ethical AI practices, user empowerment, and accountability throughout the development and deployment lifecycle.


4. Suggestion over Glocalizing Data for AI:

1. Free Migration of Data: The proposition advocating for the unrestricted movement of data across borders signals a significant paradigm shift in data governance. This perspective acknowledges the increasing significance of seamless data flow in global AI strategies. 
2. Enforcement and Policing: A debate on policing of data was carried with a conclusion that the counsel to enforce and police data should be done selectively and only when necessary furthering a pragmatic and nuanced approach to data governance. Rather than imposing rigid regulations universally, this recommendation suggests tailoring enforcement measures based on specific contextual needs. This approach strikes a balance between ensuring data security and facilitating innovation in the AI landscape. It allows for flexibility in adapting to diverse regulatory environments while addressing concerns related to privacy, security, and ethical use of data.
3. Geofencing of Data: The discussion pertained that geofencing of data adds an additional layer of consideration. Geofencing involves establishing virtual perimeters around geographical areas, regulating data based on location. Incorporating geofencing aligns with the idea of selective enforcement, where data governance measures can be tailored according to specific geographic regions in order to comply with specific domestic privacy laws within a state or country.

5. NIST Framework on AI & Cloud: It was suggested to monitor the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) framework for AI & cloud-based policy, given its scientific approach to policy drafting. Similar elements have been incorporated in the executive order on AI by the U.S. and the same is referred to for any amendments.

I am Ruchir, co-founder of SydeLabs (www.sydelabs.ai).
We have just launched our first product SydeBox. SydeBox is the first of multiple modules of the SydeLabs platform that gives you a full suite of tools for AI Risk management.
SydeBox enables you to perform automated Red Teaming of LLMs and LLM based applications. It is super easy to use and so far has been able to consistently break into most SoTA models that we have run it against. Before we do a full launch would love for some early adopters to give it a try and give us feedback.
Please DM me if you would like early access, and all we would like in return is to get some feedback from you.

Best,
Ruchir

They have just decided to implement this, but haven’t figured what all specifics they would implement. So it’s a journey for them. Getting the committee to draft regulations etc.


We shouldn’t have to worry about this now itself afaik ‎<This message was edited>
[15/12/23, 1:20:52 PM] Arko C | xylem.ai: What is their selection criteria honestly?

When you open all the startups backed by YC and add the India filter, you’ll see 95%+ with some Tier-1 college or MAANG/BIG4 work exp. the rest 5% must have some crazy traction when they got in.

Most AI-bets don’t even make sense (if you’re looking at it from a $100M ARR pov).

But then, brand matters a lot and value is beyond that. Your earliest customers are from YC, investors will give you term sheets for sure. You have lower chances of failure as your rope to experiment is longer.

If you get it, take it. Value is 100%, criteria n all is up for debate. ‎<This message was edited>

[17/12/23, 2:07:07 PM] Shashwatv1 Consumableai: Dear esteemed community, 
We recently launched Interviewjarvis on Producthunt. 
InterviewJARVIS is an AI-tool tailored for job-seekers in tech. We are using genAI to align candidate responses with job description of the target company. Additionally we provide, users to deep-dive into any question, making them absolutely sure about a question-type. 

Most interview prep sites offer generalised interview preparation material, which does not help in advance rounds such as culture-fit and salary-negotiation rounds and that's where most candidates (incl. myself) need help.  

If you can upvote us on Producthunt, that will go a long way. I am sure you will find it helpful in your interview prep, be it MAANG, YC, or PhD.
Refraining from sharing link here. You can find it in Deep Media group or search on producthunt.

[09/03/24, 6:36:26 AM] Lalit Vijay: We have tried to work out with some leading academia, academic institutions are looking at these opportunities as just side projects with little attention. The primary objective is making some money for individuals + unrealistic gain sharing in case of +ve outcome with little emphasis on how   research work can be aligned with industry. ‎<This message was edited>

[14/03/24, 7:28:45 AM] Enkrypt.ai Prashant AI: In my opinion for the rows: AI maturity and model selection will depend on whether the startup is deeptech, b2b and b2c. It might be their model that is the moat at the beginning stages for a deeptech company.
[19/12/23, 3:58:52 PM] ~ Ayush Yadav | SuperHeroAI: I got it activated in 1 day, it's just a form fill it

[14/03/24, 7:31:00 AM] Prayank Swaroop Accel Atom Ai: From India typically hard for companies to raise a lot of capital to pre-train models. So I think better to establish that customers are willing to pay for what you want to sell, then once you raise more capital get to custom pre-train models.
[19/12/23, 4:00:04 PM] Dilip Thomas Ittyera AI: And they bump it up on usage. And if you are part of any incubator or accelerator you can get to a higher slab to start with
[14/03/24, 7:34:05 AM] Aditya Agrawal: @19377081307 : Has find-tuned model at very less cost and is known to be top agri LLM. But I agree that imp to establish need and then take heavy costing. ‎<This message was edited>

[14/03/24, 8:03:58 AM] Enkrypt.ai Prashant AI: Exactly. Finding customer need is above all. For a deeptech startup - in our case, our clients want better than open-source solutions. Exactly to your point, we had very different conversations and focus areas when we were working on sabu.ai and now when we are building enkryptai - common is focusing on customer needs.
[19/12/23, 4:02:10 PM] ~ Ayush Yadav | SuperHeroAI: makes sense now, 100,000$
[14/03/24, 8:49:49 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: A lot of cost is also associated with the data curation task. While the pre-training cost for customer-specific or vertical models will keep getting lower compared to SoTA models, the curation can be more than 50%* of the total cost

@919899951010 thoughts? 

Can structure the discussion as well - for example, we’ve been trying to deeply understand this persona of “AI Engineer”, and would be great to brainstorm on how others are seeing it, exchange notes.

For higher quality discussions, can also limit the domain to any of B2B/B2C/Dev-centric/Marketer-centric etc as well.

[25/12/23, 8:17:16 AM] Deepak Ai: Have spent some time exploring this space. My take: call centres will consolidate further, small call centres will be disrupted by large ones. Large call centres won't be disrupted by tech companies. Thought process: 1) Call centres already have distribution, they'll be able to build tech(which is very much democratized rn) sooner than tech companies build distribution 2) Mostly processes are outsourced, not just calls. And to complete the process you'll always need humans to fill up for edge cases and escalation, which these call centres already have.
Overall: good small space if you're building tech for call centres, not a viable space if you want to replace call centres. 
Observing this space, let's see how this goes.
[24/03/24, 5:36:29 AM] Anshul Bhide Replit: cray
[25/12/23, 8:23:01 AM] ~ Kshitij Agrawal: Is it a small space though? As call center automation increases it could start creating new categories.. 
From outbound lead qualification to completing the sales funnel. Think about it, it could take up the market of sales coaching (Gong) and many other adjacencies as well.

[25/12/23, 8:30:07 AM] Deepak Ai: Despite the perception, I think sales, positioning and marketing has been the differentiator for most companies. Saw somewhere even publicly listed saas companies spend 50-60% on s&m, with tech becoming more and more standard, I feel sales and positioning as differentiator is going to grow stronger. Many parts will be automated no doubt, but with automations that'll become new standard and people will build on top of it to differentiate. So don't see end to end sales automation at all. Could be horrendously wrong 😂

One more thought, in this scenario there is space for 100s of small product / service providers who can sell to customer owners (call centers in this case). 

It’s a different outcome than last 10 years where tech was a moat and so tech companies earned huge multiples and acquired any emerging tech to build customer relationships. How the pendulum can be a little balanced?

Very insightful conversation.

TL/DR :
- some insights into Elon's leadership style & focus on small, technical teams
- Maybe the GPU has outlived it's usefulness.Maybe room for new hardware architectures which are designed for distributed training at massive scale and more fault tolerant 
- Fundamental algorithm Innovation : Andrej says there is 1000 to million X factor for improvement to make models more energy efficient (reference to the human brain)
- Succeasor to the transformer architecture and innovation in the ml architectures

[29/03/24, 10:29:48 AM] Pratik Ai: Hii harsh…
Yes sure …

I am thinking in 2 ways
1. Really foundational stuff which means no one (or atleast me) knows how that can be done

Ex - how to make small models that are good with reasoning, how to solve reinforcement learning in language model(RLHF is very very basic thing)

2. Reachable stuff but still not so much that you can start building right away

Ex - how do you make a good Ai tutor, how do you solve memory in long conversations, ai + mental health 


The basic point is to move away from ideas like… image generation with prompts, product photography etc

Mostly thinking on what can be worked on for 10+ years

I need 1 help.

*Problem*
My team is trying to get our very basic mobile app live in the apple app store but it is getting rejected saying that payment option should be only as an in-app purchase.

*Proposed Solution*
As adding an in-app purchase is difficult, we were thinking to live the app at app store without any purchase option and ask user to buy subscription only through the website.

*Main Question*

Its extremely sad to see Coqui shutting down. They definitely have one of the best tech I the world. In fact they built SOTAs over and over again. I know a very similar company started along the same time around 2021. They just sell customized TTS APIs to Businesses. Most of us wouldn't even have heard of the name of the company. I heard from their investor that they are making few million ARR. This is hard to comprehend! ‎<This message was edited>

[03/01/24, 5:08:26 PM] Priyank Agrawal: Very sad honestly. Surely they could have done decently well with a hosted api service (I was a subscriber and they shut it down 2-3 months ago). It's pretty obvious OAI launching at 1/10th the price of their hosted api effected that strategy. But they recently pivoted to do 365 usd commerical license for just the model (no GPU cost for them). Idk why they dint continue that it would have been decent I think.
[06/04/24, 1:30:16 PM] Aditya Agrawal: we have started the space.
[03/01/24, 5:39:07 PM] Nitin Mahajan 88 Vc: Very much curious to know what happened here. They had a huge head start in what’s arguable a tech play.

- was it OpenAI’s cheaper pricing 
- ⁠did they see a training data assymetry coming up that made them feel big tech such as meta and Msft have a better chance of winning 
- ⁠did the team by any chance disintegrated from an outside poaching?

Coqui was very good. Sad.

[03/01/24, 6:16:33 PM] Nitin Mahajan 88 Vc: Then you should be selling and not shutting down? Surprised no one wanted to pick them up.

They raised 3.3m in March 23’. So, not a lot. Likely they ran out of money and didn’t get KPIs for series A closure?

If true, then markets are brutal that such a good tech player, established brand, and distribution also couldn’t reach required ARR expectations for a series A

(Pure speculation but quite curious as this is a big surprised shut down)

TIL perplexity started as a Bing and open ai API wrapper !

[03/01/24, 10:10:52 PM] Varshul Ai Dubverse: Coqui was really great.

Have been in TTS space since 3 years so can say for sure it was not cheaper pricing as the offering was entirely different + OS was their DNA. The market is just beginning to heat up esp with 11 labs so it's hard to say it was revenue/monetization unless they ran out of money. 

Their PLG motion was def weak vs so many TTS players just acting as a wrapper over GCP/Azure voices and doing decent for a SaaS.

And selling a company in this market is hard and more tricky when your models are OS.

My guess is either they ran out or something internal.

[08/04/24, 8:26:20 AM] ~ ashish: some notes :

- another TIL: perplexity’s initial idea was text2sql
		- they iterated and quickly realized it was not a great idea

- was a small window into how aravind thinks !
“you will always have competition and moats - dont be obsessed with it
focus on fast execution and being the best at what you do, make it better than anyone else”

- and 2 bruce lee quotes on focus :-
1. “the successful warrior is the average man with laser like focus”
2. ⁠”I dont fear the man who has practiced 10000 kicks one, i fear the man who has practiced 1 kick, 10000 times”

- founders have high experimentation energy (including him),
but say no to things ! 
(credits perplexity’s cofounder johnny ho, competitive programmer for this)
- (steve jobs quote : i am as proud of the things i said no to, as i am of the things i chose to do)

- and an implied book reco - amp it up by frank slootman(snowflake)
at the beginning of your startup journey - dont worry too much about strategy, 
build something, iterate, try to get customer traction, find your “truth vector”

- “build execution muscle first, dont try to be a great strategist right away”

- “your only deserve the right to strategize , once you have earned the track record of execution”

=====

“No strategy is better than its execution. Organizations can go very, very far with world class execution. However they will go nowhere without it, no matter how brilliant the strategy is. Execution needs to come first.” ‎<This message was edited>

[18/04/24, 7:42:30 AM] Priyank Agrawal: What he means is VC investment in SaaS returning 1000x are dead.

Especially the super expensive AOV enterprise saas.

Low AOV SaaS will never die, revenues will go down with competition but the expectation that everyone will build their own SaaS tools is bonkers, they are not considering the cost of failures, cost of testing and cost "guarantee" that it works.

Phone call is dead?
Last year was the highest number of phone calls we handled.More than 2 billion. SO neither saas is dead nor the phone call. Yet :)
But yeah, huge VC returns on SaaS and 35X-50X valuations are dead.

I’ve used firstbase services, but found out that they were ignoring FEMA compliance fineprint that renders the incorporation unusable.

I don’t know if they have fixed this eventually. Many other “express incorporation” services had the same issue for Indian founders.

After significant searching, I also found that this was a common issue with many US incorporations by Indian founders, done via “express”services, which only show up when you raise an institutional round.

Many of them eventually went with Inventus which I believe most YC companies (with Indian founders) use now.

Please research the Indian side of the compliance thoroughly before using these services because you’ll have endless headaches with null paperwork and fillings even if you don’t have traction with your company itself. ‎<This message was edited>

[25/04/24, 1:44:27 PM] ~ Vamshi: For reference, I used their Delaware C setup
[29/01/24, 7:25:55 PM] Aditya Agrawal: Accept it
[25/04/24, 1:46:29 PM] ~ Vamshi: The downside of course is that Inventus fees are way more expensive and will only be worth it if you are close to raising funds or some other event which absolutely requires incorporation.
[29/01/24, 7:26:13 PM] Aditya Agrawal: So basically my free credit got wasted
[25/04/24, 1:53:29 PM] ~ Harsh Gupta: Also firstbase and doola both are for setting an LLC, if you plan to raise money at some point, you need to have a C-Corp.
[29/01/24, 7:26:23 PM] Aditya Agrawal: But I got a feel that product is valuable

[29/01/24, 7:26:57 PM] Sai Sharan Tangeda Hyderabad Ai: Got it 👍
[25/04/24, 1:56:24 PM] ~ Vamshi: Firstbase used to have a Delaware C, that’s what I used. Not sure if they still offer it, but i won’t recommend it at this point even if they had it.

I got complete silence from their support team when the FEMA compliance issue was raised.

Like zero response or evasive answers.

[30/01/24, 9:12:03 AM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Next week, specifically for practitioners
[25/04/24, 1:58:14 PM] ~ Vamshi: There used to be a way until a year or so ago, when it was possible to issue shares from the U.S. entity to the India founders directly, while still being compliant.
[30/01/24, 9:46:44 AM] Dr. Pratik Desai Ai: Save some tips for 7th 😜
[25/04/24, 1:59:08 PM] ~ Vamshi: There was a change to FEMA regulations around that time which made that approach non compliant (I think gifted shares or some equivalent).
[30/01/24, 3:19:06 PM] Paras Pathora: ‎You added Paras Pathora
[25/04/24, 2:00:53 PM] ~ Vamshi: Now you have to use an indirect approach by setting up an LP here that invests into the U.S. entity, something like that.

I didn’t go down that route, but it’s the “proper” structure that law firms like Inventus will set you up with.

Perhaps someone else here can share. I think there are several YC companies in this group that probably did it.

Do recheck everything i said as there may be new services that combine the cost effectiveness with a really compliant solution. 

If cost is no issue and you have real investors lined up, and yet for some reason the incorporation is your responsibility, then do check with Inventus

OAI launched a decent TTS not as good as Elevenlabs surely.

[09/02/24, 12:12:04 PM] Varshul Ai Dubverse: Costs will go down as more “serious” competition comes up. Currently commercially available players can be divided into 3 category:
1. Big Tech: TTS being just one of the thousand things they do so not going to be the best anytime soon. OpenAI, GCP, Azure all fall here. 
2. ⁠TTS Startups: Coqui(now shut down), Play.HT, Wellsaid, Respeecher, couple of other YC startups come here. This works well for certain use-cases like conversation or audiobooks but no one model rule all.
3. ⁠Elevenlabs: No one beats them in terms of quality, they are just soo superior. Available in 28 languages, offers voice cloning off the bat. Now playing massively on capital-as-moat.

GPT 4 Private Preview Program:
Selection criteria:
Readiness -- have you fine tuned before? do you have a dataset and a use case ready to go?
Use case -- we need to screen use cases for compliance with the Azure OAI Code of Conduct
Acknowledge that it's a preview -- APIs may change, models may need to be retrained, SLAs may be minimal (this is all scoped in our onboarding doc actually -- Azure OpenAI GPT-4 Private Preview Onboarding Guide.docx)

Program structure:
Early gated access to GPT-4 fine tuning as a service --> new model in the existing fine tuning service (available in AOAI Studio, AI Studio, APIs etc) 
Up to 50 customers
Likely apply through a form and we'll triage

Onboarding & Experience:
We manually allow list subscription IDs
Engineering would hold onboarding sessions with selected teams to go through the preview experience
Likely start onboarding folks in the first week of March?
We'll provide an alias for folks to reach out with questions
Expect participants to give us feedback - what do they think of the experience, how is GPT4 relative to the other models, what works / what doesn't et

I'm wondering if it supports audio analysis via API calls in Python.

Too much competition on core offerings - 11labs, assembly , decent strategy to go for a different moat
[18/05/24, 3:37:54 PM] Priyank Agrawal: I think this is just an seo play, they have been working very hard on seo, they have a ton on AI content literally ai glossary pages etc

How does it help them monetarily tho ? Or does it increase the ways they a/b test monetisation ?
[18/05/24, 3:44:51 PM] ~ Pratiksha | Graphia.AI: So there are many such tool directories out there. Literally 1000s of them.

[18/05/24, 4:04:00 PM] ~ Pratiksha | Graphia.AI: every person who's building an ai tool thinks of listing their app in one or more of these directories as it gives them traffic and sometimes leads
[18/05/24, 4:05:21 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: You’ll only get nsfw users at best from these directories
[18/05/24, 4:05:45 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Leads are far fetched

[18/05/24, 4:07:48 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Yeah, don’t fall for their claims. The west has mastered the art of selling anything
[18/05/24, 4:21:10 PM] ~ Pratiksha | Graphia.AI: Not east/west/north/south problem. A lot Asians also have these directories. It's about how well they sell themselves
[18/05/24, 4:35:02 PM] Priyank Agrawal: actually, you get a bunch of fellow founders as well
i got listed in one such email newsletter (they asked to pay i dint, then after 20 days they posted automatically, maybe lack of ads/content) — 
mostly got founders who are exploring what to build next
[18/05/24, 4:37:19 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: Newsletters are different
[18/05/24, 4:39:08 PM] Anshuman Pandey Ai Startups Group: You’ll start looking up directories then you’ll start looking up newsletters then you’ll realize it’s creators & their faces this whole time - you’ll start finding them on marketplaces like Passionfroot 

A couple of months later you’ll go back to finding results in just directly talking to customers 

Unless you’re building B2C, I don’t recommend marketing until $100K in ARR

[19/05/24, 9:54:55 AM] Divya Tak Ai: Designer here. Colors are very much a cultural thing, so what works for a certain group of folks and gives them a sense of calm and peace might not work for other cultures. Any "information" that says otherwise is a half truth, if not a blatant lie.
