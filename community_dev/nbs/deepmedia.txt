[2023-04-22, 22:36:38] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Can anyone help with a very beginner level question

Like semantic search over text embeddings,can we embed images and perform semantic search over index of images? 

How to do that ,any articles/posts /python libraries like LangChain which can help get started ?
[2023-04-22, 22:38:06] Dev Aggarwal: Just use clip to convert image -> embeddings the same way you use ada for text -> embedings
[2023-04-22, 22:38:09] Amir Nagri: Haven't really tried image search, but one way would be to use CLIP model to generate image caption, and do semantic search over that
[2023-04-22, 22:39:22] ~ Jonathan Ve Vance: Leaving the clip vectors as it is would be more informative I think. Compared to getting a caption?
[2023-04-22, 22:39:42] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Then we can use same cosine similarity for calculating? Or is there another way to calculate similarity for image embeddings?
[2023-04-22, 22:39:55] Ojasvi Yadav: Easiest way and the cheapest way would be to take a small resent and chop off the last few flat layers
[2023-04-22, 22:40:05] Sudharshan GenAI: This is a good approach
[2023-04-22, 22:40:10] Ojasvi Yadav: Pick the last CNN layer
[2023-04-22, 22:40:19] Ojasvi Yadav: And use that as the model output
[2023-04-22, 22:40:32] Ojasvi Yadav: Those outputs will be your image embeddings
[2023-04-22, 22:40:43] Ojasvi Yadav: You can then index them in a vector DB
[2023-04-22, 22:41:03] Ojasvi Yadav: Or even save them in a CSV and train a KNN model over them for a proof of concept
[2023-04-22, 22:41:24] Ojasvi Yadav: *ResNet 

I would suggest ResNet 50
[2023-04-22, 22:43:10] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Won’t training be an overkill ? 
Also I’m a complete beginner to using CNN like ResNet
[2023-04-22, 22:43:54] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Goal is to create index of images for a particular class
And then get user input in text form to search for matching image objects
[2023-04-22, 22:43:56] ~ Jonathan Ve Vance: I agree. I think clip is more when we want to have a language-image correspondence. But with clip, you can do further cool things like getting a caption like @919611930033 suggested and run a search over it, etc
[2023-04-22, 22:44:26] Ojasvi Yadav: Bruh training a KNN is a easy peasy task
[2023-04-22, 22:44:27] ~ Jonathan Ve Vance: In this case I think you would need sth like clip.
[2023-04-22, 22:44:32] Ojasvi Yadav: Specially over a CSV set
[2023-04-22, 22:44:44] Ojasvi Yadav: More importantly it's cheap
[2023-04-22, 22:44:49] Ojasvi Yadav: Free TBH
[2023-04-22, 22:45:43] ~ Jonathan Ve Vance: I think @919971004124 is suggesting a training free approach.
[2023-04-22, 22:46:13] ~ Jonathan Ve Vance: Just KNN training yes, but KNN doesnt take any training time.

[2023-04-22, 22:49:30] Dev Aggarwal: I wonder if there’s a simple api for clip embeddings though
[2023-04-22, 22:51:35] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: I was wondering the same,if there’s an API for image embeddings 
Just like Ada-002 for text
[2023-04-22, 22:52:40] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Need to look into this and learn more.Absolute beginner on these things
[2023-04-22, 22:53:31] Shashank Generative AI Group: search clip-retriever on google, you'll find some github repos.

lexica.art etc also use CLIP for their search logic
[2023-04-22, 22:53:39] Ravi Theja: As @919971004124 suggested get clip embeddings of images…index them into a vector db…when user inputs the text get clip embeddings of text and do an ANN search. This will give very good results. 

This is the flow we use for our product at Glance(Inmobi)

[2023-04-28, 10:25:29] ~ Prajwal: If you just want to try it out use thr training model available on replicate and generate outputs using the other model using replicate too.
[2023-04-28, 11:20:11] Shivendu Kumar: Something is wrong. I did it a while back with 15 images. It was around 30-50 mins. Try following this https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=70H03cv57-o
[2023-04-28, 11:21:39] Shivendu Kumar: You can check out civitai.com for interesting LoRas that you can combine with.

Ps: Lots of NSFW stuff. So be careful.
[2023-04-28, 11:23:25] Nirant K: The NSFW stuff is now only when you sign in. So if you're opening without signing in, it's pretty kosher
[2023-04-28, 11:25:01] Shivendu Kumar: Yeah. But still. It's full of weird things. 😂
[2023-04-28, 11:26:23] Nirant K: Weird and edgy 👍

It's also a bit addictive. @917407651462 and I've wasted hours just going through all the models, blends, merges and what not. The sheer canvas of human creativity
[2023-04-28, 11:30:40] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Whenever you think you’ve built something I cool, I go to civitai to be humbled by what other ppl call creativity. 😅
[2023-04-28, 11:31:30] Arvind N Generative AI Group: "built" - we are all getting there.
[2023-04-28, 11:31:32] Nirant K: Civitai is a constant reminder: it's the artist, not the tool which matters
[2023-04-28, 11:31:54] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Exactly.
[2023-04-28, 11:38:02] Arvind N Generative AI Group: How did LORA get mostly associated with the SD folks when it is just a general purpose fine tuning mechanism?
[2023-04-28, 11:55:59] Nirant K: First demos were SD, and most people have never read the actual code or paper
[2023-04-28, 14:44:41] Dev Aggarwal: Any experiments with large scale deployment of civitai scale lora models and finteunes? I've heard from octoml that they've been working on hotswapping models on the fly so its much faster to try new models, but no demo in sight
[2023-04-28, 14:45:33] Nirant K: Depending on what you count as large scale, Soumyadeep @917407651462 runs some of these models at Dashtoon in production
[2023-04-28, 14:45:48] Dev Aggarwal: I mean all of civit ai
[2023-04-28, 14:46:02] Dev Aggarwal: We run about 10 at gooey
[2023-04-28, 14:46:06] Sudharshan GenAI: Most have copyright and licensing issues - you’ll need to work with the model creators and do a royalty share like mage space
[2023-04-28, 14:46:18] Sudharshan GenAI: Else you end up in messy situations like the realistic vision guy
[2023-04-28, 14:46:26] Dev Aggarwal: Licensing issues on the outputs right?
[2023-04-28, 14:46:32] Dev Aggarwal: Hot loaded into ram
[2023-04-28, 14:46:34] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: We have around 20 loras hotswapping right now.
[2023-04-28, 14:46:34] Sudharshan GenAI: Models
[2023-04-28, 14:46:40] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Will have 100 in a week 😅
[2023-04-28, 14:47:00] Dev Aggarwal: Lovely
[2023-04-28, 14:47:06] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: We have our own Loras 😅
[2023-04-28, 14:47:15] Sudharshan GenAI: But funny thing is most civitai model licenses won’t hold in court - SD is in a hot mess itself
[2023-04-28, 14:47:41] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Had to write our own mega pipelines on diffusers to enable a lot of things.
[2023-04-28, 14:47:51] Amogh V: We’re training our own style and character Loras at Dashtoon so we’re fine!
[2023-04-28, 14:48:02] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Like controlnet with LORA with inpaint. Diffusers is also a mess :(
[2023-04-28, 14:48:32] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Today me and @919619491715 realised LORA within an inpainted area doesnt work. 🤷‍♂️
[2023-04-28, 14:48:42] Dev Aggarwal: Same, i did finteunes instead of lora so that took some extra memory management bs
[2023-04-28, 14:49:01] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: ^Do you mean dreambooth fine tunes?
[2023-04-28, 14:49:05] Amogh V: By fine tune your mean dreambooth?
[2023-04-28, 14:49:15] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Man that would mean you are shifting models from memory to GPU?
[2023-04-28, 14:50:22] Dev Aggarwal: Not sure. I mean stuff like openjourney

[2023-04-28, 14:51:45] Dev Aggarwal: It works quite well. 2 sec to move a full diffusion model from memory to gpu
[2023-04-28, 14:52:04] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Yea I saw this repo.
[2023-04-28, 14:52:18] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Pretty cool but would be so much pain when adding more no?
[2023-04-28, 14:52:25] Dev Aggarwal: Its an ease
[2023-04-28, 14:52:51] Dev Aggarwal: Like literally just send an api request with a new model id and it takes care of the download + offload
[2023-04-28, 14:53:43] Dev Aggarwal: I assume with lora this isn't that huge an issue? Cause the lora files are small
[2023-04-28, 14:57:18] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Yea.
[2023-04-28, 14:57:26] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Loras are far easier
[2023-04-28, 14:57:50] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Specially since we will soon have 100s of characters and 100s of styles.
[2023-04-28, 14:58:01] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: And would need mix and match too.
[2023-04-28, 14:58:25] Dev Aggarwal: Nice, is civit ai all loras?
[2023-04-28, 14:58:31] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: They have a mix.
[2023-04-28, 15:00:29] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: So, when I was in first month of dashtoon, I had blasted a mail/message to many civitai folks to understand how they are doing things.

Most people were actually non-engineers with GPU personal machines and were just doing tons of hit and trial. 
It was crazy the amount of hit and trial they were doing to get what they want. And many models were training for weeks on their personal GPU machines. 🙏

Thats when I realised, creativity is a very strong motivator. :P
[2023-04-28, 15:01:00] Dev Aggarwal: True user research right there
[2023-04-28, 15:01:03] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I remember someone who had ran a OS macro on Automatic111 to do a sweep on model merges with  weights.
[2023-04-28, 15:01:17] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: And from that they got a sexy merged model.
[2023-04-28, 15:01:36] Nirant K: Damn, the passion needed for these kinda hacks
[2023-04-28, 15:02:18] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Also, for folks who dont understand. OS macros also means you CANNOT use your PC at all then.
[2023-04-28, 15:04:47] Dev Aggarwal: Links? I can't find anything on google about os macros
[2023-04-28, 15:06:10] Dev Aggarwal: Unless I run out of ram (currently at 40gb 😅)
[2023-04-28, 15:08:27] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Its called something else in windows.
[2023-04-28, 15:08:32] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I am calling it macro.
[2023-04-28, 15:08:48] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Basically, record Button 1 press, then button 2 press and repeat types.
[2023-04-28, 15:09:38] Dev Aggarwal: Autoit 😂

[2023-04-28, 16:03:59] Dev Aggarwal: Oh beautiful hotkey. I used it to make my character run in circles in gta 🫣
[2023-04-28, 20:16:58] Vamshi: @918764022384 I noticed you have a text to audio beat generator. Any audio to audio models with text prompts for modification ?
[2023-04-28, 20:17:04] Vamshi: Do you recommend any library
[2023-04-28, 20:17:24] Vamshi: I had an old bookmark I meant to return to, but can’t seem to find it !

[2023-04-28, 21:37:56] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Properly pipelined models can eliminate most of the graphics designer tasks. These is going to enable a whole new demography that was never able to afford designers
[2023-04-28, 21:39:00] Dev Aggarwal: Also add photoshop as an LLM tool and we’re golden
[2023-04-28, 21:44:05] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: GPUs will be a bottleneck to make it affordable, and I’m not particularly a fan of cold boot-up on serverless. I wish someone still make an easy-to-use distributed torrent-like system so we can start renting every one of those underutilized gaming GPUs, millions of them.
[2023-04-28, 21:49:27] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: I use qblocks.cloud,  they do exactly this lol
[2023-04-28, 21:58:13] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Not really. I want something like steam+torrent, that anyone can install and start sharing their resources, and depending on resource availability and a list of supported models, dynamical load balancing takes place. There are some projects but nothing mainstream that can figure out usage tracking and billing.
[2023-04-28, 22:05:58] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Understood
[2023-04-28, 22:06:34] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Last I checked they were doing a POC with ps5
[2023-04-28, 22:10:54] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Maybe they are on that path. That's would be awesome if someone can achieve it on a scale. A global network of GPUs can drastically accelerate many open-source LLM training and affordable inference.

[2023-05-01, 16:31:47] Dev Aggarwal: https://github.com/dara-network/gooey-gpu/blob/main/common/deepfloyd.py

Just released the container for it too
[2023-05-01, 16:32:04] Kishore GenAI: Oh amazing. Thanks for Sharing

[2023-05-01, 16:33:57] Kishore GenAI: @918764022384 sharing cause you asked in the main group
[2023-05-01, 16:34:44] Dev Aggarwal: A1111 right?
[2023-05-01, 16:34:49] Kishore GenAI: Yes
[2023-05-01, 16:38:22] Kishore GenAI: There are still a few errors such as inability to use low vram setting which then crashes the system ram. Some leakage is present in that and the authors mentioned that they will look into it. Otherwise the entire update is over and it will now be only maintenance till sdxl gets released. 

Additionally HF also has a sprint for controlnet which should get over today or tomorrow , so you can expect there will be more models which will be released
[2023-05-01, 16:39:42] Digvijay GenAI Group: Amazing results 
Can you please share some reference on multi controlnet and how can I use it ? 

Is it similar to multimodal prompting ? https://github.com/muzairkhattak/multimodal-prompt-learning
[2023-05-01, 16:42:26] Digvijay GenAI Group: Oops I think it’s this one https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=aY39egKfEfQ
@919500192175 can you plz confirm ?
[2023-05-01, 16:43:22] Kishore GenAI: Sure give me sometime I will see and respond
[2023-05-01, 16:44:43] Digvijay GenAI Group: Sure 🙂
One more question whenever you find time - are you able to use this with SD 2 or 2.1 with mask inpaint ?
[2023-05-01, 16:46:09] Kishore GenAI: No. These are trained for SDv1.5
[2023-05-01, 16:46:38] Kishore GenAI: I think you can try with others but then the architecture is not the same therefore it might not work.
[2023-05-01, 16:47:04] Kishore GenAI: When I tried it a couple of months ago that was the understanding and I think it is still the same.
[2023-05-01, 16:47:13] Kishore GenAI: This is the same as what I did.
[2023-05-01, 16:48:32] Digvijay GenAI Group: Got it sir , thankss !!
[2023-05-01, 16:49:01] Kishore GenAI: There are other controlnets which work with SDv2
[2023-05-01, 16:49:23] Digvijay GenAI Group: Quite surprised the generation looks so realistic with SD 1.5
[2023-05-01, 16:50:28] Kishore GenAI: https://twitter.com/thibaudz/status/1646412387250044928?s=20
[2023-05-01, 16:50:32] Digvijay GenAI Group: As far as I could see there are controlnet models available with SD2 and various controls but it’s not available for masking inpaint
[2023-05-01, 16:51:24] Kishore GenAI: Okay. But if the extension is present it should work for all types of controlnet and base models. Maybe give it a shot and see
[2023-05-01, 16:51:46] Kishore GenAI: My understanding is that controlnets should work
[2023-05-01, 16:53:04] Digvijay GenAI Group: Spent 3 days last week , controlnets with depth/canny/hed controls worked well with SD2.
The only challenge is when I tried to also merge it with SD2.1 mask-inpaint model , it gave miserable outputs
[2023-05-01, 16:53:58] Digvijay GenAI Group: * Merging SD mask-inpaint dint work very well on both 2 and 2.1 versions

[2023-05-01, 16:57:32] Kishore GenAI: Not as api. I tried it in dream studio. Didn’t feel it was good in comparison to sdv1.5 with controlnet.
[2023-05-01, 16:57:39] Amir Nagri: Are weights available? Last update i had was only through dreamstudio
[2023-05-01, 16:57:44] Kishore GenAI: Will wait till it is released
[2023-05-01, 16:59:39] Kishore GenAI: I don’t think I will spend anytime this month on model updating though. I am satisfied with the capabilities now, and will wait for others to release and work on better models and photorealism.

[2023-05-01, 17:06:52] Kishore GenAI: @918764022384 have you ever trained any models here for specific style? Like the one in playgroundai.  Any idea on how big a dataset is required to get a specific art style and how you would go about getting that?
[2023-05-01, 22:23:46] Dev Aggarwal: I have not done this, but replicate has an API to train Loras (5-10) images. - https://replicate.com/blog/lora-faster-fine-tuning-of-stable-diffusion

One other way is to do finetunes via dreambooth - https://replicate.com/blog/dreambooth-api

@917407651462 and gang are the experts on this 😅
‎[2023-05-01, 22:25:19] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: ‎GIF omitted
[2023-05-01, 22:27:16] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: We haven’t done styles as much but it needs far more images than character from what I’ve done a few times. 

Also, very hard to really evaluate if a style is good or not. 

My advice is to do a dream booth if you’re doing a base style over which you’re doing things.
[2023-05-01, 22:36:46] Kishore GenAI: Thanks
[2023-05-01, 22:37:49] Dev Aggarwal: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lSUPMSKdfZo

Also love this channel, very fun!
[2023-05-01, 22:38:08] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Is there a specific thing you’re trying? Both style and character is far more about the data than the training technique. Nailing that has been most of our effort.
[2023-05-01, 22:47:08] Kishore GenAI: I am trying to integrate a specific Instagram page style to new images. Say every image has bright colours as it palette, I wanted to make newer images of similar style with it. Some might be very low key realistic photos in studio, others in lifestyle outdoors, etc. I wanted a way to capture all that into a process so that I can replicate it when needed
[2023-05-01, 23:09:18] Shimanta Generative AI: I remember some discussion around a photobooth concept using SD in the other group some time back.

[2023-05-03, 18:14:01] Jay Pokarna 2014 BPCC: Prompt?
[2023-05-03, 18:29:45] Amogh V: I tweaked the prompt with each iteration to get this. If you have a specific composition in mind you have to keep iterating. So through several iterations some of the prompts used to create this include
"impressionism oil on canvas painting, thick brush strokes, palette knife technique"
"art by Lisa Pressman, Beksinski"
while inpainting specific parts -
"a standing man"
"third eye with red iris"
[2023-05-03, 18:30:06] Amogh V: So the first iteration and the last iteration had very different prompts
[2023-05-03, 18:30:32] Amogh V: Negative prompt included "photograph, 3D render, realistic"
[2023-05-03, 18:32:21] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Inpainting seems like the secret sauce here!!
Most People typically just try single prompt!
[2023-05-03, 18:34:42] Amogh V: Yeah single prompt iteration usually gives underwhelming results
[2023-05-03, 18:34:56] Amogh V: Secret sauce changes based on what you want to do

[2023-05-03, 19:09:37] Ojasvi Yadav: There are products available for professional photographers that perform this function. These products process approximately 5,000 images that the photographer has edited in the past. They utilize Adobe Lightroom files, which store the numerical representation of these edits. A model is then trained on the mappings between the original image and the edits that the photographer has applied.
[2023-05-03, 19:10:24] Ojasvi Yadav: Essentially, it performs a style transfer (in this case, "style" refers to the numerical representation of the edits that the photographer tends to prefer). As far as I know, their customers love it. Photographers who use these products save a significant amount of time, particularly those specializing in event photography. Photographers in this niche can work for two hours and end up having 2,000 images to edit manually. Therefore, these products save a great deal of time by streamlining this tedious aspect of photography.
[2023-05-03, 19:10:45] Ojasvi Yadav: In your case, the situation is different. You don't have the numerical information on the type of edit from an Instagram page. Additionally, you don't have the luxury of working with a 50MB RAW format image, which has a diverse 14-bit value-space for a pixel and a resolution large enough to print a highway billboard. Instead, you only have an 8-bit JPEG with a resolution that pixelates if you zoom in even 110% on the picture.
[2023-05-03, 19:11:12] Ojasvi Yadav: Based on what you specified, it seems you want to apply not just colours and filters, but also compositional changes to a separate picture, based on a given Instagram account. While this is not impossible, you'll need to think of a clever workaround for these limitations and resources you're dealing with.
[2023-05-03, 19:11:27] Ojasvi Yadav: Your ideal solution will have an understanding of what the average instagram picture looks like. Then you have to find a way to quantify the difference between the average instagram picture and the pictures of the account you want to test this on. With this difference quantified, you can then begin to frame this problem around translating this numerical difference to a "style", compositional or filter-based.
[2023-05-03, 19:13:18] Ojasvi Yadav: first-authored 2 papers in this domain, feel free to DM
[2023-05-03, 19:13:30] Shivendu Kumar: Are you talking about LUTs, or something else?
[2023-05-03, 19:17:19] Amogh V: Very easy way to do this - 
1. Screenshot some of the instagram images whose style you want. 
2. Upload them in Automatic's image2image CLIP interrogator which will give you a prompt most likely to recreate that image. 
3. There will usually be at least one artist along with medium like "digital art" or "oil painting". Copy these style reference words.
4. Repeat this for few images. 
5. Apply consolidated style words in your prompt to get something very close to the style you want.

Optional - Add words in negative prompt according to the style. like if the style is illustrative add "photo, hyper realistic, photorealistic" in your negative prompt

[2023-05-03, 19:30:32] Amogh V: Another trick is to use Controlnet with the t2ia_style_clipvision preprocessor and the t2iadapter_style_sd14v1 model for style transfer. I usually set the controlnet weight around for this
‎[2023-05-03, 19:30:46] Amogh V: ‎image omitted

[2023-05-04, 10:36:51] Kishore GenAI: Does anyone here know how to create a 3d model of a product based on its input images. Something similar to what Google has done with its nerf? 

Usecase is that i have a particular product image, however, the perspective is incorrect with relation to the base template i would want to see it in. I want to be able to rotate or place the product in a particular angle I want in the base image. Any ideas on what to do here?
[2023-05-04, 10:39:15] Amogh V: Capture nerf of a product, rotate it in  proper orientation, screenshot/extract image and inpaint it in
[2023-05-04, 10:39:32] Amogh V: 3D reconstruction from single image is ridiculously difficult
[2023-05-04, 10:39:47] Kishore GenAI: I dont have the product with me. I am downloading a set of product images from the internet.
[2023-05-04, 10:40:01] Kishore GenAI: Not a single image. Think of amazon listing. Front, side and back

[2023-05-07, 20:58:49] Ojasvi Yadav: What's the reason behind midjourney not being able to work for prompts like "woman winking"?

It should be knowing the semantics of a wink and semantics of a woman's face. So what could be the reason behind this behaviour?
[2023-05-07, 20:59:29] Amogh V: Training data is the only explanation
[2023-05-07, 21:01:10] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: The amount of time Amogh, me and dashtoon content has spent to get winking is 🙏
[2023-05-07, 21:02:01] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: My sense is most training data is coming from publically available images with descriptions as alt text OR BLIP captioning. Both of which doesnt have a lot of expressions, poses etc.
[2023-05-07, 21:02:06] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Winking is one.
[2023-05-07, 21:02:29] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Check out models like Anythingv5 though.
[2023-05-07, 21:02:42] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: It has winking coz trained with anime which has fair amount of winking.
‎[2023-05-07, 23:08:03] Amogh V: ‎image omitted
[2023-05-07, 23:08:40] Amogh V: It's a long process right now, but will be turning it into a feature
[2023-05-07, 23:11:39] Dev Aggarwal: There are 2 prompts here right?
[2023-05-07, 23:12:00] Dev Aggarwal: One for astronaut + scene  and one for cybertruck
[2023-05-07, 23:12:06] Dev Aggarwal: Or do you use same prompt for both
[2023-05-07, 23:13:35] Amogh V: right, 2 prompts
[2023-05-07, 23:14:09] Dev Aggarwal: Curious about how different / similar they have to be
[2023-05-07, 23:14:42] Dev Aggarwal: If they are independent of each other then it opens up new possibilities for automating this kind of workflow I think
[2023-05-07, 23:14:58] Amogh V: it depends on how you are doing the inpainting. if your inpainting mode is "only masked" you are better off prompting only what is going to come inside the mask. Otherwise you will get the entire scene generated inside the mask. this is more problematic when the inpainting area size is small. not so much when you're inpainting a large area. but this is subjective
[2023-05-07, 23:16:41] Amogh V: when you are inpainting using "whole area" you want to keep your prompt the same. but if your scene has multiple objects / subjects like car, tree, human, you may or may not get exactly what you want in the mask
[2023-05-07, 23:18:42] Dev Aggarwal: Can’t wait to play with this!
[2023-05-07, 23:19:02] Amogh V: also if there's already some existing object like a car under the mask and you're trying to improve it, you could use "whole area" and the same prompt with low denoising strength. but if the area behind the mask is not at all what you want to paint in then use "only masked" with high denoising strength and change the prompt
[2023-05-07, 23:20:29] Amogh V: i wouldn't call these rules though. some of the decision making around inpainting and parameters is more art than science 😛
[2023-05-07, 23:21:48] Dev Aggarwal: Deep Latent space exploration 🚀
[2023-05-07, 23:23:29] Amogh V: when i use "only masked" and need to change the prompt i usually just change the subject words but keep the style related words the same. like in this one I changed it to "a futuristic dark grey truck" while keeping the style related words "depth of field, wide angle shot, cel shading, flat color" as the same
[2023-05-07, 23:25:21] Amogh V: sometimes while using "only masked" inpainting mode you can get away with increasing prompt weights for the subject you want under the mask. like (a car:1.4) if you are using Automatic1111 or a platform that supports similar prompt weights.
[2023-05-07, 23:27:40] Dev Aggarwal: Wow, I feel like there’s great compositonality wins here if gpt4’s spatial awareness capabilities are combined with this technique
[2023-05-07, 23:48:46] Amogh V: Working on something in that direction at Dashtoon. Not using GPT4 though. But definitely composition superpowers.

[2023-05-09, 00:00:21] Soumendra Dhanee: @919619491715 in your experience, how effective is it to combine multi-control nets to place multiple things inside a scene, like 7 or 8 people or cars etc?
[2023-05-09, 00:00:58] Soumendra Dhanee: If anyone else has experience doing this please share your experience
[2023-05-09, 07:08:34] Amogh V: The more highly detailed subjects you’re trying to get in a single space the harder it is to get the details right
[2023-05-09, 07:09:49] Amogh V: Using multi controlnet or not depends on your exact use case, level of detail required, art style, whether it’s close up or long shot etc
[2023-05-09, 07:10:55] Amogh V: You could give it a shot of course. But I think multiple iterations of multi controlnet might work better. For example you get 1 or 2 people right using open pose in the first one and use the output as next input
[2023-05-09, 14:18:55] Vamshi: Is there any popular howto that covers using controlnet to generate an animated video from a moving camera ?
[2023-05-09, 14:19:34] Vamshi: I’ve seen one that covers static camera angles by giving all the example shots as part of the source image
[2023-05-09, 14:19:46] Vamshi: But haven’t found a good one for a moving camera

[2023-05-09, 21:04:45] Sidhant Sequoia: Runway is great for 100% synthetically generated very short stills 

InVideo is great for creating ads etc with a single prompt that could be 15-120 secs with voiceover + insertion of very specific voice footage via vector search.

Depending on your use case you could figure.

@919920634169 can add more
[2023-05-09, 21:05:05] Sidhant Sequoia: ~voice footage~ stock video footage
[2023-05-09, 21:05:54] Soumendra Dhanee: Yeah, they have a template based approach, but coming out with an ai version. The demo was 🔥
[2023-05-09, 21:06:13] Sidhant Sequoia: I’m referring to the AI product
[2023-05-09, 21:06:44] Sidhant Sequoia: Demo is indeed 🎯😊
[2023-05-09, 21:07:10] Ambika Computational Mama: For a creator 
Working tool >> demo 🤷‍♀️
[2023-05-09, 21:10:54] Amir Nagri: Any links for the demo?
[2023-05-09, 21:17:17] Anshul Khandelwal Invideo: The video ai space has grown quite big and has lots of tools and players doing good work. There is text to clip, deforum,  text to talking head, text based animation pipelines, highlight generation and text to video essay as the main categories.   Tons of players doing interesting work...
[2023-05-09, 21:18:55] Anshul Khandelwal Invideo: We are currently building https://invideo.io/ai/
[2023-05-09, 21:20:59] Sudharshan GenAI: Very cool demo
[2023-05-09, 21:23:53] Anshul Khandelwal Invideo: I suppose you meant kaiber.ai which is a player on the deforum side.  RunwayML has done some very interesting work on the text to diffusion clip side.  Picsart's text2video-zero would be my favourite on the open source side.
[2023-05-09, 21:24:16] Ambika Computational Mama: Yes thanks
[2023-05-09, 21:25:00] Anshul Khandelwal Invideo: We are in early stages of experimenting and evaluating if we should mount an attack on the text to clip diffusion side.  If anyone wants to train foundation video models from scratch or has interesting ideas on how to leverage the pretraining on image diffusion models do ping me.
[2023-05-09, 21:26:05] Sudharshan GenAI: That would be great - big fan of modelscope
[2023-05-09, 21:26:22] Sudharshan GenAI: Runway's gen-2 looks incredible
[2023-05-09, 21:26:36] Sudharshan GenAI: Btw where all are you using AI in this?  (Apart from text and narrative creation)
[2023-05-09, 21:29:26] Amogh V: Right now creating comics, but would love to create animated series using AI.
[2023-05-09, 21:29:47] Sudharshan GenAI: Oh didn't know you're the current CTO - was chilling with Sid in dharamshala a few weeks back :)
[2023-05-09, 21:34:36] Anshul Khandelwal Invideo: There is a bunch of stuff going on behind the scenes.  The generative tech that is not yet where it generates something you would put on youtube so won't see the light of day just yet.  We will probably release them as side apps or discord bots as they mature.  The long term goal of the tool on https://invideo.io/ai/ is to be a full end to end text to film solution.  A long way to go.
[2023-05-09, 21:48:07] Ambika Computational Mama: Nice- this looks super

[2023-05-10, 15:25:50] Rasagy Sharma: Sweet, looking forward to @919619491715 speaking here! 🙌
[2023-05-10, 15:27:00] Rasagy Sharma: (Thanks for cross-posting, I’m clearly not able to keep up with what’s happening in the other group regularly) 😅
[2023-05-10, 15:54:14] Sudharshan GenAI: Any good newsletters focussed on SD, controlnet and deepmedia? Something niched down
[2023-05-10, 15:54:20] Sudharshan GenAI: Not like Ben's bites
[2023-05-10, 16:03:12] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I thought you were running one no? 😅
[2023-05-10, 16:25:04] Sudharshan GenAI: Yes but that's not SD specific
[2023-05-10, 16:36:35] Prayank Swaroop Accel: What's your newsletter ?
[2023-05-10, 16:37:53] Shashank Generative AI Group: here u go: https://aiartweekly.com/issues/32
[2023-05-10, 16:38:10] Sudharshan GenAI: https://frontierai.beehiiv.com

Mostly AI news, products and resources. 

Inactive for the past few weeks. Getting a content guy onboard to scale ops.
[2023-05-10, 17:44:18] ~ Kaustav: Why get someone when you can automate ?
[2023-05-10, 18:24:39] Sudharshan GenAI: Sup Kaustav, nice to see you here :)
[2023-05-10, 18:24:50] Sudharshan GenAI: Hard to automate good content - what are your ideas though?
[2023-05-10, 18:49:08] Vamshi: Came across this today, but no colab or github.

https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.03027
[2023-05-10, 18:49:42] Vamshi: If someone finds something runnable along those lines do share!
[2023-05-10, 18:53:13] ~ Kaustav: Naïve, but if some top publications are scraped by keyword, then assign a score based on theme? Probably a simple google sheet would collate all sources and then you can rewrite the content in your tone using chatgpt ?

[2023-05-11, 11:21:57] Ambika Computational Mama: Upasana is also a collaborator of @918890571387 - they made an amazing AI interactive installation in March
[2023-05-11, 11:24:23] Hasan Tech Art: She’s doing amazing stuff. We have multiple collaborations in the pipeline utilising AI in various ways. This one is definitely worth attending.
[2023-05-11, 11:29:06] DeepMedia / diffusion and audio tools: ‎You changed the group description

[2023-05-11, 22:10:19] Ojasvi Yadav: Maybe we can share a few midjourney pictures every now and then whenever the group gets stale
[2023-05-11, 22:10:33] Ojasvi Yadav: The prompt I used for the pictures above:

a comic drawing of a pretty woman in front Delhi store, small dress, Indian landscape, saturated plain colors, american scene matte painting, matte drawing, detailed, by artgerm and skottie young --niji 5 --style expressive --s 250 --s 250
[2023-05-11, 22:11:00] Hasan Tech Art: @919930161215 welcome to the group. We were just talking about the BIC event on 22nd.

https://twitter.com/javilopen/status/1656266534782742541?s=46&t=WT1iAtjftW-5_e62F8FZTg
[2023-05-11, 22:54:36] Shimanta Generative AI: I have used up 2 free accounts for Midjourney trying stuff 😂😢
[2023-05-11, 22:54:44] Ojasvi Yadav: Yes. I love his work!
[2023-05-11, 22:54:54] Shimanta Generative AI: This is a great style for comics I believe
[2023-05-11, 22:56:37] Shimanta Generative AI: Like it was earlier mentioned in a conversation in this group, having knowledge of artists and artistic styles is key to generating great images 
People already in that space are best suited to capitalise with these tools
‎[2023-05-11, 23:00:12] ~ Pranav: ‎image omitted
[2023-05-11, 23:00:22] ~ Pranav: Not what I was envisioning but came out looking like album art :p
[2023-05-11, 23:00:25] Ambika Computational Mama: As some from the field I can attest that artistic styles work better than artists
‎[2023-05-11, 23:01:13] ~ Pranav: ‎image omitted
[2023-05-11, 23:01:16] Ambika Computational Mama: there is no credit or royalty to the artists so effectively this practice is both incorrect and also in poor taste
[2023-05-11, 23:01:36] ~ Upasana Switch: Thank you for adding me! hope to see some of the bangalore people there!
[2023-05-11, 23:02:43] Ambika Computational Mama: I dont want to diminish your enthusiasm in anyway but I think we must practice care in prompting
[2023-05-11, 23:05:01] Ambika Computational Mama: It is more important to be able to harness these tools to improve your storytelling or creative capabilities than flexing the best knowledge of art history (that will only take you 8 episodes of Simon Schama's "Power of Art").
[2023-05-11, 23:05:21] Ojasvi Yadav: We are simply using the service. I'm sure these concerns are better directed towards creators of these models.
[2023-05-11, 23:05:43] Ojasvi Yadav: As end users we simply aren't equiped to defend them
[2023-05-11, 23:06:19] Ambika Computational Mama: We definitely are!
[2023-05-11, 23:06:34] ~ Upasana Switch: its been extremely interesting to use it for quick storyboarding to align collaborating teams and clients
[2023-05-11, 23:06:38] Ambika Computational Mama: How are you responding to a 5Billion image dataset is totally on you as an artist! :)
[2023-05-11, 23:07:08] Ambika Computational Mama: We cannot have this brush-off attitude and praise the tech :)
[2023-05-11, 23:07:18] Ambika Computational Mama: It must all go hand in hand! :)
[2023-05-11, 23:15:55] ~ Dhruv: ‎~ Dhruv joined using this group's invite link
[2023-05-11, 23:16:25] Shimanta Generative AI: I have a genuine question I’d like to know the answers to. Not trying to spark debate.
How does an artist come up with a drawing or painting? 
My simple understanding is that they start with an idea, which might be influenced by some other piece of art and/or something they see. Then they add layers on top of that idea to refine it and produce the end piece. I might be wrong here though.

This process, as I see isn’t any different than what the underlying technology of tools like Stable Diffusion use, to generate images.
[2023-05-11, 23:18:55] Swastik Banerjee: “start with an idea” is the critical part ig
[2023-05-11, 23:19:17] Swastik Banerjee: The “idea” is where humans pour in all creativity?
[2023-05-11, 23:19:39] Shimanta Generative AI: And this step is identical in both scenarios I believe
[2023-05-11, 23:19:56] Shimanta Generative AI: Whether putting paint on paper, or typing in a prompt in the tool
[2023-05-11, 23:20:40] ~ Prajna Prayas: As someone who last painted in high school a while back, it feels awesome when I create something aesthetic in MidJourney or any other tool and enrich my brain cells with art history and camera angles.
[2023-05-11, 23:21:04] Divya Tak: yup the difference isn't in the artistic merit, but in the craft. even people who make arguments against it are arguing for craft
[2023-05-11, 23:23:21] Shimanta Generative AI: What do we mean by craft here?
[2023-05-11, 23:23:30] ~ Prajna Prayas: But don't you think the heavy lifting of creation has been done by the machine already?
[2023-05-11, 23:24:04] Divya Tak: the mechanical skill required
[2023-05-11, 23:24:18] Divya Tak: so for example the difference between electronic music vs playing acoustic instrument
[2023-05-11, 23:24:24] Divya Tak: craft is different
[2023-05-11, 23:24:45] Shimanta Generative AI: I see what you meant
[2023-05-11, 23:25:05] Shimanta Generative AI: You can cut a log by an axe, or use a machine chainsaw. Just saying
[2023-05-11, 23:25:30] Ambika Computational Mama: there is no ethical implication to the MACHINE/SERVER because it has effectively "training" and "learned" this 🫠

i think its more important that are informed and educated and creative beings are able to make the right boundaries between blantantly stealing a style and claiming as our own vs. using the tools in the right way

I mean I can easily photoshop money but should I? I can eaily copy someone's style on photoshop but should? :P
[2023-05-11, 23:25:56] Ambika Computational Mama: not if you are cutting someone's finger in the process
[2023-05-11, 23:26:11] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Not here too 🤦‍♂️. I thought we are going to leave this discussion to Twitter only.
[2023-05-11, 23:26:29] Ambika Computational Mama: hahaha
[2023-05-11, 23:26:52] Ambika Computational Mama: I like @19377081307 already!
[2023-05-11, 23:29:10] Shimanta Generative AI: Isn’t it the same way as we as humans have learned stuff from other humans, and then we try building on top of that or applying a variation of what we learnt?
[2023-05-11, 23:29:50] Ambika Computational Mama: oh I wish! Tristan Harris videos here would be useful. 

However I will close this here and share this buatiful project by Marjole https://www.wondermash.eu/blog/a-short-experiment-in-futures-dreaming-with-ai
[2023-05-11, 23:29:56] Ambika Computational Mama: made with Midjourney
[2023-05-11, 23:30:15] Ambika Computational Mama: beautiful*
[2023-05-11, 23:30:40] Amogh V: Well the model is trained using images and their captions fed into it. The captions contained the artist names and the simplest way to consistently get the stylistic results you want is to include artist names with art styles since the model recognises these.
A human artist’s brain learns by recreating the work of other artists they admire over hours and hours of practice. This is the same, but on a much much larger scale. Human studies Picasso to create cubism paintings, just as the model does.
Artists are actually equipped to use these tools better than anyone else right now. They have already trained to understand perspective, anatomy, lighting etc. The best users of AI art tools will be already accomplished artists, should they choose to. Stable Diffusion and Midjourney enable ordinary folk to accomplish what mid level artists can today. For the already accomplished, it’s a rocket ship.
Always raise the floor, never pull down the ceiling.
[2023-05-11, 23:31:44] Amogh V: Nobody is cutting off anyone’s finger here though. Technology is never a zero sum game.
[2023-05-11, 23:31:53] Ambika Computational Mama: that last sentence is a bit problematic (but maybe I should sign up on twitter to continue)! :)
[2023-05-11, 23:32:06] Ambika Computational Mama: same answer as above! :)
[2023-05-11, 23:32:33] Ambika Computational Mama: I really enjoyed your twitch stream recently ❤️ very cool workflow
[2023-05-11, 23:32:51] Amogh V: Thank you!
[2023-05-11, 23:35:19] Amogh V: I don’t think I’ll ever stop believing in raise the floor, don’t pull down the ceiling though. It is the only way for civilisational progress.
[2023-05-11, 23:37:12] Ambika Computational Mama: ceilings need load bearing pillars and eventually there will be so many that there will no room for us to stand! :)
[2023-05-11, 23:37:31] Ambika Computational Mama: ok I'm closing now - maybe admins can have a rule for this!
[2023-05-11, 23:40:09] Ambika Computational Mama: Will DM you @919619491715  ;) sorry to cause this late night craziness
[2023-05-11, 23:40:35] Amogh V: Pulling down the ceiling is regress. Stagnation. Deceleration. Impossible, actually. Entropy cannot be reversed.
[2023-05-11, 23:42:55] Ambika Computational Mama: .
[2023-05-11, 23:43:00] Ambika Computational Mama: .
[2023-05-11, 23:43:56] ~ Kaustav: Being pedantic here, but isn't entropy actually moving towards a settled steady steady instead of excitation 😝
[2023-05-11, 23:44:39] Amogh V: Exactly the opposite
[2023-05-11, 23:44:55] Amogh V: Entropy of the universe is always increasing
[2023-05-11, 23:45:07] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: We did but some days I wake up and choose violence. 😅
[2023-05-11, 23:45:30] ~ Kaustav: Yes because at some point of time it will stop expanding and start crunching
[2023-05-11, 23:46:11] Amogh V: I mean, now we’re discussing physics 😛
[2023-05-11, 23:46:38] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: But I guess we should take this to some evening over beer/coffee. I don’t think this debate has a closure. It is two interesting point of views. 

But one of the views can hurt folks so let’s rest at that.
[2023-05-11, 23:47:53] ~ Kaustav: Also, I do not know if we are raising the ceiling. Yes, the common person gets more equipped. But the masters will lose faith in their craft. The Piccasos and Greg Rutkowskis of tomorrow, who are genre defining stalwarts will lessen over time.
Though this is the price we pay for progress.
[2023-05-11, 23:49:31] ~ 9.5: ‎~ 9.5 joined using this group's invite link
[2023-05-11, 23:50:12] Ambika Computational Mama: but as some who is now (thanks to @918764022384 ) earning a livelihood from prompting (and was in the past on the artistic side of things). PRO TIP: learn art history for the soul not for the prompting!
[2023-05-11, 23:51:33] ~ Kaustav: Being a designer myself my love for history is this 🙂
[2023-05-11, 23:51:45] Ambika Computational Mama: ❤️
[2023-05-11, 23:52:31] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: You can buy a knife from costco or ask a Japanese master to make it for you. There is demand for both but it helps people who never had chance to even afford it before. Checkout what we build, automated labeling packaging for farmers or product showcase using GenAI.
[2023-05-11, 23:53:30] Amogh V: Btw, at the intersection of art, physics, and AI - FANTASTIC short story by Isaac Asimov illustrated in a graphic novel https://imgur.io/t/the%20last%20question
[2023-05-11, 23:53:51] ~ Kaustav: Yes but there 6 japanese blademasters, while in the 1800s there were thousands. Price of progress as I was saying.
[2023-05-11, 23:55:24] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: There were arrow making artist and craftsman who build bullock carts. Art and craft is a temporal concept. New artist are born, old adept or vanish.
[2023-05-11, 23:55:38] ~ Kaustav: Is this created at Dashtoom ?
[2023-05-11, 23:55:45] ~ Kaustav: toon*
[2023-05-11, 23:56:19] Amogh V: If you enjoy even one of these subjects you will love this. If you enjoy all 3 🙋‍♂️ it might just become your favourite short story of all time. Especially relevant for this topic and the time we live in. It’s a long one in more than 1 part because of some imgur restrictions
[2023-05-11, 23:56:38] Amogh V: I wish! This is years old.
[2023-05-11, 23:56:58] Amogh V: But quality wise we can do this by now
[2023-05-11, 23:57:08] ~ Kaustav: Good idea though. bringing classic stories to life
[2023-05-11, 23:58:34] ~ Kaustav: Someday a kid will ask Google Assistant to show him a story and it would be crafted in real time on TV to watch 😌
[2023-05-11, 23:59:48] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Why tv and not in AR on the artificial lens the kid is wearing
[2023-05-12, 00:00:31] Amogh V: Beam from Starlink satellite directly into brain
[2023-05-12, 00:00:49] ~ Kaustav: Hardware is a tougher battle though
[2023-05-12, 00:00:50] Amogh V: Pay $8 per month to remove ads
[2023-05-12, 00:01:08] Shimanta Generative AI: Or directly generate with a Neuralink
[2023-05-12, 00:01:16] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Ads straight into the mind
[2023-05-12, 00:01:20] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Dystopia max
[2023-05-12, 00:01:25] Aakash Kumar  Matrix Partners: Not to throw technicalities (given the discussion trail) Asimov doesn’t qualify as a ‘classic’ yet as per widely accepted tenets in context of literature 😜 
#asimovfanboi just clarifying
[2023-05-12, 00:01:33] ~ Kaustav: A black mirror episode
[2023-05-12, 00:01:53] ~ Kaustav: Is this payback for entropysplaining 😉
[2023-05-12, 00:02:31] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: The goal of the ads is to sell something, why don't we use AI to convince them to buy directly.
[2023-05-12, 00:02:45] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: AI should kill the whole ads industry
[2023-05-12, 00:02:48] ~ Kaustav: Personalised curated compelling ad content
[2023-05-12, 00:03:05] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Isn’t that what ads try to do too?
[2023-05-12, 00:03:23] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: More like a salesman
[2023-05-12, 00:03:32] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: And not advertiser
[2023-05-12, 00:03:59] Amogh V: Once AI has control of our bank accounts humans must make ads that are clickbait for AI
[2023-05-12, 00:04:08] Amogh V: Then the circle will be complete
[2023-05-12, 00:04:50] ~ Kaustav: Captcha power
[2023-05-12, 00:06:34] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: YouTube almost does it
[2023-05-12, 00:06:36] Amogh V: On that note if anyone watches The Mandalorian, in the S3 episode with Jack Black and Lizzo there’s a scene where the robot droids are worried that their jobs will be taken over by humans. Insane moment in an otherwise dumb episode (and season)
[2023-05-12, 00:08:38] ~ Kaustav: The droids in the SW Universe are mostly terrible though
[2023-05-12, 00:09:04] ~ Kaustav: Literally why someone thought of making a clone army 😂
[2023-05-12, 00:09:08] Aakash Kumar  Matrix Partners: Not really. Just threw that in as a pov for the debate. Tenets of classic , what is art etc .. are a conception of humans. 

No point holding them too tightly.

Sculptors found paintings to be not art! Painters found digital art to be not art. 

First principles: text/video/image are mediums of expression. And forever all artists have rendered using some form of mental composition and tools. Mental compositions even earlier were inspired by each others works for artists. Just that they didn’t explicitly use it in a prompt 🙂
[2023-05-12, 00:09:21] ~ Gayatri: ‎~ Gayatri left
[2023-05-12, 00:10:23] Shashank Generative AI Group: yeah that felt like a filler episode. but i did like the season plot revolving around Mandalore.
[2023-05-12, 00:14:44] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Thoughts > Chisel > Paintbrush > Keyboard > Voice > Thoughts

[2023-05-12, 00:33:48] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Another topic: Anyone tried cloning Arijit, Kishore, Jagjit or Rahman's voices, yet? Not getting time to do so but all the tools are there. If you have done it, would appreciate model file.
[2023-05-12, 00:34:57] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Could you please guide how to do this?
[2023-05-12, 00:37:53] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: This discord has everything https://discord.gg/aihub
[2023-05-12, 00:48:51] Hasan Tech Art: The training process requires voice samples without music. You can use the online tools or source separation AI models to extract just the vocal of a that singer from songs and use that data to fine tune the model. I have tried multiple voices it works very well, haven’t trained any models yet, didn’t get time to. But I’m looking into how can I connect this code with Ableton live for real-time voice  change with music production.
[2023-05-12, 00:50:02] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: How much sample do you need?
[2023-05-12, 00:50:13] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: All the links for tools and steps are there in one of the discord channels. Nicely curated tutorials for a discord.

How do you make it stop hallucinating?

How do you make it deterministic (give a seed)

When will you release voice cloning? If not, is the voice cloning fork really the best you haveb
[2023-05-12, 07:15:01] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: When are the making it available for training!

Came across https://github.com/VoltaML/voltaML-fast-stable-diffusion

Not looking for CPU only solution. GPUs are not a constraint. 

Just want fast.

[2023-05-12, 10:33:13] Dev Aggarwal: Meeting with them today - will share notes :)
[2023-05-12, 10:33:46] Dev Aggarwal: Also just latest diffusers with fp16 is like pretty fast. 4-5 sec for 768x768 50 steps
[2023-05-12, 10:33:59] Dev Aggarwal: And pytorch 3 has compile() too
[2023-05-12, 10:34:53] Dev Aggarwal: https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion


Replicate for eg is getting 3 sec
[2023-05-12, 10:36:52] Harsh Koo: Have checked out replicate. I believe they have more resourceful GPUs.
[2023-05-12, 10:37:05] Dev Aggarwal: A100
[2023-05-12, 10:37:31] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Wait, with xformers on my 3090 does it in less than a second for 512x512
[2023-05-12, 10:38:16] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Pardon me if I missed any context
[2023-05-12, 10:38:25] Dev Aggarwal: Yup those gaming gpus are faster than these data center ones. https://youtu.be/zBAxiQi2nPc
[2023-05-12, 11:50:47] Vignesh Baskaran: For how many steps?
[2023-05-12, 11:55:10] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: How fast? in it/s ?
[2023-05-12, 11:55:35] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I already did a week back. DM after you are done 😅
[2023-05-12, 12:23:07] Vignesh Baskaran: I have not tried their OS library. But they demoed their proprietary product to me. I don't know their performance benchmark. But it was very fast. Here is the link: https://www.segmind.com/
[2023-05-12, 12:29:05] Kishore GenAI: You can try changing solvers. I think DDPM is one of the fastest requiring 15 to 20 steps.
[2023-05-12, 12:29:16] Kishore GenAI: Gives great results as well
[2023-05-12, 12:32:10] Kishore GenAI: And i realized that upscalers are the best for generating higher resolution images. It also fits correctly with workflow and enables faster generation. Users typically don't want to wait a long time for high res images if they feel it will not be worth it. Saving the generation parameters and getting output as latents and sending it to upscalers is the process I use now.
[2023-05-12, 12:34:40] Kishore GenAI: I was able to get one A100 from banana dev and calculated the iters per seconds from what I assume is the best for runway ml stable diffusion inpainting model with Multistep DPM solver.  This is A100 GPU
These were the numbers in case anyone wants
7.14it/s    512 x 512 
 5.27it/s 768 x 512
 2.66it/s  768 x 768
1.07it/s    1024 x 1024 

This is from Jan 18th 2023. No other optimizations were included. Just the base model and Multistep DPM solver
[2023-05-12, 12:43:20] Kishore GenAI: I have some thoughts regarding how video generation might come. I feel it will come from 3D scenes to video. There was an HF blog shared on the state of video and problems with it. My understanding is that it would be easier to generate 3D scene and then fix the camera angle and light sources. Then start the system, with few controls and record it from one angle or the other. 

Why I feel this way is because a lot of animators have worked in gaming studio's and design to generate very realistic visuals, and given that even if we do end up getting video generation, it would make sense that it would be similar to controlnet which exerts massive amount of control over the generation process. 

There are already models which work on 3D meshes, aka, interaction with objects which are generated in a room, holding of objects, dance movements and its interaction with clothes, interaction between humans and other objects. Feel like this workflow for 3D scene creation to video scene creation would be my current guess. 

Would appreciate any views in this.

[2023-05-12, 18:28:38] Vignesh Baskaran: This makes sense
[2023-05-12, 20:37:33] Hasan Tech Art: 1. The hallucinations are there but it just comes out as a trippy sound so it sounds look as bad as the text models. They are working on having more control though.

2. They do have some internal versions with seed control like capabilities not available publicly yet. 

3. They have the voice cloning and audio only prompts capabilities just not exposed in bark, they don’t want to be accountable for the crimes. They are thinking about a responsible way to release it. 

They are working with sound director of dune to train on environmental sounds and objects breaking etc. also talking with music production software companies like Ableton. 

He said I’ll be on the access list as soon as possible so 🤞

[2023-05-13, 12:43:30] Vamshi: Having a diffusion model configurable as an added step in a post process volume would be a great start in this direction
[2023-05-13, 12:44:59] Vamshi: I haven’t found any sufficient resources for matching lighting and camera angles, it does feel like adding it directly as a plugin in the post process volume would be the right place in the pipeline
[2023-05-13, 13:03:53] Vamshi: @919500192175 curious to know if you’re working in this area
[2023-05-13, 13:28:14] Kishore GenAI: I am not working in this area as of yet. However, I keep coming across projects and papers which are useful to integrate in a workflow. For lighting and shadows, isn't some sort of ray tracing algo useful. Clipdrop already has one for images, and given that game studios need the shadowx to change often, (night time vs day time, vs afternoon) so my understanding is that it should be present.
[2023-05-13, 13:28:33] Kishore GenAI: I assume it is ray tracing, i havent done any background work in it yet

[2023-05-13, 16:38:26] Vamshi: Unreal community, for example, has been relatively slow in integrating support for models. There’s definitely attempts, but it feels uncharacteristically slow from the community.

Generally they are the early adopters.

[2023-05-15, 20:58:27] Harsh Koo: With DB, to create a decent and even high quality image requires some really good prompt engineering chops. 

I used diffusiondb to find lots of examples and prompthero and prompthunt websites helped. 

With ref only CN, I could take a decent image and then provide simple prompts to get a good output. 

Needs testing.
[2023-05-15, 20:58:35] Kishore GenAI: It provides the exact same output as the webui as well.
[2023-05-15, 20:59:21] Kishore GenAI: Controlnet only recently became a supported pipeline. However, it is nowhere close to the implementation possible in A1111
[2023-05-15, 20:59:48] Kishore GenAI: Would highly suggested to use A1111 and see what's working and then start API calls to it. Very versatile, easy to test playground as well.

[2023-05-15, 21:03:58] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I was on g5.xl for some time then had to move to g5.2xl.
[2023-05-15, 21:03:59] Kishore GenAI: 16GB VRAM is more than sufficient.
[2023-05-15, 21:04:14] Amogh V: Haven’t tried, but someone recommended kaggle notebook
[2023-05-15, 21:04:25] Kishore GenAI: Instance type
g4dn.xlarge
[2023-05-15, 21:05:21] Amogh V: They give storage also so you can save custom checkpoints, Lora embedding files etc. with Colab you had attach Google drive
[2023-05-15, 21:05:34] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Got it. Yeah, that should also work unless they block gradio. I tried running vscode web + ngrok there. They terminated my session. Haven't tried running automatic1111 yet.
[2023-05-15, 21:05:39] Kishore GenAI: @919619491715 @917407651462 , did you guys face any issues with RAM consumption in controlnet?  https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet/issues/990
[2023-05-15, 21:05:40] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Thanks Kishore!!
[2023-05-15, 21:06:00] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Yes a lot 😅
[2023-05-15, 21:06:09] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: We moved out of Automatic for production.
[2023-05-15, 21:06:19] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: We are using diffusers self written mega pipeline.
[2023-05-15, 21:06:21] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Thanks! Will check EC2 as well.
[2023-05-15, 21:07:04] Kishore GenAI: I use cloud watch and then kill the program when it crosses 80% and then restart it.
[2023-05-15, 21:07:10] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Hahahah.
[2023-05-15, 21:07:29] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I remember someone discussing this internally too.
[2023-05-15, 21:07:43] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: But I was like hackathon nai hai :P
[2023-05-15, 21:08:34] Kishore GenAI: how did you go about this? using the conversion script for controlnet to diffusers, and then hacking together a img2img and inpaint pipeline was very difficult
[2023-05-15, 21:08:58] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: @919585267670 should probably give a session on this 😅
[2023-05-15, 21:09:02] Kishore GenAI: This was even before controlnet was a supported pipeline
[2023-05-15, 21:09:33] Kishore GenAI: I would attend, even virtually
[2023-05-15, 21:09:35] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: It was a weeklong project he took. 😅
[2023-05-15, 21:10:01] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: We had many parallel pipelines before that but we just couldnt scale with that.
[2023-05-15, 21:10:19] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Now 1 pipeline to rule them all with controlnet, lora, multiple models.
[2023-05-15, 21:10:44] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I think he just went deep into each pipelines codebase and then wrote from scratch.
[2023-05-15, 21:11:09] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: We needed that flexibility anyway to be able to have full control over generation.
[2023-05-15, 21:11:30] Kishore GenAI: Makes sense. I did that in Feb, but then they did breaking changes.
[2023-05-15, 21:13:38] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: ^true. Will tell you when it breaks for us. :P

[2023-05-16, 20:15:04] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Hi. Has anyone here tried Shap-E?
[2023-05-16, 20:16:42] Shimanta Generative AI: I tinkered with it a bit.
Text to 3D was good enough but image to 3D was below average quality.
[2023-05-16, 20:17:35] Shimanta Generative AI: Also I think text to 3D won’t perform well with relatively uncommon stuff, might need to finetune the model for better outputs
[2023-05-16, 20:18:15] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Are there any models in the same league that are better? I'm looking specifically for Text to 3d with complex inputs
[2023-05-16, 20:19:29] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Like inputs with multiple objects inside another object. That kind of hting.
[2023-05-16, 20:34:04] Shimanta Generative AI: Didn’t find any other similar models, let alone better.
Also realised that finetuning it is not possible yet since they haven’t released the dataset.
The main bottleneck is in generating a good point cloud, after which 3D becomes easy.
They only did some post processing on their earlier point-e model with more 3D assets for shap-e, hence the constraints
[2023-05-16, 20:57:43] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Just out of curiosity why can’t the principles of 2D images (like the ones from stable diffusion) be extrapolated to 3D (apologies in advance if it is too dumb a question)
[2023-05-16, 21:01:35] Divya Tak: I think a part of it must be the fact that 2d images are scalar while 3d is vector?
[2023-05-16, 21:08:56] Ambika Computational Mama: Forgot you are a physics 👑
[2023-05-16, 21:13:30] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: No question is dumb here. 😅

So the way diffusion models figure what to fill in a pixel (technically incorrect since it figures in latent space) is by seeing a shit ton of images and then being able to predict that OK so this is a finger, likely the pixel nearby is also a finger because I’ve seen it so many times. 

For 3d, the abundance of labelled detailed point clouds are far far lower so if we go by diffusion approach, there isn’t enough information to learn from.
[2023-05-16, 21:15:49] ~ Srinath Nair: But I think if similar context images can be generated, then they can be stitched to form atleast a 360 degree image if not 3D. That would be pretty cool as well.
[2023-05-16, 21:16:23] ~ Srinath Nair: Like generating a 360 degree room
[2023-05-16, 21:16:44] Divya Tak: Hmmm, but you can't make a 3d model right
[2023-05-16, 21:17:00] Divya Tak: Because how'd you go about seperating lighting in that context
[2023-05-16, 21:18:09] Ambika Computational Mama: Thanks for this. Well explained
[2023-05-16, 21:26:22] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: If you mean a Google 360 kind image? That’s pure stitching no? Just keep out painting correctly and should solve that? 😅
[2023-05-16, 21:27:10] ~ Srinath Nair: Eactly
[2023-05-16, 21:27:18] ~ Srinath Nair: But idt anyone's done that?
[2023-05-16, 21:29:14] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Yea lighting and all make 3d fairly complex unless we go very point cloud/mesh based generation.
[2023-05-16, 21:30:51] Shimanta Generative AI: 360deg diffusion LoRA models are present already. Recently saw a video where a person did this with a model from civitai and his automattic ui setup, plus some more extensions
Even created a blender addon to generate the 3d space from the generated image
Let me see if I can find it
[2023-05-16, 21:31:44] ~ Srinath Nair: Wow, please do. Might want to play around with it!
[2023-05-16, 21:41:33] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Yes please share link?

"Isn't RL for diffusion models quite computationally expensive, since each update requires running the entire reverse process? Seems unlikely to me that they are doing RLHF... They could be doing something else to utilize the human feedback though"

Creating legible text in SD models. Extremely Interesting paper. State problems present in DF text generation (does mostly all caps). Also showcases that SD models in itself without retraining can produce legible text using this method. The model isn't released, but it takes inspiration from Controlnet.

[2023-06-02, 10:34:41] Harsh Koo: Any tips/resources on how to write prompts for Dreambooth models. 

I have a bunch of SD fine-tuned on some individuals and want to figure out prompts so I can generate avatars (like profilepicture.ai). 

I've used prompthero and other sites like prompthunt but want to find a resource that could furnish a large and diverse collection.
[2023-06-02, 10:36:45] Nirant K: cc @919611930033 worked quite a bit on Dreambooth before it got superceded by LoRA
[2023-06-02, 10:38:33] Harsh Koo: Just to clarify, I can do SD fine-tuning and there are companies doing this as a service like astria. 

I'm looking for the prompts
[2023-06-02, 10:39:47] ~ prthamesh: One approach if you don’t want to write detailed prompts is to use textual inversion embeddings and loras that are fine tuned specifically for styles. You can mix and match them with a simple prompt
[2023-06-02, 10:40:49] Harsh Koo: Thanks @918451007453
Any resources you can recommend for this?
[2023-06-02, 10:41:14] Harsh Koo: And I'm assuming for some custom style, I may have to train SD for it specifically.
[2023-06-02, 10:41:39] Harsh Koo: Like e.g., sanjay leela bansali movies - style.
[2023-06-02, 10:41:40] ~ prthamesh: There’s a bunch of these styles on civitai
[2023-06-02, 10:42:04] ~ prthamesh: Yeah this you might need to train yourself
[2023-06-02, 10:42:06] Nirant K: Civitai LoRA are quite good!
[2023-06-02, 10:42:17] Nirant K: LoRA this. Not Dreambooth.

[2023-06-02, 10:43:16] ~ prthamesh: Might be a video 3-4 months back where he did the Lora and textual inversion mix n match
[2023-06-02, 10:44:10] ~ prthamesh: For quick check, replicate has a Lora training script (written by CloneOfSimo, og author of the repo) on replicate
[2023-06-02, 10:53:26] ~ Nayana🙂: ‎~ Nayana🙂 joined from the community
[2023-06-02, 11:21:46] ~ Prajwal: +1, LoRA works really well with a smaller dataset to train on too, plus it's really good at adapting to styles and producing good quality outputs for the styles it's been trained on.
[2023-06-02, 11:57:49] Amogh V: If your Dreambooth is fine tuned on a v1.5 base model then the prompting is really no different. Plus with 1.5 the same prompt can give you the same stylized effect across several dreambooth fine tuned models. With 2.1 on the other hand it's very different. Prompt used for one almost never works for another.
[2023-06-02, 12:02:49] Amogh V: You can go to Lexica or Playground and pick up the prompt for any image that you like which was created with a 1.5 model and in my experience that should work even for a dreambooth finetune

First off, Sincerest apologies that this group contributed to that. 

*Actions*: 

1. I've removed the specific spammer from the group & community. I am choosing to not remove any other folks associated with these orgs till I hear from them.

2. I've informed both orgs. They're looking at this internally. I trust them to resolve this and constitute changes to prevent this in future. 

I am not making any short term changes to the admission policy for the group for now. Don't want to punish the many for the errors of few 🙏

If you feel differently about this, please inform me

[2023-06-02, 13:13:16] Shashank Generative AI Group: this is the main downside of whatsapp. on discord, spam would be contained within discord.

to be clear, not saying we should switch (even tho I'd prefer discord personally). saw the recent mini-debate in the other group 😅. trade-offs...
[2023-06-02, 13:14:59] Shashank Generative AI Group: check out dreambooth, StableDiffusion subreddits. 

especially the "workflows included" flair. very underrated. lots of good stuff, prompts.

or just google "dreambooth prompts for avatars site:reddit.com". you'll get all the good stuff.

looking for platforms to create deepfake in 4K - or atleast HD quality - for a film project. any suggestions ?
[2023-06-02, 16:32:57] Nirant K: cc @917407651462 @919049214140 @919008639111 @919953076613 — do we've a consistent way of thinking about deepfakes?

Given the dangers with that specific technology, should we discourage it or at least constantly remind of those? 

I don't have strong convictions on this, will let you decide as mods
[2023-06-02, 16:33:59] Divya Tak: 😅😅
[2023-06-02, 16:34:18] Divya Tak: That was my first thought, that are we just allowing deepfakes to be happily created in 4k
[2023-06-02, 16:34:25] Divya Tak: And openly supporting that
[2023-06-02, 16:34:36] Divya Tak: But i could be having a very conservative view on this

[2023-06-02, 16:35:31] ~ Upasana Switch: totally agree on the dangers of deepfakes
it petrifies me frankly.

this question is in context of a fiction film meant to be seen as deepfake and the dangers of it
[2023-06-02, 16:36:47] ~ Upasana Switch: yup - my worry as well... hence the question - glad to open a can of worms in this forum where there these dangers are acknowledged and open for discussion
[2023-06-02, 16:39:49] ~ Upasana Switch: < will be happy to know if such a platform doesn't exist as well... and will revert to the VFX team that they will need to create it - since it is very key to the narrative --- will share more about the film once i can...>
[2023-06-02, 16:41:56] Ambika Computational Mama: I think there still a while for such a production ready tool - if you see a project claiming to do so it is probably not a full truth!

[2023-06-02, 17:31:41] ~ Upasana Switch: yes from me
[2023-06-02, 17:40:59] Hasan Tech Art: As in having multiple fictional voices that a performer can use while singing live. It takes a whole lot of time to make samples in different voices right now. Also cloning someone specific (Arijit Singh, Lata Mangeshkar etc) is definitely not good. There are online synthetic voices which are not cloned from a specific person with very liberal licensing that can be used. I don’t see a problem with that use case, no more than auto tune.
[2023-06-02, 17:46:09] ~ Ashutosh Kumar: http://translateaudio.com some good work on voice translation here
[2023-06-02, 18:52:00] Amir Nagri: With controlnet+lora, older dreambooth and prompt engineering is not needed

So even if you want to generate specific styles or background check out control net

[2023-06-02, 20:01:41] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Or reference only also works to some extent for style.
[2023-06-02, 20:02:30] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: "reference only" is a controlnet.
[2023-06-02, 21:54:09] Amogh V: Both reference-only and t2i style adapters are available as controlnet options in Automatic. For t2i_adapter_style model choose t2ia_style_clipvision as the preprocessor. reference_only is selected from the preprocessor drop-down and no model is required to be selected

[2023-06-04, 11:39:56] Harsh Koo: One idea Id like your inputs on is the following;
Context;
Clipdrop has these style presets it applies to a prompt for SD. 

If one used LoRA (eg https://replicate.com/blog/lora-faster-fine-tuning-of-stable-diffusion) to fine-tune on styles say;
- Ravi Verma art
- Mughal miniatures
- Bandhni/Bandhej
- Sanjay Leela movie sets 

The above styles could be used as uniquely Indian presets in a Clipdrop like setting? 

Is this directionally a feasible idea?

[2023-06-07, 11:35:53] Harsh Koo: I have been looking for a SD API provider. 

Have spoken to clipdrop (acquired by stability) 

Stability themselves have API. 

And spoke to the CTO of tryleap.ai - Ibrahim. 

Of all my conversations Ibrahim was the most passionate and is building features at breakneck speed and is a team of 4.

Said he used GPT-4 for a lot of his thinking and dev process. 

He is looking for usecases to build into his API stack. 

Also spoke to stablediffusionapi.com guys who have a basic service (all you can eat for a fixed cost for a GPU instance kind of thing). 

Only stability provides a style preset that one can use in API. 

Others all require to send derailed prompt. 

Just sharing here of anyone has any inputs, experience etc.
[2023-06-07, 11:38:30] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: I have used stablediffusionapi.com for a POC that i was building had pretty good results. Not much latency with the api either
[2023-06-07, 11:40:39] Harsh Koo: This is good to know.
[2023-06-07, 11:40:52] Harsh Koo: They don't provide usage based pricing which is what I'm looking for atm.
[2023-06-07, 11:41:59] Saurabh Qblocks: Try https://monsterapi.ai/
Usage based pricing
[2023-06-07, 11:42:27] Amogh V: I used Replicate for the sticker project. Trained and hosted our dreambooth model on it
[2023-06-07, 11:47:50] Kishore GenAI: Any reason on choosing an API provider, given that there are open source models which can be deployed as and when needed? Given the different frameworks which exist, do you not feel limited by the lack of flexibility for you to change the image gen workflow?
[2023-06-07, 11:49:44] Harsh Koo: My thinking is that if I know how to run the tech, in this case SD and fine-tuning etc., then I don't mind using an API provider to offload the infra burden. 

Also, for me to build a usage based infra is more effort and at most with my b/w I can deploy warm GPU which will add to my cost as I experiment with these tools.
[2023-06-07, 11:49:47] Gaurav MonsterAPI Qblocks: Would love to chat with you to understand the use case better. Are style presets the key for decision maker or something else like cost or latency at scale?
We at monsterapi.ai have come up with scalable rest APIs for SD and many more generative AI models which run on our low cost decentralised GPU cloud. Thus a completely optimised pipeline.
[2023-06-07, 11:50:52] Harsh Koo: will DM.

[2023-06-07, 14:40:13] Sudharshan GenAI: Hey folks
[2023-06-07, 14:40:39] Sudharshan GenAI: How are you generating masks for inpainting in auto1111?

The brush is not precise
[2023-06-07, 14:47:46] Digvijay GenAI Group: Pypi - rembg
[2023-06-07, 15:21:42] Amogh V: It works for simple stuff. Precise masks exactly according to the subject’s lines actually give me bad results. Some padding is always required. So if I want a precise mask with some padding I create one in another layer on photoshop or photopea and use the inpaint upload feature where you can upload the image and the mask separately.
[2023-06-07, 15:22:52] Amogh V: That’s why in dashtoon studio we implemented a mask that’s translucent that lets you see the underlying image and we also enabled zooming in and out of specific areas in the image.
[2023-06-07, 15:25:46] Ambika Computational Mama: Is dashtoon on the App Store now or still via test flight? Would like to try again.
[2023-06-07, 15:29:31] Sudharshan GenAI: Nice!
[2023-06-07, 15:30:06] Amogh V: The AI powered creator tool is a web app now not mobile
[2023-06-07, 15:30:18] Sudharshan GenAI: Got it, I'm doing this. Where are you running auto?

auto1111 on runpod isn't working for this feature
[2023-06-07, 15:36:59] Amogh V: Our own deployment
[2023-06-07, 15:38:58] Kishore GenAI: Rembg extension in A1111. https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui-rembg.  Try with the isnet-general-use, it seems to be good. 

You can also look into SAM: https://github.com/continue-revolution/sd-webui-segment-anything

There is a new model called SAM-HQ, which will release in 2 weeks. you can look into that as well. (https://github.com/SysCV/sam-hq). Dont know the webui extension for it. Should be workable with these extension itself.

I have a three step process for masking in my product. The first step is using rembg. Post that if the algo doesn't identify correctly, I ask for them to try again ( we then get results with different models). They can then choose the best mask and then use a brush to get very precise image. 

The second step is optional, and rembg, is pretty good at masking.
[2023-06-07, 15:43:29] Sudharshan GenAI: Thanks!
[2023-06-07, 15:44:17] Kishore GenAI: @919619491715 your own deployment of A1111 or own deployment of models using HF diffusers?

[2023-06-07, 15:46:28] Kishore GenAI: @919940474056 you can  try looking into this: https://cloud.lambdalabs.com/demos/camenduru/stable-diffusion-webui . Havent worked with it and do not know how it works. Came across this a couple of weeks ago.
[2023-06-07, 15:56:58] Sudharshan GenAI: Okay figured it out - simple issue
[2023-06-07, 15:57:02] Sudharshan GenAI: Got it working on runpod
[2023-06-07, 15:57:11] Sudharshan GenAI: Thanks will check anyways
[2023-06-07, 15:57:43] Amogh V: Both!
[2023-06-07, 16:03:56] ~ Pranshul Chandhok: Which infra are you using? How's queuing being handled?
[2023-06-07, 16:09:32] Kishore GenAI: you can also try  https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic. Diffusers team is actively trying to get diffusers to work with this fork.  Example: This is one of the core team members of HF:  https://github.com/vladmandic/automatic/pull/1336
[2023-06-07, 16:10:22] Kishore GenAI: Can you explain what you mean by queueing here? Are you using API calls to A111 or the webui?
[2023-06-07, 16:12:19] ~ Pranshul Chandhok: Yes a simple service to kick off generation on basis of user inputs.
[2023-06-07, 16:17:42] Kishore GenAI: I am not doing this from A1111, cause I also need to store the data. this is a simple way and I do not know whether this is robust or not, but this works:
1. Create a generationItem and a generationListModel (item,list)
2. Have three states in item, not started, failed, completed. and initialise it with not started 
3. Add it to the list, with created_at field.
4. Run a script to consistently parse the list to make the API request to select items which are not started, and update the item when response is received  as completed.
[2023-06-07, 16:18:51] Kishore GenAI: Essentially, the queuing logic happens at your end,and you send requests only when the response is received .
[2023-06-07, 16:23:30] ~ Pranshul Chandhok: This could work but asking the group if someone has deployed the same in a better way and what infra they are using?
[2023-06-07, 16:27:57] Sudharshan GenAI: Wow this is great, a very spec'd out version of auto. Saves time in installing things. Even better than rundiffusion. 

Hopefully everything works
[2023-06-07, 17:20:50] Vamshi: Anyone here successfully use any workflow to go from a
Stable Diffusion or mid journey character to a fully rigged metahuman ? 
I’m looking specifically for unreal engine, but happy to work from anything close.
[2023-06-07, 17:22:17] Vamshi: Possibly asked this here previously, I’m guessing no one going down this road - or it doesn’t work.
Is it possible to generate input images for an app like reality capture, using control net ?
[2023-06-07, 17:22:27] Divya Tak: I think while @919619491715 or @917407651462  can tell more, dashtoon is building characters in SD
[2023-06-07, 17:22:40] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: 3D is still hard :(
[2023-06-07, 17:22:55] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Like I do have an idea to train controlnet on metahuman rigs
[2023-06-07, 17:23:00] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: But then I dont have a reason to yet :P
[2023-06-07, 17:23:28] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Playing more around facial rigs though.
[2023-06-07, 17:23:30] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: For expressions.
[2023-06-07, 17:23:52] Vamshi: Ok 🙂
[2023-06-07, 17:24:13] Vamshi: Specifically looking for Michael Jackson for a project right now
[2023-06-07, 17:24:14] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Also, metahuman is proprietary
[2023-06-07, 17:24:23] Vamshi: Non commercial
[2023-06-07, 17:24:25] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: so cant get a rig of it outside unreal either
[2023-06-07, 17:24:35] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Or can we? 🤔
[2023-06-07, 17:24:46] Vamshi: Not looking for a fully productised workflow
[2023-06-07, 17:24:50] Vamshi: Willing to hack it together
[2023-06-07, 17:25:21] Vamshi: It’s for motion capture based puppeteering of the character
[2023-06-07, 17:25:34] Vamshi: Of course deep motion would be nice, but one step at a time
[2023-06-07, 17:26:00] Vamshi: I couldn’t find a decent metahuman michael Jackson
[2023-06-07, 17:26:11] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Do you mean converting human video to character video type thing?
[2023-06-07, 17:26:13] ~ Arjun Narain: Which platform do you folks recommend for running models online? Paperspace or Colab? Any other recommendations?
[2023-06-07, 17:27:28] Nirant K: Too broad a question, from serverless GPUs to just tinkering. What are you looking to do?
[2023-06-07, 17:29:16] Vamshi: Yeah, there’s already a  standard workflow for re-targeting both offline animation and live motion capture data to metahumans. I’m willing to just use that to begin with, there’s already lots of novelty there in the final content.

The next step would be extract animation data from a video using something like deepmotion , but that’s for later.
[2023-06-07, 17:29:46] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: That doesnt need a controlnet no?
[2023-06-07, 17:30:05] Vamshi: Ok here was my super half baked idea
‎[2023-06-07, 17:30:36] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: ‎GIF omitted
[2023-06-07, 17:30:39] Vamshi: I thought I could use control net to generate all the poses required by an app that generates the mesh like reality capture
[2023-06-07, 17:31:20] Vamshi: Then generate the mesh from there
[2023-06-07, 17:31:38] Vamshi: And then there’s a plugin that does mesh to metahuman
[2023-06-07, 17:32:48] Vamshi: I saw a video on this channel PromptMuse, intend to follow along next, but I was testing the waters to on this chat to see if it’s worth the trouble
[2023-06-07, 17:33:48] Vamshi: But that’s a different approach than trying to generate inputs for a photogrammetry app from controlnet
[2023-06-07, 17:34:08] Vamshi: I don’t even know if I’m climbing up the wrong tree here 😄
[2023-06-07, 17:34:25] Vamshi: There’s one more approach which is super super tedious
[2023-06-07, 17:34:49] Vamshi: Which is to use controlnet to generate the entire animation against a green screen
[2023-06-07, 17:35:13] Vamshi: And then match the camera motion in unreal engine and composite it manually
[2023-06-07, 17:35:57] Vamshi: But I feel like things could be more interesting going down the path of the metahuman
[2023-06-07, 17:36:06] Vamshi: It gets into a much more manageable workflow
[2023-06-07, 17:37:01] Vamshi: No cookie yet
[2023-06-07, 17:38:52] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: So controlnet for a mesh isnt solved yet from what I know.
[2023-06-07, 17:39:31] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Unless 2d controlnet to mesh is possible with some 3d tool.
[2023-06-07, 17:39:38] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I dont have enough depth on 3d things 😅
[2023-06-07, 17:39:44] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: ^pun intended.
[2023-06-07, 17:39:49] Vamshi: 😄
[2023-06-07, 17:40:00] Vamshi: Im sure you’ve tried enough to have ideas

[2023-06-07, 17:41:30] ~ Arjun Narain: Just tinkering for now maybe?
[2023-06-07, 17:41:48] Vamshi: Might give you a better idea of how hacky is ok. Basically I’m ok to work around all limitations. 

Novelty is the only goal …
[2023-06-07, 17:42:10] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Ah but this is otherway round no?
[2023-06-07, 17:42:47] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: This is from 2D image gen to 3D with some facebuilder thing.
[2023-06-07, 17:42:57] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: That is easier than controlling a character in 3d with controlnet no?

[2023-06-07, 20:46:05] Vamshi: Don’t need a 3D control net
[2023-06-07, 20:52:48] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Ah that seems straightforward no?
[2023-06-07, 20:52:53] Vamshi: Let me summarise with fewest assumptions-

1. Use Gen AI to conceptualise a real or fictional character
2. Convert to 3D mesh 
3. Convert to rigged metahuman
4. Retarget fbx animations or live mocap data
[2023-06-07, 20:53:00] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: People are using 2d controlnet to 3d rigs in blender already
[2023-06-07, 20:53:44] Vamshi: Same as that promptmuse workflow?
[2023-06-07, 20:53:50] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Yea.
[2023-06-07, 20:53:56] Vamshi: Any howto you recommend following ?
[2023-06-07, 20:53:57] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I have seen with maya also.
[2023-06-07, 20:54:38] Vamshi: Great! Just to recap, this is for the same AI vocalist use case I mentioned before
[2023-06-07, 20:55:28] Vamshi: Wit some of those even just the D-ID based thing with no 3D is a nice start
[2023-06-07, 20:56:10] Vamshi: But for some of them the real metahuman with animation is nice to have
[2023-06-07, 20:57:26] Vamshi: *is better
[2023-06-07, 21:08:13] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: btw https://twitter.com/TheRundownAI/status/1666318396303212550
looks like this is what I was thinking of doing but 🤷‍♂️
[2023-06-07, 21:10:26] Shimanta Generative AI: Saw this today on LinkedIn. Was curious if it’s similar to how 2D avatars are created, say like those BoredApe NFTs. A combination of all possible assets, but directed by prompts. Would you be able to throw some light on it?
[2023-06-07, 21:37:31] Vamshi: Ok here I was willing to make do with a hacky workflow and this is already becoming a monthly subscription ?
[2023-06-07, 21:38:38] Vamshi: I’m guessing there would be tools focused on characters for specific use cases- maybe there’s plenty of space for competition ?

[2023-06-08, 19:05:54] ~ Shaurya Gupta: Hey folks, want to gain your opinion on this, 
Generally I've heard that LoRA is best for style fine-tuning but  with training I've found it almost never learned the style rather just gives distorted outputs for the given prompt in most cases. (Trying the same thing on objects give me good results, using SD1.5) 

But the same on Dreambooth learns the style good (not very close to original but decent) 
I'm using HuggingFace's scripts for both LoRA and DreamBooth, 

Any insights if anyone has faced the same, or is it just cause of HF? cause the models on civit are too good using just lora or dreambooth  (I believe they are using AUTOMATIC1111's implementation to gain the same, correct me if wrong 😅)
[2023-06-08, 19:11:56] ~ Sabbih: For style LoRA quality of selected data and generated captions matter a lot. For training we have the following options:

1. Kohya - Has a GUI and gets decent results. A lot of the civit LoRAs use this.
2. Clonefosimo - also pretty straightforward to use and has some face specific augmentations 
3. Huggingface - I have personally observed that option 1 and 2 produced better results than this. Given that we fix the data and captions and use default params in all approaches.
[2023-06-08, 19:12:29] Gaurav MonsterAPI Qblocks: I've faced the same. With lora, it depends a lot on the parameters I think and also on the number of images. It needs 15-20 images to get a good outcome as per my experience.
[2023-06-08, 19:13:33] Gaurav MonsterAPI Qblocks: We recently added automatic1111 as a ready to use option on q blocks. Not sure if it can help in your workflow or experimentation.

Also the SAM-HQ is out. It is present in this extension: https://github.com/continue-revolution/sd-webui-segment-anything. This you can use in A1111 webui.
[2023-06-15, 11:28:59] Kishore GenAI: Regarding masking, there should be more papers and code out there. I haven't gone through it a lot recently, but the one which I was looking for is already added in rembg (IS-Net model) looking forward to know what you feel works the best as per your experiments. My understanding is that SAM-HQ is better than SAM. So maybe you can try that first incase you were using SAM.

[2023-06-18, 11:51:20] Nirant K: Perhaps
[2023-06-18, 11:51:44] Rounak Datta Hackathon Winner: What I wondering - StableDiffusion generates realistic images, but they are not actionable upon. But if you're able to represent a scene as a code (albeit simple, not as complex, realistic as SD), you can potentially animate the scene and what not
[2023-06-18, 12:40:00] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: I think AnimatedDrawings project by Meta comes pretty close to what you’re describing 

The exact use case matches too

You can upload any stick figure or cartoon drawing and upload a reference video 

You will get an animated output which follows the reference video

[2023-06-20, 17:22:57] Sharwon Pius: [help required] 
Folks working on stable diffusion, have you faced inconsistencies in image quality (vanilla install automatic 1111, or update) ? I searched for quite a bit, found incongruent answers.  Example, https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/issues/10223 . 
Things I tried, and not working.
1. Fresh clone install.
1a. Installed from prev stable tags (git).
2. Fresh clone install + optimizations (medram, xformers ....)
3. Saved intermediate images (https://github.com/AlUlkesh/sd_save_intermediate_images). No good quality images found.
4. valmandic's automatic.
5. deleted any related caching (pip).

For some reason, comfy ui (amazing workflow, btw) is the only one that gave expected default quality.  Please check the github link, for what I mean by quality degradation.

I faced this problem, while experimenting different optimizations for a stable video workflow. But, given that a fresh install should have worked. So, I'm assuming it is a caching or a driver issue.
[2023-06-20, 17:25:48] Amogh V: What do you mean by inconsistencies in image quality and default quality? Those are very broad terms
[2023-06-20, 17:26:26] Sharwon Pius: can you please check this out. https://github.com/AUTOMATIC1111/stable-diffusion-webui/issues/10223

‎[2023-06-20, 17:27:19] Sharwon Pius: ‎image omitted
[2023-06-20, 18:24:56] Amogh V: I haven't used Automatic extensively in a while since shifting to our own internal platform. But have you tried running the old commit that works on your home PC in the Last Ben notebook? Back when I used Colab to access Automatic I also ran into some random unexplainable issue and this fixed it for me
[2023-06-20, 18:25:58] Amogh V: My guess is use the same commit where you know 100% that it works until some update is shipped. Such issues are common with Automatic!
[2023-06-20, 18:27:08] Amogh V: Also I assume you've checked that all your other params including checkpoint, prompt, steps etc are the same
[2023-06-20, 18:28:18] Sharwon Pius: I didn't know automatic was unstable, assuming with the stars and commits.
[2023-06-20, 18:29:18] Vignesh Baskaran: Its extremely unstable. My suggestion would be once you figure out the recipe you like, please re-write it using Diffusers. Of course please take inspiration from A1111 codebase
[2023-06-20, 18:34:45] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Stability isn’t what they are focusing or optimising on. It’s pure speed of innovation POCs.
[2023-06-20, 18:34:46] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Stars are to value the amazing speed and innovations ppl are doing with it 😅
[2023-06-20, 18:34:47] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Comfy or invoke are trying more for stability but I feel they are so slow that they are not usable in today’s world for pocs.
[2023-06-20, 18:36:49] Sharwon Pius: Thanks for the responses. 
I have to automate ebsynth for my workflow. Do you have any resources for transitioning from automatic to diffusers. I heard, loras and lycoris aren't integrated well.
[2023-06-20, 18:36:52] Amogh V: Try rundiffusion
[2023-06-20, 18:38:17] Amogh V: transitioning from automatic to diffusers……

Solving this will be a great service to humanity.
[2023-06-20, 18:38:40] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: What is the flow you want?
[2023-06-20, 18:39:42] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Hugging face was building a ui for diffusers too, haven’t seen it since some time. Anyone saw it?
[2023-06-20, 18:43:15] Sharwon Pius: Get video. 
Extract key frames.
Use control net/addons to get a subspace which Im looking for.
Interpolate the style for non keyframes (ebsynth).
Use flow masking to smooth things out.
Stich back video.

(V1)
[2023-06-20, 18:46:05] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: And how often/ how many you want to do in a day types?
[2023-06-20, 18:47:50] Sharwon Pius: It is a personal project. I would like to have at least 20 generations in a day, validate the video consistency and style.
[2023-06-20, 18:49:17] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: That’s not a lot 😅

Rundiffusion should work no?
[2023-06-20, 18:50:20] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I feel Anything that isn’t automatic111 Will slow experiments down and if your throughput needs aren’t a external product like, any managed automatic111 is great 😅
[2023-06-20, 18:51:13] Sharwon Pius: Working with ebsynth is a pain, btw.
[2023-06-20, 18:51:45] Sharwon Pius: IlI try it out.

[2023-06-20, 18:54:15] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Yea I’ve tried too 😅
[2023-06-20, 18:55:03] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I’m not a great eye for art of this form but don’t the beats and movements look a little off? 🙊
[2023-06-20, 18:55:48] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: So this is human video too controlnet to generated images to ebsynth with background audio right?
[2023-06-20, 18:56:11] Sharwon Pius: Yes
[2023-06-20, 18:56:33] Sharwon Pius: My recoding amp was noise, so the audio is a bit off.
[2023-06-20, 18:56:42] Sharwon Pius: XD
[2023-06-20, 18:58:52] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Pretty cool though. Try Dashtoon if you want. I guarantee more stability but not sure if you’ll get this style yet.
[2023-06-20, 19:00:38] Sharwon Pius: I;m not an artist aswell, just putting it out there. I work primarly on monocular vision navigation. In the space of generative, I noticed getting consistency in videos is still an unsolved problem. Simple flow based filtering could help a lot. (ContorlNet for optical flow)
[2023-06-20, 19:01:16] Sharwon Pius: Cool. I'll check it out.
[2023-06-20, 19:02:42] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Ooo I used to do vision navigation too. Doesn’t ebsynth exactly do this?
[2023-06-20, 19:05:25] Sharwon Pius: Yes, I think so. But, I noticed if there is a significant change of information (dance videos) in between keyframes, it struggles at lot.
[2023-06-20, 19:07:20] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: True I see a lot of flickers. How are you solving it?
[2023-06-20, 19:09:03] Sharwon Pius: One way of solving it would be to give better input representations. So, I created point cloud vfx in unity and used that as an input. An example, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LmZYG0mQ_SY . It gave me decent results.
[2023-06-20, 19:10:30] Sharwon Pius: But, for videos in the wild. It is a harder problem. I also tried, generative human pose video from my kinect and use that an input. An example, https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sIyNBU0S9Ng
[2023-06-20, 19:11:52] Dev Aggarwal: Slick dance moves, I must say!
[2023-06-20, 19:15:52] Sharwon Pius: From my research, the sota for consistent videos (visual inference) is warp fusion. https://www.patreon.com/posts/71681839 . Not sure why its behind a paywall. If any folks are interested in making a opensource version, hit me up.
[2023-06-20, 19:18:38] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Input to controlnet?
[2023-06-20, 19:19:42] Dev Aggarwal: @917407651462 can you train a controlnet like an rnn, so that it takes both the reference pose, but also the previous output image to maintain temporal coherence?
[2023-06-20, 19:20:53] Sharwon Pius: It is just a screen recording. I haven't figured out how to save image and depth in unity yet. Any help would help me take next steps :)
[2023-06-20, 19:21:27] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I didn’t understand what this is doing from the page 😅

[2023-06-20, 19:24:10] Sharwon Pius: In my automatic 1111 workflow; depth, normal and pose are frequently used. I wanted to combine them, for faster validation. The closest thing I got to was, https://grail.cs.washington.edu/projects/dreampose/ . I had a very hard time replicating the results.
[2023-06-20, 19:24:47] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: By combine do you mean like a multi input controlnet? Coz layering you can always do no?
[2023-06-20, 19:25:51] Sharwon Pius: I think dense pose is a much better input that multi input control net. Cause each moving part will have its own influence.
[2023-06-20, 19:26:03] Sharwon Pius: than*
[2023-06-20, 19:29:31] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: That would mean a diff controlnet no?
[2023-06-20, 19:34:34] Sharwon Pius: I'm using control net vaguely, almost as a placeholder for image feature based prompting.
[2023-06-20, 19:35:30] Sharwon Pius: I'm not aware of the technical terms in this space, just started off with fastai V2.
[2023-06-20, 19:35:57] Sharwon Pius: Ill get back to you on this.
[2023-06-20, 19:38:02] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: What I mean is if the modality of input to controlnet needs to change so that the diffusion model works accordingly, it would need a new controlnet model to be trained.
[2023-06-20, 19:38:14] Sharwon Pius: Yes
[2023-06-20, 19:38:19] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: But I do see merit in a model that takes depth plus pose 🤔
[2023-06-20, 19:38:19] Sharwon Pius: A custom control net.
[2023-06-20, 19:38:36] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: But depth data usually isn’t that easily available
[2023-06-20, 19:38:59] Sharwon Pius: True that.
[2023-06-20, 19:39:17] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I’m sure someone will do this soon 😂
[2023-06-20, 19:42:26] ~ lirus: I have tried this. The results are super cherry picked. Tbh it doesn't really understand the flow of video.
[2023-06-20, 19:43:49] ~ lirus: There are definitely better ways to do novel view/pose synthesis. I was guess there would be some models that could do interpolation in videos.

[2023-06-20, 20:38:49] Sharwon Pius: Runwayml, makes the BG consistent, you can also see the generation is audio reactive. (My assumption, could be a complete coincidence).

[2023-06-20, 20:49:19] Sharwon Pius: The output looks like it has been cropped out from a green screen, and bg change. I think, he is not using control net depth preprocessor.
[2023-06-20, 20:50:38] Sharwon Pius: I feel control net can easily learn videos if we train them the right way.  A good starting point would be optical flow based control net.

I am good with prompt etc but I was a specific placement of a  component on final image .  Say I give a prompt description asking for a person of a certain age etc and I want to put a logo on his tee shirt or on handbag or on a flag . I am supplying that logo as  base / source image . Can it be done ?
[2023-06-22, 16:24:31] Aishwarya Goel Inferless 5s for 5G: This looks amazing!
[2023-06-22, 16:27:13] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: To my knowledge no. You have to try SD and put layers
[2023-06-22, 16:38:12] Azhan Mohammed Generative AI WhatsApp Group: You can first start with the logo, create an object (tshirt, handbag, or flag) with the said logo ( I would suggest stable diffusion for this step, as it works much better for these cases). Next step could be to use the generated image with another prompt to add the person.
I read this other conversation for using open ai logo, and someone shared this link where they used open ai logo: https://gooey.ai/ai-photo-editor/?run_id=jka2opiv&uid=BdKPkn4uZ1Ys0vXTnxNnyPyXixt1

Might help
[2023-06-22, 16:41:28] Sudhanshu Heda Entrepreneur First: Courtesy: Inferless
[2023-06-22, 16:44:19] Kishore GenAI: Use controlnet canny, and img2img. Take a shirt image and place the logo on top of it. the area where the logo exists, use controlnet canny and depth as inputs. It should be able to generate the image.
[2023-06-22, 16:44:57] Kishore GenAI: you can use inpaint also, if you want your shirt to not change in other areas.
[2023-06-22, 16:45:08] Kishore GenAI: Use A1111. Not diffusers.
[2023-06-22, 16:46:31] Kishore GenAI: Prompts are a bad user experience. Even if you learn prompts for model A, if it gets upgraded, your prompts become worthless. This happened to a lot of people when they shifted from sdV1.5 to Sdv2.0
[2023-06-22, 16:47:00] Kishore GenAI: I would highly recommend frameworks which take images as inputs. Controlnet is one of the best out there for this type of purpose.
[2023-06-22, 17:31:11] Amogh V: Not possible using midjourney. Certainly possible using controlnet and inpaint in Stable Diffusion. This is the workflow you need

[2023-06-22, 17:37:13] Kishore GenAI: In a demo, the customer wanted to add toothbrush to the right side of the image. This was pre-controlnet. I was using SD for 6 months till that point. I couldn't create a toothbrush at all. Base models are powerful, but require different frameworks to generate great results. 

The way to think of this is : Base models are good for exploration. But if you have a specific type of output in mind, they fail.
[2023-06-22, 17:37:57] Kishore GenAI: I can feel the pain😂

[2023-06-23, 19:11:46] Kishore GenAI: Glyph control does this. 

We propose a glyph-conditional text-to-image generation model named GlyphControl for visual text generation, which outperforms DeepFloyd IF and Stable Diffusion in terms of OCR accuracy and CLIP score while saving the number of parameters by more than 3×.

We introduce a visual text generation benchmark named LAION-Glyph by filtering the LAION-2B-en and selecting the images with rich visual text content by using the modern OCR system

I could use some help with something. I've been successfully running stable diffusion locally using automatic1111, and I have a specific configuration using controlnet that I really like. Now, I'm wondering if there's a way to export all the models used, including loras and configurations, so that I can run it on a cloud server without needing to download any extra dependencies.

Any suggestions on how I can achieve this? Your input would be greatly appreciated!

[2023-06-27, 11:14:44] Abhishek Maiti: Yes, the UV map specifically, albedo would be a good to have but not necessary as of now :)
[2023-06-27, 11:17:48] ~ lirus: I think currently the right way to do it is,
-> Generate 3 model from sparse views (or single image lol).
-> Export the implicit as mesh. This should give you the albedo. 

I am not sure if you can directly do image to texture because you somehow need the idea of depth/normals for textures so it should ideally involve a 3D-generation step.

*Definition of Image Harmonization*: Image harmonization is a process used in photo editing to achieve visual consistency in composite images by adjusting the appearances of foreground to make them compatible with the background
[2023-06-30, 21:55:57] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Looking for same 🫡👊
[2023-07-01, 13:23:21] Sudharshan GenAI: Can use a LORA? Thinking out loud

There are LIT (very bright), offset noise and detail tweaker loras. You can train for image harmonization too

[2023-07-04, 11:18:45] ~ Tapan: Hi, I'm Tapan Aslot, a Creative Director and AI Artist who is passionate about integrating artificial intelligence into the branding and advertising industry. I've had the privilege of collaborating with several prominent national and international brands in India and am actively engaged in creating Generative AI use cases while sharing my insights with the wider community. I'm grateful that my work has been recognized internationally, with my thought process and predictions being explored in in-depth interviews featured in multiple publications. Additionally, I'm a member of the Generative AI roundtable at INDIAai formed by MeitY, NeGD, and NASSCOM, where I have the opportunity to contribute to discussions that are directly influencing the AI policies that the government will implement in the near future.

Here is my Linktree profile: https://linktr.ee/tapanaslot

[2023-07-06, 12:05:53] Vignesh Baskaran: A bit naive question at this point but i am trying to understand this at a fundamental level

Why is Midjourney so much better than any other existing offerings for text to image?
[2023-07-06, 12:06:23] Vignesh Baskaran: Midjourney is out of the box because RLHF is built into the product.
Stable Diffusion gives you more tools and control but it takes some work to achieve Midjourney levels of output
[2023-07-06, 12:07:45] Vignesh Baskaran: This interesting conversation was taking place in another group of the GenAI community and we can take this forward here in this group as it is more suited to the folks in this group
[2023-07-06, 12:09:48] Sudharshan GenAI: Is there a way to create AI-generated fonts with Stable diffusion? 

I have a few ideas with GANs but curious to hear the community's thoughts with newer diffusion models
[2023-07-06, 12:12:48] Vignesh Baskaran: Is there any reference that MJ uses RLHF?
[2023-07-06, 12:12:52] Vignesh Baskaran: BTW, here is a reference for RL on Image generation: https://rl-diffusion.github.io/
[2023-07-06, 12:13:25] Vignesh Baskaran: Abstract here: We train diffusion models directly on downstream objectives using reinforcement learning (RL). We do this by posing denoising diffusion as a multi-step decision-making problem, enabling a class of policy gradient algorithms that we call denoising diffusion policy optimization (DDPO). We use DDPO to finetune Stable Diffusion on objectives that are difficult to express via prompting, such as image compressibility, and those derived from human feedback, such as aesthetic quality. We also show that DDPO can be used to improve prompt-image alignment without any human annotations using feedback from a vision-language model.

[2023-07-08, 01:41:16] Saurabh Qblocks: Its really easy to discredit someone just like that

We worked with him closely 
he is brutally honest and tested our product multiple times and pushed back before sharing with the world

He pushed back because he found a few bugs and flaws

Not sure why working with an influencer to reach a greater audience wrong if its done authentically
[2023-07-08, 01:42:36] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: A paid opinion has significantly less value than a honest opinion. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-07-08, 01:42:56] Saurabh Qblocks: Not always
[2023-07-08, 01:43:17] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: And after a while, it becomes difficult to distinguish between paid and organic.
[2023-07-08, 01:43:19] Saurabh Qblocks: Opinion formed after thorough testing of a product is honest
[2023-07-08, 01:43:46] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: If product is good, people will promote without payment.
[2023-07-08, 01:44:53] Saurabh Qblocks: Wrong
Real world doesn’t work on this alone

Its always a mix

All the hype that you see on chatGPT was built with a combination of paid and organic
[2023-07-08, 01:45:14] Saurabh Qblocks: Even a great product needs promotion
[2023-07-08, 01:45:29] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: ChatGPT paid for promotion?
[2023-07-08, 01:45:45] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: People lined up outside to try and post reviews
[2023-07-08, 01:45:53] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Anyway, off topic
[2023-07-08, 01:45:58] Saurabh Qblocks: Yes
All the twitter influencers that roll out during their launch are not organically doing it
[2023-07-08, 01:46:12] Saurabh Qblocks: I said mix
[2023-07-08, 01:46:46] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I think this is true right now. And the fact is the products that are doing the best right now are mainly due to promotion and also product quality. It is a mix unfortunately. Unlike xgboost 😂
[2023-07-08, 01:46:58] Gaurav MonsterAPI Qblocks: Comparing with Chatgpt which is backed by Microsoft and got all the pr as Google killer cannot and should not be compared with a startup with 1/1000th in backing.
[2023-07-08, 01:48:19] Saurabh Qblocks: Why does Apple spend over a billion dollars on promotions even though they have a known brand loved by billions and with a series great products??

I will say this again

Real world doesn’t work on organic alone

Its always a mix
[2023-07-08, 01:50:08] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Product marketing strategy vs Trustworthiness of paid opinion. We were discussing second.
[2023-07-08, 01:50:21] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I agree on principle. But after watching products do well and the reasons behind them in gen AI space, practical reality seems different
[2023-07-08, 01:52:02] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Paid opinions to be always taken with skepticism regardless of honesty of reviewers. This part I agree with you.
[2023-07-08, 01:53:22] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Bhai-o or Behno, before Nirant kick us all out for being off-topic, got to come back to AI discussion.

Not paid or unpaid stuff

Don’t judge
[2023-07-08, 01:55:50] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Haan fine tuning LLMs. How do you think gpt4 finetuning will work? Since it's already a RLHF tuned model?
[2023-07-08, 02:00:10] Gaurav MonsterAPI Qblocks: You are referring to the llm finetuning product shared above? 
We are focusing on open source LLMs. 
Supported models right now are gpt j, stablelm, falcon, openllama etc.
[2023-07-08, 02:00:43] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: No. I'm focusing on just finetuning an RLHF tuned model
[2023-07-08, 02:00:52] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Any will do
[2023-07-08, 02:19:12] Gaurav MonsterAPI Qblocks: I think for that case, we can first fine-tune an llm on a specific domain or task, then train a reward model on human annotated data and then fine-tune the LLM with the reward model. I think this is a good guide for reference with OSS LLMs + lora for memory optimisation, more details on the steps here: https://huggingface.co/blog/trl-peft

We are also exploring right now for adding support of the reward model part.
[2023-07-08, 02:37:43] Vignesh Baskaran: This group specifically focuses on Generative Art discussion. There are other groups in this community focusing on LLMs and another one on Ethics.

- couldn't find any good speech outputs for the Spanish language

If no open source then what's the best paid api - murf?

[2023-07-20, 16:59:19] Sudharshan GenAI: Hey folks,

I'm trying to do inpainting for product photography but facing a weird issue. We're using HF diffusers.

I'm inpainting the bg in, and the product is left untouched - but the text within the product is getting distorted

Works in auto1111 but not with HF diffusers. 

Here are some examples

[2023-07-20, 17:00:42] Dev Aggarwal: Have to recomposite the original object back onto the final image
[2023-07-20, 17:01:28] Sudharshan GenAI: Why? 

Only the bg is masked so it can be inpainted
‎[2023-07-20, 17:02:06] Sudharshan GenAI: ‎image omitted
[2023-07-20, 17:02:26] Dev Aggarwal: The image still goes through the net, even if its masked, it gets distorted via the diffusion process
[2023-07-20, 17:05:45] ~ Shaurya Gupta: You can have a controlnet over the masked image as a combination to preserve the internal text
[2023-07-20, 17:06:17] Dev Aggarwal: PIL.Image.composite() + slight cropping / resizing of object to deal with image segmentation edge inconsistencies
[2023-07-20, 17:06:57] Dev Aggarwal: There’s a control net model for text ? 👀
[2023-07-20, 17:07:30] Ravi Theja: better to share your writeup - https://gooey.ai/product-photo-background-generator/

[2023-07-20, 17:11:06] Dev Aggarwal: Not sure but Auto1111 definitely does some vodoo with the latents that hf does not

[2023-07-20, 17:13:54] Divya Tak: Why not try with Photoshop ai
[2023-07-20, 17:16:35] Sudharshan GenAI: This is just base SD1.5 with simple prompts, I can make it look very realisitc
[2023-07-20, 17:16:51] Sudharshan GenAI: But point was to highlight the text inside
[2023-07-20, 17:17:15] Sudharshan GenAI: Auto's code is such a mess - hard to figure out what's going under the hood
[2023-07-20, 17:46:23] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Can elaborate on this please

[2023-07-20, 17:54:07] ~ Shaurya Gupta: also, the image aspect got stretched during resize, but can be fixed by placing object in more white area
[2023-07-20, 17:54:35] ~ Shaurya Gupta: https://github.com/mikonvergence/ControlNetInpaint refer to this for the same
[2023-07-20, 17:55:10] ~ Shaurya Gupta: canny can preserve text better if its large but in case of very small, it might fail
‎[2023-07-20, 18:15:00] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: ‎image omitted
[2023-07-20, 23:15:10] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Yea. We recently rewrote the inpaint too finally for diffusers, iirc there’s a similar PR out there that does exact same thing we did internally.

Automatic111 is fairly different in handling latents than diffusers. 

However, this issue is slightly more fundamental. Sd1.5 can’t really recreate text back after diffusion reliably. 

Hack I had tried was some text controlnet and overlay that at the last step.  But this wasn’t perfect either.
[2023-07-20, 23:15:21] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: But this is assuming the issue is only text.
[2023-07-20, 23:15:57] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: This is easy to remove. Many models to erase this provided there is a human input.

[2023-07-21, 09:34:22] Ojasvi Yadav: Dwelved quite deep into this a few months ago

My solution to this was to add blur, essentially gaussian noise, outwards from the foreground edge, for about 5-10 pixels. Essentially I destroyed some information around the edges that was making SD hallucinate the object boundary.

That helped, but it also made the background blurry.

So i turned down the blur, and added some salt and pepper noise. That is a truly random noise signal.
[2023-07-21, 09:34:34] Ojasvi Yadav: Still around the edges only, 5-10 pixels outbound from the edges
[2023-07-21, 09:34:39] Ojasvi Yadav: the results were great
[2023-07-21, 09:35:02] Ojasvi Yadav: salt and pepper noise didn't just diminish the previous information near the foreground edges
[2023-07-21, 09:35:57] Ojasvi Yadav: results were nearly perfect edges, but at the unintended benefit of adding some background blur as a side-effect
[2023-07-21, 09:39:50] Ojasvi Yadav: but it also let SD work with a noise, and not a real image near the object edges

that way I was able to remove the context that SD was using to hallucinate these horrible extensions

[2023-07-21, 10:12:15] Divya Tak: This would be out of syllabus for AI. You can use ai assist but you'll need someone to manually do a lot. Because a) face information is lost and b) damage looks like clothes people are wearing too.

[2023-07-21, 12:21:16] Kishore GenAI: Is this the only image of the people or are there other pictures where they exist either independently or together?
[2023-07-21, 12:22:47] Kishore GenAI: As @919619491715 mentioned, since there is not data on how the face would look like, you will only get a generic face which might fill it.
[2023-07-21, 12:22:51] Sudharshan GenAI: https://sd-fabric.github.io/

Pretty cool - MJ type reward training for SD
[2023-07-21, 12:23:14] Kishore GenAI: Otherwise you can use some sort of inversion if you have any other datapoints for the face
[2023-07-21, 12:28:32] Kishore GenAI: There is a video by johnothan witaker, in the fast.ai course and he mentions this. That the model acts as a compression and a decompression algorithm. It doesnt fully restore the original datapoints. He took an example of the parrot and then got the latents out and recreated the original image. In that example, the eye of the parrot got distorted. 

The issue persists with letters as well. If you just run a image through without necessarily modifying it through the diffusers pipeline, the end image will showcase distortion in the text. You cannot get the same text back by using diffusers at least till end of April 2023, which is when I moved away from it. 

if you read the mikubil's inpainting fix, you would see that they are copy pasting the values back from the original image to the output image.
[2023-07-21, 12:29:00] Kishore GenAI: Hoping for great results from Zero shot inpainting won't work.
[2023-07-21, 12:29:55] Sudharshan GenAI: Oh right! I remember reading this a long time back. Let me check the fix
[2023-07-21, 12:30:02] ~ Abhilash K Pai: unfortunately no
[2023-07-21, 12:30:05] Sudharshan GenAI: Agree
[2023-07-21, 12:30:46] Dev Aggarwal: PIL.Image.composite is the easiest 😆
[2023-07-21, 12:31:52] Kishore GenAI: This is common when you just try to use regular inpaint. There are extension on the product. My understanding is this is because the inpainting pipeline doesn't necessarily know whether there is a shoe outside of the needed area. Which means there has to be instruction provided during the generation process on where the shoe ends.
[2023-07-21, 12:32:34] Kishore GenAI: Hence here also you can see an extension on top of the bottle cap.
[2023-07-21, 12:33:12] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Actually for us, the edge issue was less of an issue on RV4. Maybe going from sd 1.5 to RV has improved thus
[2023-07-21, 12:34:23] Kishore GenAI: But that is very model dependent. Which means that for every model upgrade there has to be a test case built in. Additionally given the uncertain nature and the amount of variable input products, the solution of model changing is more of a patch fix then an actual solution
‎[2023-07-21, 12:35:14] ~ Abhilash K Pai: ‎image omitted
[2023-07-21, 12:36:57] Vignesh Baskaran: Agreed
[2023-07-21, 12:37:11] Kishore GenAI: Use scribble or canny edge and then recreate the photo. 
Workflow:
1. Use the original image.
2. Draw the outline of the face of the people on top of the image with either photoshop or any open source tools
3. Use canny edge and img2img with hi-res face fix. 

My understanding is that this should give you a pretty good output.
[2023-07-21, 12:39:59] Kishore GenAI: Yeah. This is the same as what I mentioned. 

There are multiple composites available to use:
1. The entire product 
2. Only the label
3. Only the text in the label

It also depends on which area is getting screwed up the most. Ideally I would want to preseve the output image as much as possible.
[2023-07-21, 12:40:45] Dev Aggarwal: Or if you’re lazy just cut down the image border by 5% and paste it
[2023-07-21, 12:40:49] Dev Aggarwal: 😂
[2023-07-21, 12:44:55] Kishore GenAI: This ain't necessarily true yet. The issue with the photo of the perfume bottle on rocks is that this is not natural for how a perfume bottle is showcased. 

These models are trained on available image datasets, which mean that if it is close to how a product image in the dataset is, then it would produce results which feel realistic. This also means that there are very specific types of photos based on the product type.

Example: F&B products have a bunch of fruits or ingredients in them. If you generate an image with those, it would feel realistic because of the number of photos we have seen of that type. Whereas, for skincare, if you have a product on a washroom slab with a basin and mirror, then it would feel like a product photoshoot .

[2023-07-21, 13:42:41] Sudharshan GenAI: Flair does this well right? Create an easy template
[2023-07-21, 13:46:12] Ojasvi Yadav: 😍
[2023-07-21, 13:47:00] Vignesh Baskaran: The TG for such a product isn't matured enough to work with Generative AI. 

The product that we think they want is not what they want.

The tech which will do what they want doesn't exist to the best of my knowledge. 

To summarize the Flair type images isn't what they want

[2023-07-21, 13:48:01] Sudharshan GenAI: Can you elaborate? What do they  (customers) want?
[2023-07-21, 13:48:05] Kishore GenAI: This assumes your TG is someone who didnt use photoshop before.
[2023-07-21, 13:48:32] Kishore GenAI: My understanding is that this will act more to empower designers to ramp up and do more work than what they could pre GenAI
[2023-07-21, 13:48:40] Kishore GenAI: My framing is copilot for design
[2023-07-21, 13:49:52] Ojasvi Yadav: That's an easier path to building a product out of this tech
[2023-07-21, 13:50:47] Ojasvi Yadav: But again, if designers aren't taking this up with full enthusiasm then it's not the time yet
[2023-07-21, 13:51:57] Ojasvi Yadav: It has to be "I'm stupid if I don't use this tech" or nothing
[2023-07-21, 13:53:44] Ojasvi Yadav: And I'm openly saying that after working on this through weekend all-nighters while juggling a full-time role during the week
[2023-07-21, 13:54:37] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Maybe not every company has a full time designer? Maybe it's small restaurant owner who wants to make his own product photo or start up founder who doesn't want to learn adobe? If something can do the job quickly (micro saas) then why not?
[2023-07-21, 13:55:11] Ojasvi Yadav: Will you teach them to write stable diffusion prompts?
[2023-07-21, 13:55:36] Ojasvi Yadav: I ended up writing prompts myself for such people
[2023-07-21, 13:56:15] Ojasvi Yadav: You don't want to run a business where you or your employees are writing prompts for your clients
[2023-07-21, 13:56:56] Ojasvi Yadav: It's not scalable because then your success is incumbent on how many prompt writers you can hire
[2023-07-21, 13:58:06] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Prompts part seems doable through a semi rigid UI like Flair perhaps. What do you think breaks that?

Anyways, good to have healthy debates. Need to first solve this nasty bug. Composing object back seems to be working (of course) but the depth and all is a little messed up 🤣😤
[2023-07-21, 14:01:28] Ojasvi Yadav: Yes. Love these discussions. This group is my favourite 😂♥️
[2023-07-21, 14:24:15] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: The draft that bard generates- are they outputs from different models or just the same model being run thrice??

[2023-07-21, 15:08:50] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: I think hexo ai is also doing this
[2023-07-21, 15:09:13] Kishore GenAI: Yep. He and I keep chatting with each other :D @32486634341
[2023-07-21, 15:11:00] Kishore GenAI: This would be a race to the bottom then. If the output quality is not high in priority, you would rather use the cheapest option out there. Building this as a business would end up being difficult in my opinion.
[2023-07-21, 15:13:18] Kishore GenAI: IMHO prompts are bad from user experience standpoint. It changes based on a model. Please think of workflows where prompts are very direct. Example: Instructpix2pix for editing. "Make this red" ,"Change dog to cat" are doable by normal people. But "(((best quality))),(((ultra detailed))),(((masterpiece))),illustration,” asian couple, sunset, beach, beer, back view, orange sky, white dress style, vacation" is a very difficult skill to master
[2023-07-21, 15:15:22] Kishore GenAI: The idea is that people know what they want in the end images. For me it is more of going from point A to B rather than just exploration. Adding assets and controlling the foreground is how I am looking into it. I am not focused on zero shot image gen. Expecting zero shot to work is a very tall ask 😅
[2023-07-21, 15:20:36] Ojasvi Yadav: Yes
[2023-07-21, 15:24:54] Kishore GenAI: Can you explain what you mean by this? @919971004124
[2023-07-21, 15:26:58] Kishore GenAI: @917737887058 Is it possible to conduct an online meetup? Instead of a physical one in bangalore? Specifically for Generative Art group. A meetup which is not related to LLM's.
[2023-07-21, 15:28:29] Ojasvi Yadav: .
[2023-07-21, 15:28:47] Ojasvi Yadav: But that's just my opinion and I'm a nobody
[2023-07-21, 15:29:10] Ojasvi Yadav: If someone can pull it off then they have my full respect
[2023-07-21, 15:32:44] Ojasvi Yadav: Because I have first hand experience of struggling to find profit here
[2023-07-21, 15:33:24] Kishore GenAI: Makes sense.
[2023-07-21, 15:33:31] Kishore GenAI: That becomes more of a service based business

[2023-07-21, 16:20:50] Divya Tak: Do you have any ideas specifically?
[2023-07-21, 16:21:03] Divya Tak: I am not opposed to an online meetup
[2023-07-21, 16:21:23] Divya Tak: But I personally don't feel super engaged in those
[2023-07-21, 16:21:37] Divya Tak: We can ask @919008639111 on how to do some fun things on those
[2023-07-21, 16:22:28] Divya Tak: She has a lot of experience with doing cool online sessions and all
[2023-07-21, 16:23:24] Kishore GenAI: None as such. The request for online is because I am in Mumbai, some are in bangalore, some in europre and singapore.

[2023-07-22, 11:57:49] ~ Adhitya Swaminathan: I’ve seen this happen when using diffusion networks for video generation in the past. I think this happens because the first step is going from image to latent space, which is done via inverse DDIM processing (latent inversion essentially). The problem is that this isn’t a lossless process, and it doesn’t work well if the image is not close to the latent distribution of the models. Which is why the outputs get weirder and weirder. This whitening pattern is a telltale sign as well. I could be wrong here, this is just based on my observations.
[2023-07-22, 12:15:45] ~ Adhitya Swaminathan: @918826215025 check out one example that I ran. The first image is the original (think of it as the last frame of the video), and the second one is the one reconstructed from inverted latents. You can see a lot of sharpness and detailing missing. Inversion is lossy, and even if the image is produced by the exact same model as the one used for inversion (which I do in this case with photoreal2), it cannot do it properly. People have suggested null text inversion as an alternative, but at the end of the day, it’s still not lossless, so it’s only a matter of time before it’ll start breaking.

[2023-07-22, 12:31:17] Shashank Generative AI Group: yeah. right now Gen-2 is a nice exploratory toy IMO. fun to play with.  

anyways, if someone wanted to make a longer coherent video, there are better ways to do that. (controlnet-video etc)
[2023-07-22, 12:34:22] ~ Adhitya Swaminathan: Gen2 is somehow just not impressive to me at all. You’d expect a lot better than what they’ve put out now.
[2023-07-22, 12:41:27] Shashank Generative AI Group: it reminds me of vqgan+clip colab notebooks 2 years back. so, i sorta like it in that sense. gotta enjoy the weird imperfect outputs while they last😂

personally, i think Gen-1 is better in a way as it gives more control via an input video. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-07-22, 20:41:05] Amogh V: Here's a brief overview of the process - 
1. Started with the image Abhilash gave and used CLIP interrogator to get some basic idea of what to include in the prompt. Most of the result was not useful quality of the image but some tokens were helpful.
2. Drew an outline of the first person's face and clothes in a new layer on Photoshop.
3. Used inpainting on the original image. Made a mask over only the first person. Used the outline in controlnet with lineart model. Iterated until I got a face I liked, playing with settings. While doing this you start to get an intuition of how to bend this image to your will. Especially about how to work with this this vintage photo style, which settings are working and and what generations and colors are acceptable etc. DPM++ 2M Karras sampler.
4. To get the hands right the best way is to inpaint over rough drawn hands or a reference image positioned where you need it (needs color correction though).
5. Getting the karate gi dress was hard because it had to come out in the exact style. Generated a lot of images, layered them over each other and selectively erased parts of one layer to expose the better generated element in the underlying layer. 
6. Then most of it was iterations of inpaint -> evaluate result -> edit in Photoshop to prepare image for the next inpaint. Repeat until satisfied

[2023-07-23, 03:14:57] Divya Tak: Animation is a totally different ball game than just image generation man. Like the visual style I still could have thought of as Ghibli. But animation is just so far. Very intriguing how brain is able to be much more perceptive about motion.
[2023-07-23, 14:18:19] Vamshi: This is true with almost just anything AI generated - though sometimes it can compare with a good tutorial on YouTube to imitate that style - feels unfinished
[2023-07-23, 14:18:49] Vamshi: And for the same reason the same applies to human imitations too!
[2023-07-23, 14:34:36] Kunal Bhatia Hexo: Adding my POV to this discussion since we're building in this domain at Hexo:

Building a quick workaround that just inpaints the background around a product will not produce outputs that can fly with serious brands. 

It's easy to build an interface that expects users to enter complicated prompts. (That's the image gen equivalent of building a wrapper app on ChatGPT) Hence, there are 100s of folks trying product photography as a use case. Might be able to sell to small d2c brands as they aren't heavy on brand compliance.

But if the intent is to sell to bigger brands, it's f'ing difficult to make the model generate images in one shot that also complies with a brand's specific styles. Requires a lot of re-engineering of models and pipelines. 

If anyone can make that happen, it can actually enable autonomous/one click social media & performance content generation. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-07-23, 14:38:31] Kunal Bhatia Hexo: What does a co-pilot for design really mean? 

When working with language models, even a 60% 'good enough' output is acceptable since the user can just copy and edit the output the way they like. 

With images/video etc, even 98% accuracy is not good enough (unless you're goal isn't photorealistic output), since editing pixels isn't as straight forward as editing text.
[2023-07-23, 15:44:30] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: @919901704680 amazing framing.
Number of times I’ve been telling ppl that doing 60 percent good animation is far far far easier than 90 percent good comics.

Because expectation isn’t just pretty pics but pretty pics with a lot of control in them.

One the reasons our tool now has a lot of ai “assisting” features to give lot more control over what’s being generated.
[2023-07-23, 15:45:49] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: It’s also why diffusers is becoming slightly painful to work with. It abstracts a lot of internals of image generation that need to be altered.

Anyone else facing such kind of things?
[2023-07-23, 15:47:25] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: True. For video and animation the bar is 99%. Just spent whole weekend testing some modifications on wav2lip to improve lip synching and giving up on some experiments I was doing on synthetic video. So, agree and cheers (literally) 🙂 If anyone has managed to better lip synch after 8 seconds, then do ping and we can find a way to work together. 

One thing I can see is that margins in video are insane. Production cost (excl. people cost) is 5-10cents. Heygen,etc are selling for 2$ per video.
[2023-07-23, 15:48:32] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Yes even a ai in the loop kind of process in videos has really good business but I feel the industry is fairly scattered to be a b2b saas play on this.
[2023-07-23, 15:49:29] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I think some content house like Pixar is better placed to innovate the ai in loop process to really build a product.
[2023-07-23, 15:49:44] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Or Dashtoon someday 😅
[2023-07-23, 15:52:11] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Haha I will be happy with synthetic synthesia like videos but much much cheaper. Have a use case and a buyer but can't get reasonable lip-synching after 8 seconds. Trying some hacks.

Anyone here into lip synching of videos?
[2023-07-23, 15:52:34] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Our ads have some bit.
[2023-07-23, 15:52:39] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Let me ping.

[2023-07-23, 15:56:32] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: So for us this works for the use case of getting ppl to try Dashtoon but I am not sure if it’s good enough for ppl to pay.
[2023-07-23, 15:56:54] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: By Pay , I mean pay for the content itself.
[2023-07-23, 16:00:51] Digvijay GenAI Group: Great job , funny story

[2023-07-23, 16:04:41] Digvijay GenAI Group: Hmm the genres aren’t really my ☕️ of tea , more manga / anime style stuff soon ?
[2023-07-23, 16:05:33] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Nice.

Love humans (as I am one of them) but that breaks the cost structure :-(

Noticed that in your video you are also not doing long lip synchs.
[2023-07-23, 16:05:34] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Yea I understand. Not mine either but seems this works 😅

More variety content as we make more money.
[2023-07-23, 16:09:37] Digvijay GenAI Group: Id thought Dashtoon is an artist platform , or are you launching multiple products ?
[2023-07-23, 16:12:39] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Yea it’s both with intent to have creation and consumption both on platform. YouTube/TikTok like
[2023-07-23, 16:27:13] Shashank Generative AI Group: this is so good 😂👏👏👏

is the whole video made in Dashtoon too? like the subtle hair movements etc.
[2023-07-23, 16:29:03] Shashank Generative AI Group: nvm got it👍
[2023-07-23, 16:35:45] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: This is nice, how is engagement
[2023-07-23, 16:36:49] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: This is still good. Are you planning to build a video content platform as well apart from comics?
[2023-07-23, 16:46:27] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: This is just an ad and works decently well to get ppl to download the app. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-07-23, 16:46:52] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Someday sure. Right now, using these as ads to get ppl to read comics.
[2023-07-23, 16:48:00] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: If we can get to creating these to something like 1 day for 20 min video then we think it makes sense else not really sure.
[2023-07-23, 16:48:09] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: One person.
[2023-07-23, 16:49:16] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: It is like moving from manga comics to an anime. 
For me, anime is more interactive than a comic. Also way bigger TAM.
[2023-07-23, 16:50:34] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Yea I know but harder to bring consistency too. Definitely want to do it sometime but short term is to focus and build a business with comics.
[2023-07-23, 16:51:11] Divya Tak: Also bigger TAM but also bigger challenges. Animation, audio, sound, VO
[2023-07-23, 16:51:15] Madhur Sawhney Dashtoon: Need a 💵 🐮 .
[2023-07-23, 16:53:10] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: What is the market like for comics? What is the target group? Where are the paying customers? Definitely not in India I suppose?
[2023-07-23, 16:53:11] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Assistive AI for everything 😅
[2023-07-23, 16:54:27] Madhur Sawhney Dashtoon: Right now we are targeting US audience. Most of them are in the age group of 25-44. 
India can be a good market with the right pricing, however our pricing is too high for the india market. We will change that soon
[2023-07-23, 16:55:30] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Indian customer doesn’t want to pay much for Stories SVOD ott shows that
[2023-07-23, 16:55:34] Divya Tak: Ha but all of those are atleast rn even less solved than image is.
[2023-07-23, 16:56:23] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: US youngsters make sense. Also any insight into what genres work? What kind of stories ?
[2023-07-23, 16:57:20] Madhur Sawhney Dashtoon: A good price point to have a good TAM in india market is 29/49 pack.
[2023-07-23, 16:57:44] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Secret millionaire is totally pocketfm playbook. But pocketfm also heavy burn
[2023-07-23, 16:58:13] Kunal Bhatia Hexo: Wave 1 - wrapper apps
Wave 2 - assistive AI

[2023-07-23, 17:04:14] Madhur Sawhney Dashtoon: Pocket fm doesn’t have a heavy burn. They have really good unit economics. However, romance targeted at females is the biggest genre in webcomic markets in the US. Massy content and good content is very different from a business stand point
[2023-07-23, 17:05:55] Madhur Sawhney Dashtoon: A good article for insights on content

[2023-07-23, 17:06:01] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: I read a report saying 11 rupees spent to make 1 rupee
[2023-07-23, 17:07:06] Madhur Sawhney Dashtoon: Yeag, they took out earnings from some Indian portal but major revenue is in the US not india
[2023-07-23, 17:09:15] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: I guess let’s take pocketfm on dm  and stick to ai art here now. 😅
[2023-07-23, 17:51:15] Amogh V: Adding to the brand photography discussion earlier - I think generating backgrounds according to the brand guidelines is one problem and blending the product into the image is a separate problem. In the case of backgrounds, latent diffusion will work really well and there are so many tools to get the colours, style and vibe of the brand consistently. I would not want to use diffusion where the product photo is concerned because that will add noise to the photo and denoise it in a way that will make it look different from the product.
[2023-07-23, 17:53:54] Amogh V: So I’d recommend using “non-destructive” computer vision techniques to do colour correction according to lighting and add shadows ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-07-23, 19:04:15] Divya Tak: Is there a degree of error in which QR codes are still readable
[2023-07-23, 19:06:19] Dev Aggarwal: I think there are broadly 2 cases where genai product marketinng can be super lucrative -

1. Doing extraordinarily crative artwork - stuff that humans can’t easily reproduce or think of (eg a kitkat shaped as an avocado)

2. Hyper personalisation at a scale that humans can’t have good throughput on (eg the cadbury personalised diwali campaign)

Anything that ends up producing artifacts that can be replicated in canva/ps is very hard to sell
[2023-07-23, 19:07:13] Dev Aggarwal: No, its still hit and trial, but we have knobs that let you regulate the clarity of the qr code
[2023-07-23, 20:01:59] ~ Prasad: probably too late but. brain pov i agree its quite different. like there are two visual pathways, one is motion pathway and one is content pathway (colour, texture..). motion pathway is fast (evolutionary fast motion sensing=live vs die) content pathway is slow. there are further slower paths such as face has dedicated path which is still slower. this adds to temporal aspect to processing, that means delays and feed forward predictions (more scope to hallucinate). at the consciousness level, brain still builds a coherent picture (which i find quite mind bending tbh). also there are differences in how animation is processed by brain (vs reality), for example eye saccades are more for animation that has less texture but fine texture animation is often slower. 

ai is good far spacial tasks but hasnt been too great for temporal information (yet). so it will be interesting to see how it goes. fun times.
[2023-07-23, 20:17:31] Vignesh Baskaran: Very true!
[2023-07-23, 21:35:13] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Tried a bunch of tools like Heygen, D-ID, Sadtalker, Elai etc. but ear can still tell if the speech is AI generated or actual. What can be a better way to make the audio undifferentiable in anyone’s experience?

[2023-07-25, 14:38:40] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: https://youtu.be/_9LX9HSQkWo Could someone help me understand the cost implications of doing a 10 minute video in this style. What GPU instances/services on would need and how much would they cost me??
[2023-07-25, 14:47:53] Divya Tak: thats 14400 frames assuming 24FPS, and assuming you dont do any redundant generations. If you go the generate 4 and choose 1 to upscale path then it would be slightly different
[2023-07-25, 15:05:06] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Are you including model training and fine tuning costs?
[2023-07-25, 15:05:14] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: For each character
[2023-07-25, 15:06:24] Divya Tak: no i am just giving frame number, they have done what would be equivalent of motion capture right. They made video and then generated guided image on each frame
[2023-07-25, 15:08:15] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Yeah, but the style that is being applied on each frame is through a model trained (and retrained) on the character in the particular animation style
[2023-07-25, 15:09:02] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: I just wanted an overall cost including model training
[2023-07-25, 15:09:07] Divya Tak: then how does 10 minute cost matter? wouldn't the training part be the more expensive thing?
[2023-07-25, 15:10:00] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Yeah usi ka puch raha tha
[2023-07-25, 15:34:36] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Not really. It’s a very simple dreambooth training. 

Takes around 8h at max on an A10 which is 1.5usd per hour on Aws. 

Also he did two different dreambooths
[2023-07-25, 15:35:07] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Inference is separate cost
[2023-07-25, 15:35:31] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Also corridor crew has a very step wise tutorial to do that.
[2023-07-25, 15:35:50] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: We have literally followed the same thing for fun too.
[2023-07-25, 15:36:12] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Time can reduce depending on images and some parameters too.

[2023-08-08, 09:49:19] Shashwat TDC: Hey guys, gm. Just entered this space. Looking for reliable text2video solutions for marketing purposes. 

As always market is filled with the clickbaity demos. Looking for reliable recos here.

Any suggestions wud be appreciated
[2023-08-08, 09:52:40] Kishore GenAI: Can you define reliable?
[2023-08-08, 09:54:19] Shashwat TDC: Simple things : assets generated not looking like foreign objects with 6 fingers etc. 

Last I tried to RunwayML and dream studio, it was generating all sorts of crap.
[2023-08-08, 10:08:07] Kishore GenAI: None of the solutions are great and reliable in the way you are talking about. It will take considerable amount of time for you to get videos without 6 fingers. Images are still imperfect, and they have been out for close to a year. There are frameworks to generate images with 5 fingers etc, but they took time post the original model release. Currently the video space is more like Dalle
[2023-08-08, 10:16:16] Nirant K: FWIW — This also means there is more money to be made from going deeper and throwing compute at large datasets right now than in 2 years from today
[2023-08-08, 10:17:08] Nirant K: DALLE was arguably more revenue for OpenAI than SD was for Stability till 20 days ago (AWS+SDXL changes that) 
[2023-08-08, 10:20:13] Kishore GenAI: The issue is money and feasibility. And this is open research as of now. There is a podcast by Elad Gill and Sarah of Conviction with Devi (One of the senior directors at FAIR). She mentioned that she is surprised that even post 9 months of make a scene release there haven't been more model releases and also talks about the challenges. (https://youtu.be/x7n5Fdc3u0I)
[2023-08-08, 10:20:34] Kishore GenAI: And this is plain vanilla video gen
[2023-08-08, 10:31:42] Kishore GenAI: Also, isn't the popularity due to SD release and the numerous work done by multiple research institute. There was a lot of research done in leveraging pretrained t2i models to perform various tasks. Controlnet is one of the better examples out there. Stability might have made less money, but midjourney is doing well I assume.

If there is money to be made in Video, how would you expect it to play? without opensource models, I do not think there will be sufficient innovation, but then revenue is in question.

[2023-08-09, 16:28:03] Vignesh Baskaran: Folks working on image generation model training, 
Any recommendation of tools to log image outputs, visualize and label them in a nice dashboard? 

*Context*: We have been training image generation models and at the moment we save the intermediary evaluation results locally and visualize them using Jupyter notebooks. Instead if there is a nice dashboard to visualize and label that would make our life much easier. We are planning to experiment with label studio and WandB. 

Would love to try out your recommendations. Thank you

[2023-08-14, 09:34:14] Kishore GenAI: And which pipelines are you talking about? Anything related to inpainting is not worth doing in HF
[2023-08-14, 09:34:26] ~ Rohan Athawade: Isn't A1111 mostly GUI based? I've wanted to work with sd models programmatically

[2023-08-15, 23:02:47] ~ Rohan Athawade: hey guys. does anyone have a guide or any tips as to how avoid deformities while generating people using SD 2.1? anything related to how to structure the input prompt, negative prompts or any sort of observations regarding hyperparameters would be appreciated.
[2023-08-15, 23:41:19] Divya Tak: @917483949751 or @919619491715 or @919008639111 would have great thoughts about this. They have all been making a lot of art with humans
[2023-08-15, 23:47:25] ~ Goji: I would say stay with a clear description of what you're looking for in the generated people. For avoiding deformities, consider using a negative prompt to explicitly specify what you want to avoid - use bracketd to increase the weight ( )
[2023-08-15, 23:56:05] ~ Rohan Athawade: Interesting. Do you know of a proper online guide for these tips?
[2023-08-16, 02:38:10] Divya Tak: You can go to places where you can see prompts and be able to see which ones to use both positive and negative
[2023-08-16, 02:38:55] Divya Tak: And a Google/YT search for Stable diffusion prompting for humans or something would give you some useful resources

[2023-08-16, 07:43:20] Amogh V: 1. Use a checkpoint from Civit Ai that is already fine tuned on data containing lots of human anatomy. This will help avoid deformities more than anything else. For illustrated / anime you can use something like Anything or Dreamshaper (V4 is better for anime / illustration while V7 tends towards realistic. Read the model card). For photorealistic go for Rev Animated, Absolute Reality or something similar.
2. Use a negative embedding like EasyNegative or verybadimagenegative. With Dreamshaper V7 use BadDream and UnrealisticDream together. They're trained by the same guy as Dreamshaper and work well with it.
3. For shots that are not close ups like full body portraits, expect the face details to be bad in the first iteration. That's because a face has a lot of detail that gets compressed into a small latent and pixel space. You can improve using a second iteration where you inpaint over the face. Keep the inpaint area to "only masked" and mask mode to "original" with the denoise at 0.5 for best results. While only-masked is on you can increase the dimensions. This will fill a higher number of pixels only within the inpainting mask without affecting the dimensions of the rest of the image
[2023-08-16, 10:04:19] Sudharshan GenAI: Ageee with all 

Can use Adetailer for better faces - automatically inpaints faces in
[2023-08-16, 10:21:11] Ambika Computational Mama: @919158066359 point 1 is very relevant! it makes all the different to chose the right checkpoint and also ensure to harness the trigger point words.
[2023-08-16, 10:21:45] Ambika Computational Mama: I would recommend that if you are beginner to start off simple and easy with good prompting and negative prompting and then work your way up!! :)
[2023-08-16, 11:11:51] Amogh V: Also, I missed that you said SD 2.1. The only advice I have regarding 2.1 is don't use it! It is much much harder to get good results and not worth the effort honestly. Stick to using SD 1.5 or 1.5 based checkpoints. When SDXL ecosystem matures jump to that directly
[2023-08-16, 11:12:53] Amogh V: With 2.1 you have to write paragraph levels of text in the negative prompt. Not worth it when a simple textual inversion negative embedding with a 1.5 checkpoint does the job
[2023-08-16, 12:21:52] ~ Kaustav: Some of the negative embeddings are very good at solving the anatomy problem. Besides this, the general negative prompt set works,  like - 
''' ugly, duplicate, morbid, mutilated, extra fingers, mutated hands, poorly drawn hands, poorly drawn face, mutation, deformed, blurry, dehydrated, bad anatomy, bad proportions, extra limbs, cloned face, disfigured, gross proportions, malformed limbs, missing arms, missing legs, extra arms, extra legs, fused fingers, too many fingers, long neck ''' 
Yeah and as @Amogh Vaishampayan mentioned, stay away from 2.1 in general.
[2023-08-16, 12:27:07] ~ Kaustav: This workflow would change a bit once SDXL becomes more mainstream, as the refiner is pretty good at taking a latent and fixing issues, but given the current progress I expect it to be a month or 2 away before it is as useful as other 1.5 trained models
[2023-08-16, 13:53:05] Ayush Yadav: Need a little help here, Can I run CLIP & bm25 model on t2.micro instance ??? 

For a hackathon, I am building an outfit generator based on user prompt.
I made an app that uses CLIP model & bm25 model to generate vector embedings from the prompt then compare it with other vectors on pinecone to get me result.

I also use openai api as first layer of communication between user & vector search.

I want to host this project so I can submit it. The problem is I don't think t2.micro has enough resources to even run my project. 
The submission is in few days & I need a solution to this
[2023-08-16, 13:54:33] Ayush Yadav: I already upserted all data to pinecone on my local  just need to query it
[2023-08-16, 13:55:19] Ayush Yadav: I am restricted to free tier, which is why this question.
[2023-08-16, 15:07:12] ~ raj(): iirc the CLIP patch 32 base model is around ~600 mb or so. t2 micro has ~1 GiB memory. you might run into out of memory issues
[2023-08-16, 15:12:28] Ayush Yadav: Ya, but I was looking for solution for this? 

Any work around I can do. 

If nothing works, I am thinking of brute forcing it. 
I am gonna host the backend on my laptop & run it 24/7 until hackathon results arrive.
[2023-08-17, 12:07:26] ~ Rohan Athawade: Does anyone know of any text-guided image variation diffusion models similar to Stable unCLIP?

[2023-08-18, 00:34:11] Shashwat TDC: THis still looks dull/ flat and robotic to me. In other words slow content (as opposed to high dopamine content). 

I mean there is no need for it to be 100% AI-gen. Combination of existing shot assets with some AI-gen can generate really cool results. Creating something in similar lines, will share results. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-08-18, 11:34:51] Amul Twitter Friend: Therapy I guess 😂
due to the satisfaction of compiling my helpful passing-thoughts at one place in a well categorised form

but mostly this:
my 30k tweets have attracted around ~3000 DMs in 2.5 years on twitter as top of the funnel
(final level of funnel is WhatsApp/IRL friends network)

I think me sharing these compiled ebooks of my notes / hypotheses for free on gumroad will

1. 
attract even more vibe-match folks without me having to tweet anymore, because books can be ready async & being free can spread faster

2.
avoid repeating my hypotheses for people who seek those ideas. right now I have to keep pointing people to tweets or threads - and it's exhausting

a good example of such notes is this post a friend compiled from all my tweets / twitter spaces on the topic of job search

this post alone has helped me save a lot of time in pointing people to my scattered writing for the topic of job search games

[2023-08-18, 12:24:53] Amul Twitter Friend: @~Ambika thank you for suggesting, I checked out sudowrite - it is good for writing when you some content in there

but not exactly my use case

I want to give the tool a dump of 30k tweets - and ask it to come up with writing on a topic - by compiling all the information it ate up

am curious if someone can point me to some tutorial/vid of someone doing this and I can follow their steps
[2023-08-18, 12:47:34] Divya Tak: I think, and this is just my hypothesis, but AI is not good at the executive breakdown part of creative work, so you might need to do the breakdown of it on the human side. It also doesn't have taste so you will need to tell it what is "good"
[2023-08-18, 12:52:13] ~ Prajna Prayas: https://youtu.be/Z3bzdBr31RI

[2023-08-18, 13:28:25] Nirant K: The lack of taste is my issue as well
[2023-08-18, 13:29:34] Nirant K: Taste has commercial importance too. E.g. Today, I've spent 2 hours disputing and bouncing off ideas with the CTO on function naming and API design for a consumer facing lib
[2023-08-18, 13:40:45] ~ Prasad: Human taste changes as well. Actually novelty is expected from artists. like if I did a painting from one artist then for the next painting the artist will try doing something new.

I think I don't agree with ai not having taste. It's like people say chatgpt doesn't actually understand anything it says. Reductive so not helpful.
[2023-08-18, 14:04:03] Divya Tak: taste is subjective preference, and AI cant have that no?
[2023-08-18, 14:07:23] ~ Pankaj Chawla: AI agents will probably do that. Learn and develop tastes. Taste is just a manifestation of different paths to learning.
[2023-08-18, 14:34:06] ~ Prasad: Will? But they already do that. Taste of ai is taste of humans who curated the training dataset for the ai.
[2023-08-18, 14:51:10] Divya Tak: LLMs work by finding the "middle of bell curve" things and taste is about finding "edge of the curve" along some axis. I think they are inherently incompatible. Will they be able to guide the way people talk about things in slow ways? sure. But it is a much more GiGo kinda situation.
[2023-08-18, 14:55:36] Dev Aggarwal: Hot take: you don’t want taste in api design, but actually the lowest common denimator so it resonates with most users - something llm is great at
‎[2023-08-18, 14:59:21] Nirant K: ‎GIF omitted
[2023-08-18, 15:03:22] ~ Prasad: Agree, ai taste is mediocre because it comes to average. But novelty and taste are different things, when you talk about niche zones of creations they are novelty.
I think humans have tendency to assign something mystical to taste but it's just a compute problem 👀
[2023-08-18, 15:16:51] ~ Anjineyulu: Any good blog or resource on it please?
[2023-08-18, 15:17:49] Divya Tak: elaborate?
[2023-08-18, 15:18:45] Amul Twitter Friend: Thanks @919953076613 

Lemme think about this
[2023-08-18, 15:19:16] Divya Tak: You're seei ng the resource I use in action XD which is talking to people who have thought about things like this, and update my internal model of the world via that
[2023-08-18, 15:46:41] ~ Anjineyulu: Got it
[2023-08-18, 16:03:10] ~ Prasad: Which part 🤨. Ai taste averages is something you said yourself 🤷‍♂️
[2023-08-18, 16:13:04] Divya Tak: I said AI can't have taste
[2023-08-18, 16:13:11] Divya Tak: Because taste isn't about average
[2023-08-18, 17:43:30] ~ Prasad: hmm. i am not able to follow so i will resort to first principles. taste is an orientation as to how we appreciate beauty. everyone has an orientation so everyone has taste. your orientation may not match mine so what you assess as beautiful, i may not if my orientation is different from yours. so even a simple fly has a taste, it might love dirty food and thats its taste, it matches its orientation. 
now for simplicity take one dimentional orientation, so left or right. some may have orientation left vs some right. so if i have left orientation, i would like an arrow pointing left etc. When i see long left arrow, i would love it, its pointing perfectly for me.

If we train AI though, on a mix or left and right arrows, it will tend to train towards average, so when ai draws arrows, it will create average arrows, not clearly left or right oriented. so ai taste tends towards average.

If we increase dimentions, there comes a factor of novelty. For 2d, if i am used to just seeing arrows pointing left and right, if i see an inclined arrow, i would love it more. this is why we like unique stuff.

in reality, our orientations are multi-dimensional. for example, orientation, color palette etc etc. So when we say something is beautiful, its often something unique. When someone has fine taste, it means they have more dimensions to their orientation.

now i am sure i am boring everyone to death sorry 🙈
[2023-08-18, 17:46:29] ~ Anjineyulu: There is a something called himachal modelling which we have to resort to is what I think
[2023-08-18, 17:46:35] ~ Anjineyulu: Like giving common model as a base
[2023-08-18, 17:46:51] ~ Anjineyulu: And on top of it diffrent models for capturing the variation
[2023-08-18, 17:47:23] ~ Anjineyulu: May be like style transfer which captures styles of images there should be something in NLP too
[2023-08-18, 17:52:58] Divya Tak: And why gpt written stuff in volume makes your eyes glaze over. Because it's so mediocre
[2023-08-18, 17:56:15] Amul Twitter Friend: you mean because it ain't opinionated enough ?
[2023-08-18, 17:57:19] Nirant K: Taste has more it than opinions, but yes, opinion and editing are parts of taste
[2023-08-18, 17:59:17] Divya Tak: No not just that. On a pattern seeking level, it's average, which means brain can't find anything to hold on to (for the lack of a better term)
[2023-08-18, 18:00:02] Divya Tak: You brain also knows what the probable next thing it would say would be
[2023-08-18, 18:01:13] ~ Prasad: thats a very interesting point. the style transfer part actually puts constraints on the possibility space. and funny thing is, the constraints are quite abstract. like 'generate images in the style of ansel adams' is quite abstract. and thats one of the problems of éxplainable ai'.
[2023-08-18, 18:07:28] ~ Anjineyulu: In a hyperspace it should be distinguishable otherwise the model cannot do
‎[2023-08-18, 18:58:27] ~ Prasad: ‎image omitted

[2023-08-18, 19:18:30] ~ Anjineyulu: We can understand right 😅
[2023-08-18, 19:39:33] ~ Anjineyulu: I mean are these really
[2023-08-18, 19:39:35] ~ Anjineyulu: Can u get me a source
[2023-08-18, 19:42:31] ~ Prasad: haha no. but it would look pretty complex once you extract it. like say if you take models of today, or weights or parameter space, it has all the info really about what makes good art (or some mediocre art) but in a very complex form. as divya said - You're seei ng the resource I use in action XD which is talking to people who have thought about things like this, and update my internal model of the world via that 🙈
[2023-08-18, 19:48:36] ~ Anjineyulu: I feel if it is a deterministic stuff we can abstract to user

- No desi voice
- Without editing, we couldn't adjust pauses.

Any suggestions/tips/tutorials/tools to achieve this better?

[2023-08-29, 20:31:02] Ayush Yadav: If we are talking about building a dreambooth powered project, like one of those AI avatar ones. 

How can we reduce the compute on aws ? 

Like running backend 24/7 on a GPU based machine would be very expensive in starting as 0 users, most of the time machine would be ideal.

What technique people use here ? 

Are people using Job based architecture with AWS batch ??

[2023-08-30, 02:13:47] Dev Aggarwal: https://repo-sam.inria.fr/fungraph/3d-gaussian-splatting/

Not sure if anyone is following, but nerfs got a power-up and can now render at 1080p @ 200 fps
[2023-08-30, 02:20:48] ~ Chinmay Talegaonkar: It’s not a NeRF. 
It uses differentiable rasterization, and Ellipsoidal weighting averages to render points, not ray marching like NeRFs. Also it doesn’t really capture the radiance field of a scene, so you can’t get meshes / dense depths from 3D Gaussians yet. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-08-30, 02:41:21] Dev Aggarwal: Differenciable rasterisation sounds very cool. Share deets?
[2023-08-30, 02:43:38] ~ Chinmay Talegaonkar: Are you familiar with the volume rendering image formation model used by NeRFs? - color accumulated along a ray is a linear combination of colors predicted at points on the ray. The weights are proportional to the predicted density and accumulated transmittance. Turns out you will get a very similar alpha compositing equation if you try to rasterizer points with opacities modeled through a Gaussian distribution. The covariance of the Gaussian, the color, and the location of the points can be optimized, that’s where the differentiable part comes from. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-08-30, 03:04:30] Dev Aggarwal: Got it, so the part where they’re able to sort the gaussians at a certain depth instead of having to do individual ray marching is what makes this fast?
[2023-08-30, 03:07:53] Dev Aggarwal: And because the optimisation is on the rasterised 2d image, you can’t make it output a true mesh

[2023-08-30, 09:26:21] ~ Chinmay Talegaonkar: Yes, roughly. Mainly it’s because the notion of continuous opacity in case of 3D Gaussians exists only in the 2D image space, unlike NeRFs

[2023-09-01, 11:37:03] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: A question:

If I am generating lots of images (say 10k per batch) from SD with minor variations. What are some good quality check techniques? You know like it’s written on every site that 1-2 out of every 5 images may not be usable. 

For mass production can’t choose. Have to produce, check for some errors (more checks the better) and send. 

Any pointers 🙏
[2023-09-01, 11:38:02] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I did last year with 30k images and team manually shorted out.
[2023-09-01, 11:40:35] Ankur Pandey: May use a data annotation company
[2023-09-01, 11:42:12] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: What do you mean by quality defines a lot of things. Is it aesthetic quality, is it prompt adherence, is it some other kind of adherence?
[2023-09-01, 11:43:33] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Yeah those are always an option. But that wont work at volume and near real-time push we are researching into.

So, asking if there are non human content moderation / quality check techniques 

- prompt adherence
- mangled images (person in the middle of car type diffusion errors)
- out painting going out of logic (pun intended)

Not bad hands and all.
[2023-09-01, 11:45:45] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: So we at Dashtoon are trying to build something similar to automatically remove “bad “ images.

Have been running experiments on clip score, aesthetic score and there was a repo I forgot that even gave a heat map of image to prompt my region. Planning to use a mix of them on this. This is still early for us too.
[2023-09-01, 11:48:54] Kunal Bhatia Hexo: At hexo, we've built some classifiers to score images across different parameters and auto filter the ones below a certain threshold
[2023-09-01, 11:50:26] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Yea. This seems the logical next step for us too
[2023-09-01, 11:55:59] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Link to repo pls?
[2023-09-01, 12:00:26] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: https://github.com/castorini/daam
I assume it's this repo
[2023-09-01, 12:11:54] Kishore GenAI: @917407651462 did you guys try the Visual QA based models? And have a template of questions for getting answers? For example, if the prompt has human, then ask how many fingers are present in the hand of the human in the image?
[2023-09-01, 12:12:54] Kishore GenAI: Or at an even simpler level, find the faults with this image
[2023-09-01, 12:26:26] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Yesss
[2023-09-01, 12:26:59] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: That’s actually a good idea we haven’t tried yet. @916000705207  😋
[2023-09-01, 12:27:33] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: What's the best api or model for enhancing the audio?
[2023-09-01, 13:16:18] Kishore GenAI: Some other ideas alone the same front, some AI ish and others not.
1. If there is a human, and the request was full body, and you want to check if it is full body, can we use openpose on the output image and check if all the lines are present.(media pipe hands also can be used to check for fingers)
2. If there are specific objects requested in the output, can we use segmentation maps or object detection models to identify if they indeed present in the output.
3. Generate questions based on the prompt, which can be check and based on the answer further questions can be developed, which can then be used to check the output using VQA models. Incase of an error, flag it. Example, a table missing a leg in the view.

My understanding is that visual identification models can be used instead of scoring to figure out bad images. Scoring though good, are slightly narrow in the realm they operate at. By ensuring that prompt being fed into the input, the aspects of the image which need to be checked, would actually be checked.

Did the clean up and transitions manually. I wanted to use AI generated video but prices are too high right now for us but once something usable/offline alternatives comes, would love to combine this automation with GenAI for video. https://youtu.be/tjkIASRorQs?si=YtSrHzdMVbYsKiDQ

[2023-09-02, 15:48:43] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Was having a lot of issues with sdxl in painting on a larger canvas. There was a GitHub open issue as well. (thanks Kishore for pointing that). Used a workaround from that thread which effectively used guidance scale for noise like auto1111

If someone has solved it more elegantly then please DM 🙏🙈
[2023-09-02, 23:12:10] Ayush Yadav: One popular mainstream artist released a song last year I guess.
[2023-09-02, 23:14:00] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Can you share some resources to this?
[2023-09-03, 09:55:14] Hasan Tech Art: Sure. The process starts with a few keywords used to search for videos, I have connected the APIs for pexels and pixabay and a multithreaded downloader. There is a premiere pro script from AEscripts which takes a music folder and video folder, does beat detection and auto video alignment. If you want to develop something on your own, should be possible with Moviepy + Pymiere. The biggest benefit of premiere is the library of transitions which I already have. Looking into automating transitions next. For audio reactive things, I might have to connect touchdesigner into the mix to get some serious reactivity.

[2023-09-04, 12:27:06] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Looked at the paper. It's good when you have decent enough sample size. That's why google released their beta with large brands with who they can get decent input images. Doing it with 1-2 images and targetting SMBs (my madness!) / shopify sellers is a real challenge.
[2023-09-04, 12:33:04] Nirant K: @6590690114 I suspect we discussed this when I met — the mechanics of GenAI across domains favours large enterprises at higher quality and control or user sets (e.g. SMBs, consumers) which are okay with 60-80% of ideal at 5-10x speeds

Good to see you here. Tapan @919158540496 could help here 😀
[2023-09-05, 13:10:15] Kishore GenAI: can you define (a) more in detail?
[2023-09-05, 13:12:46] Sudharshan GenAI: 1. lora + inpaint 
2. roop
[2023-09-05, 16:48:02] Abhishek Maiti: Just curious what is Roop?
[2023-09-05, 16:48:33] Amogh V: A pretty good face swap
[2023-09-05, 16:49:02] ~ Tapan: It's a Face swap for A1111
[2023-09-05, 16:50:49] ~ Tapan: Have you tried InsightFace with Midjourney?

Or, Vary(Region) on Midjourney
[2023-09-05, 16:58:19] ~ Amrit: Does a pretty good imo, have used face swap with MJ
[2023-09-05, 17:00:57] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: Let's say it is an image of a flat's balcony with grills, and I can give prompts to place a human character in a way that seems to stand behind the grills (so intelligence of depth etc.).

Then the other aspect of this if I can supply my own human character vs. a famous character. I guess this is fairly doable today.
[2023-09-05, 17:01:05] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: Yes, been using InsightFace @919158540496 but will check out Vary(Region)
[2023-09-05, 17:02:00] ~ Tapan: Make sure your 'remix' mode is switched on before using Vary(Region)
[2023-09-05, 17:02:59] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: The question is more around reliable, quick TAT & ideally uncapped usage tools. For example, Photopea is pretty solid with basic Face Swap but only for popular human characters.
[2023-09-05, 17:04:28] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: Apologies for the noob questions though, I am sure people have shared all this here over past few months. Just that it is not my primary focus w.r.t. genAI.
[2023-09-05, 17:06:33] Sudharshan GenAI: Lora + inpainting / dreambooth + inpainting

[2023-09-05, 17:33:33] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: This is nice any other resources
[2023-09-05, 17:35:13] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: It sometimes generate misspelling
 How are you fixing it
[2023-09-05, 17:35:22] Sudharshan GenAI: Oliver Darla’s on YouTube
[2023-09-05, 17:35:29] Sudharshan GenAI: Sarkas*
[2023-09-05, 17:59:07] Ayush Yadav: by retying it

[2023-09-06, 10:18:21] Kishore GenAI: The intelligence of the depth doesn't exist. The one you are thinking of is inpainting, with one issue that anything you inpaint will be newer, and hence if the grill needs to be exact, you will need to have a way to mask an area of a human, and then add the grill on back on top of it. Might look fake, and will require a lot of retrials

but on the other hand, if base inpainting is all you need, you can achieve it with inpainting + controlnet openpose. They are present in A1111.

[2023-09-10, 20:00:53] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Yes had seen this. Is it an API call to an implementation of the same?
[2023-09-10, 20:01:26] ~ Krishnan: No no. I am trying to implement it myself. They are not launched yet.

[2023-09-12, 18:47:24] Ayush Yadav: What is an ideal way to deploy stable diffusion with control nets on aws. ( Serverless) 

I have got 1000$ AWS credits today. 

So I want to use that instead of paying hugging face, replicate or other service.

I know sage maker can do base models, but what about with control nets.
[2023-09-12, 18:54:37] Ayush Yadav: @919971004124 any idea?
[2023-09-12, 18:55:14] Kunal Bhatia Hexo: @919480391910 can help

[2023-09-12, 18:57:10] Nirant K: ik that's why I pinged S
[2023-09-12, 23:25:00] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: @917999896920 serverless likely sagemaker is best bet.
[2023-09-13, 02:45:46] Dev Aggarwal: Any limitations around gpu, runtime, docker image size etc we should know about?
[2023-09-13, 02:58:40] Ayush Yadav: Cold start time is one
[2023-09-13, 02:59:27] Ayush Yadav: Ya I was trying with that only, need to request for GPU from AWS first.

[2023-09-13, 14:32:21] Shagun Sood 2014G: Sagemaker serverless does not work with GPU instances
[2023-09-13, 14:32:50] Gaurav MonsterAPI Qblocks: +1
[2023-09-13, 14:46:56] Ayush Yadav: 😶 so how can one make a serverless api for StableDiffusion on aws??

You must run an instance 24/7 ?
[2023-09-13, 15:12:55] Shagun Sood 2014G: What’s the idea you have in mind? Just deploy SD on aws and play around with it? 
Or will it have some user traffic? ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-09-13, 15:17:11] ~ dhruv: Hope someone here suggests a better solution
But what I had done to solve the serverless issue is to make it as queue, instead of a API endpoint - this allowed for 0 to 1 scaling. aws has Batch which can do this
But again, not an ideal way to do it
[2023-09-13, 15:26:56] Ayush Yadav: User image -> Super hero image 

Wanna share it with my friends. 

Using Stable Diffusion + the new IP adapter control net

So if it's not serverless then I have to run it 24/7 & then It wouldn't make any sense. 


I was okay with cold start time as people can wait 1 minute if it's something cool
[2023-09-13, 15:27:54] Dev Aggarwal: Just use replicate na, it will be open for others also 😃
[2023-09-13, 15:27:56] Ayush Yadav: For playing around I used to use Google Collab, it works rarely now days. 
Running A1111 repo gives warning, gets disconnected automatically.
[2023-09-13, 15:28:09] Ayush Yadav: I have AWS credits.
[2023-09-13, 15:28:40] Ayush Yadav: I applied for startup program using one of my old products, I got 1000 credits.
[2023-09-13, 15:29:14] Shagun Sood 2014G: Got it 
You can use AWS lambda functions to start and stop a sagemaker endpoint 
There is no server less solution out there by AWS but you can build one using lambda functions
[2023-09-13, 15:29:41] Shagun Sood 2014G: I am assuming there won’t be a lot of traffic initially so should be good for 1000 simultaneous requests
[2023-09-13, 15:29:59] Ayush Yadav: Ya I was reading about it yesterday too, I'll find something surely.

I have seen people host llama 2 serverless & make api
[2023-09-13, 15:32:09] Ayush Yadav: Make sense why startups providing serverless stable diffusion exist. 

Otherwise people have to figure something out themselves.
[2023-09-13, 15:33:11] Shagun Sood 2014G: We at Hexo are doing something similar. All our models are deployed on sagemaker in a serverless fashion
[2023-09-13, 15:34:00] Ayush Yadav: I'll connect with you if I have doubts. Thanks👍
[2023-09-13, 15:34:57] ~ dhruv: Using lambda to orchestrate sagemaker endpoints?
[2023-09-13, 15:35:34] Shagun Sood 2014G: Yes
[2023-09-13, 15:56:40] Dev Aggarwal: Learn k8s and celery, will pay you in dividends + when you eventually wanna move to other cloud its simple
[2023-09-13, 15:57:48] Ayush Yadav: I know basic k8s, I have deployed GPT 4 slack bot at dashtoon using that. worked on celery code base, but didn't use it, so need to learn that
[2023-09-13, 15:58:52] Ayush Yadav: like writing github action to deploy to k8s, making logging pipline etc.
[2023-09-13, 16:41:29] Dev Aggarwal: dont need to complicate stuff with github actions ig, but the celery queue will help you do autoscaling and is generally more reliable for this stuff than http
[2023-09-13, 16:49:18] Ayush Yadav: Got it.

The GitHub action was for, 
as soon as I commit my changes to the repo.

Automatically new container image of the bot will be created, uploaded to azure container registry then deployed to k8s cluster.
[2023-09-13, 16:50:25] Dev Aggarwal: very nice, github actions was able to build those huge ass nvidia/cuda images?
[2023-09-13, 16:50:55] Ayush Yadav: No slack bot for gpt 4 .

It was using gpt 4 api
[2023-09-13, 16:51:46] Dev Aggarwal: yeah github actions will probably choke under the load of a cuda image
[2023-09-13, 16:52:59] Ayush Yadav: Probably, haven't tried
[2023-09-13, 16:56:44] ~ dhruv: This is what Batch does on aws, wrapper over all of this. But yeah, long term and cost perspective makes sense to use own queues and k8s

[2023-09-20, 13:34:39] Sharwon Pius: An example is; https://huggingface.co/stabilityai/control-lora . This approach is specifically related to reducing the size of exsisting controlnet model. Unlike contorlnet-xs, where size reduction is not based on low rank  adaptation.
If you using controlnets in prod, this can help in reducing inference time.

just like few months back, the first QR code images were probably made using some basic controlnet model and then later someone trained the QR Monster for better adaptability to qr patterns. 

am i getting this right?
[2023-09-23, 01:22:03] Ambika Computational Mama: I mean it might not do anything greater than what’s currently possible. It’s just a simply well trained on high threshold b/w images. But yes what is still kind of vague is how it interacts with the prompt - same settings and different creates very different results. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-10-13, 22:33:01] Vignesh Baskaran: Possible reasons:
1. Make sure your dictionary of input and output image names are mapped correctly upfront
2. Could be some multithreading mishap. Check if you are doing multithreading anywhere
3. If you are batch processing the inputs make sure you are batching them properly
4. *If you are using Flask or even direct Streamlit to serve then set num of workers to 1*
5. If none of these work, process each user sequentially

I think the boldened one is the issue if you are using Flask ‎<This message was edited>

but when lots of request come at same time ,
you have a race condition , different request returning same file, so people were getting different outputs

[2023-10-14, 00:50:59] Ayush Yadav: One question?
What kind of input should I ask from user for generating the superhero image.
Like the name of superhero ? Pose ?

I am taking random prompts & pose here. 
Wanted to reduce friction as people are lazy to input anything. 

+ People can do prompt injection , if I give them an open field. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-14, 00:54:40] Divya Tak: Have sample images as poses that people can choose from (in the back you can have text suffix to the prompt for pose)
[2023-10-14, 00:55:04] Divya Tak: Users arent lazy, they don't know what they will get so they have little incentive to try
[2023-10-14, 00:56:53] Divya Tak: When making products it's helpful to keep in mind that "users are stupid/lazy/bored/unaware" is all an amateur product maker's language. 

No one owes anyone attention. And it is presumptuous to assume that people should give your product attention if you haven't made it clear for them why they should use it.
[2023-10-14, 00:57:45] Divya Tak: For super hero you might wanna think about categories of examples. Look like "superman, Batman, Goku, Neo from Matrix " etc. Whatever are the limits of your model
[2023-10-14, 00:57:56] Divya Tak: So that one would know what can they prompt with.
[2023-10-14, 00:58:26] Ayush Yadav: Got it.
[2023-10-14, 01:00:45] Ayush Yadav: Yes, that's wrong way to think about that. 

I actually made an app for college students. 

& In bio they didn't knew what to write. So instead I added options they can select for details instead of writing them. 

From there I learnt to reduce friction as people get overwhelmed by what to write in a blank space .
[2023-10-14, 01:01:09] Divya Tak: Reduction of friction is one way of doing it
[2023-10-14, 01:01:21] Divya Tak: Making the other side feel more interesting is another way
[2023-10-14, 01:01:28] Divya Tak: Primarily how product design works
[2023-10-14, 01:01:35] Divya Tak: Primarily how game design works
[2023-10-14, 01:01:45] Divya Tak: Doing a mix of both is helpful
[2023-10-14, 01:10:00] Ayush Yadav: Noted
[2023-10-14, 01:11:10] Divya Tak: Ofc all of these are rough thoughts. But asking yourself if I showed this to my mom, where would she get stuck
[2023-10-14, 01:11:18] Divya Tak: And then try and eliminate those stuck points
[2023-10-14, 01:11:32] Divya Tak: If you have a particularly tech savvy mom then maybe someone else
[2023-10-14, 01:11:34] Divya Tak: 😂😂
[2023-10-14, 06:27:59] ~ Sid: you should use 2 options either drop-downs with text values or image tiles, one with name of super hero other with pose.

[2023-10-21, 15:40:16] ~ Abhilash K Pai: Something like this?
[2023-10-21, 15:41:30] ~ Abhilash K Pai: Copy pasted this in chat gpt with dalle mode
[2023-10-21, 16:20:38] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: They are better because they get the context of surrounding other insects but it can be improved further to add the emotions or make the character more human like
[2023-10-21, 16:21:18] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: What's this , let me check it
[2023-10-21, 18:29:20] Vamshi: I’ve always had this question, is it possible to make a diffusion model render all the semantically different parts of the image as layers?
[2023-10-21, 18:29:43] Vamshi: Is this possible in any tool or even a collab or script ?
[2023-10-21, 18:31:44] Vamshi: Like having each ant above , the spider and it’s clothes as separate layers
[2023-10-21, 18:33:03] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: There are methods like multidiffusion; gligen
[2023-10-21, 18:33:24] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: But they are not really perfect. You can get some level of compositional control with them
[2023-10-21, 18:38:34] Vamshi: Oh ok
[2023-10-21, 18:38:41] Vamshi: Anything via A1111 ?
[2023-10-21, 18:41:28] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: I think the closest you can get in a1111 is latent couple which is not as good....
There is a workflow for gligen on comfy though
[2023-10-21, 18:41:31] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: https://comfyanonymous.github.io/ComfyUI_examples/gligen/
[2023-10-21, 18:42:30] Vamshi: Similarly, is it possible to get GPT4V to generate a procedural approximation for an input image ?
I tried to prompt it to generate javascript code for the HTML canvas instead of the English description that it usually outputs, it went nowhere.
[2023-10-21, 18:43:08] Vamshi: Basically I was trying to get it to “draw” the input image using code but not just output an array of pixels
[2023-10-21, 18:43:59] Vamshi: I made prompts like can you output JavaScript code which approximates this image with an array of coloured bezier splines etc
[2023-10-21, 18:44:30] Vamshi: It kept saying something like “this is too hard”
[2023-10-21, 18:45:08] Vamshi: Maybe this kind of thing needs a fine tuning
[2023-10-21, 18:45:20] Vamshi: May not be a prompting kind of thing
[2023-10-21, 18:45:27] ~ Prasad: You mean like that ancient vector graphics?
[2023-10-21, 18:45:51] Vamshi: Like what programmers in the demoscene would do
[2023-10-21, 18:47:15] Vamshi: Little code snippets that exploit symmetries and regularities and approximate the image with a small loop of code + an array of data
[2023-10-21, 18:47:28] Vamshi: But GPT gave me some ideas to do this
[2023-10-21, 18:48:05] Vamshi: It said since the deeper layers would have “higher” concepts in the image it would have to write code that has a loop for each layer in the model
[2023-10-21, 18:48:23] Vamshi: It said I can give you these ideas but I can’t write any code by 😄
[2023-10-21, 18:50:19] Vamshi: Nested loops that is

[2023-10-23, 14:55:23] Ayush Yadav: I created a Python backend that runs Stable Diffusion XL & does Inpainting. 

( Also supports other models like SD 1.5 )

Prompt + Image + Coordinates -> Inpainted Area

It's dockerized too.

I think it would be helpful to people starting out with writing their own image generation code.

Instead of relying on A1111 backend API.

Here's the repo:

[2023-11-03, 12:40:02] ~ Surya: one point to note, i passed two prompts, so it would take less time if i only passed one prompt
[2023-11-03, 12:40:25] Kishore GenAI: how is the editability of this? Can you change the tiger to leapord and get very similar video out?
[2023-11-03, 12:40:39] ~ Surya: yes yes
[2023-11-03, 12:40:40] Kishore GenAI: Something like inpainting, where only part of the image needs to be updated.
[2023-11-03, 12:41:55] ~ Surya: we can also change image of leopard into video using the img2video model
[2023-11-03, 12:44:35] Kishore GenAI: Suppose i want to show two shots, one is the video you sent above, and the other is night time, with rain, can I do that?. Then would the placement of trees, the camera angle grass and other items placed exactly where they are. 

The reason for rain and night time, is specifically to ask about changes to lighting, as well as rain affects every single pixel in every frame of the video, so inpainting wont work on it.  Any idea on this?
[2023-11-03, 12:52:49] Kishore GenAI: Asking cause I had this question for quite some time now. Getting videos to work for professional settings ( product ads and movies) without getting inputs on roles which exist now seems very difficult to pull off.  

In Nvidia marbles bts, they spoke about how they had a texture of expert, a layout expert, a modelling expert, lighting expert to work together to create their video. And this was in 3D using Nvidia omniverse.
[2023-11-03, 12:54:46] Kishore GenAI: I also saw a tweet from Amit founder of Luma labs where he states: "The core belief at Luma is that all visual generative models need to reason and work in 3d to make videos, scenes, and worlds that look plausible and are useful."  Link: https://twitter.com/gravicle/status/1719854271322280235?s=20
[2023-11-03, 12:56:43] Kishore GenAI: So the question is, how much control can video generation models provide and when can we expect more granular controls? Any ideas on this?
[2023-11-03, 13:13:33] Vamshi: This makes so much sense. Rendering directly to video and bypassing the 3D pipeline seems like brute force, atleast at first glance.
[2023-11-03, 13:18:41] Vamshi: I’m guessing it’s all the legal stuff that’s preventing companies like Epic from not providing these tools already
[2023-11-03, 13:19:41] Vamshi: The game industry used to be the earliest adopters of new tech, but now they’re super wary of all the legal ramifications and don’t want to touch any Gen AI.
[2023-11-03, 13:20:48] Kishore GenAI: Infinigen is a procedural generator of 3D scenes, developed by Princeton Vision & Learning Lab. Infinigen is optimized for computer vision research and generates diverse high-quality 3D training data. Infinigen is based on Blender

https://youtu.be/6tgspeI-GHY
[2023-11-03, 13:44:18] ~ Prasad: Multi scene, video, worlds, agree. Single images for example ads, not sure, seems like overkill for that use case
[2023-11-03, 13:47:51] Kishore GenAI: It wont be images, it will be video based ads. The constraint was always the time and cost. It takes roughly 16 seconds to create one single frame, and we need 24 frames per second. Typical charges of 3d product animation ranges from USD 25 to USD 1000 per second of animation, depending on complexity of the scenes. This is couple of orders of magnitude higher in price point than images.

Among the dangers of AI is that LLMs dual-trained on code and biology could enable computer viruses to jump to DNA substrate.  Imagine getting a cold that compromises your immune system and makes it start mining Bitcoin

[2023-11-06, 09:51:16] Karan Ganesan luma.ai: Hey Folks!
good morning

Earlier last week, my team at Luma AI launched Genie, a new 3d foundation model in research preview capable of generating 3D models in seconds, highly useful for creatives to build amazing concepts / experiences without knowledge of any 3D modelling 

https://x.com/LumaLabsAI/status/1719792922646987152

Thought folks from this group would be interested in this, hence sharing (lmk if not), also if anyone has any feedback or comments or any feedback on UI/UX of the tool, viewer, etc. or anything feel free to reach out to me as it’s early preview. 

Available today on our Discord with just /genie
[2023-11-06, 10:14:03] ~ Chinmay Talegaonkar: I tried it last week it’s pretty good! Is there a plan to move it out of discord at some point into a stand alone app?

[2023-11-07, 23:38:04] Shashwat TDC: This look great. I was thinking about it, commentators are known for their on the fly creativity. Wud be really mind-blowing if AI can navigate such a complex and unpredictable task real-time.
[2023-11-08, 00:38:48] Ojasvi Yadav: Would require lots of compute, but possible with a slight delay of like 15 seconds. So the stream would run 15 seconds behind to make breathing rooms for the commentary to generate.
[2023-11-08, 00:39:52] Ojasvi Yadav: Also can be heavily optimised by the approach I described in the tweet. We don't have to use all the frames at all the times to generate commentary. Just need it during key moments like delivery, shot and outcome of the shot.
[2023-11-08, 00:41:06] Shashwat TDC: True. Instead of replacing, you can think of augmenting.

tldr: Needed advice on creating in-shop product images from user-product images. Naively, it involves three steps - segmentation, view-rotation and refinement/inpainting.

Lately I was trying to extract/create in-shop product images from user generated content. I am attaching image for reference, here it's fashion but it can be any product. I have tried following things which didn't work.

1. Fetching public data related to it, getting clip embeddings and then nearest search using FAISS. Got decent results with fine-tuned embeddings from CLIP but precision was poor, sometimes best result was 3rd/5th image from similarities. 
2. Improved on above by getting just segmented out section along with textual description but still the same results.
3. Tried ControlNet diffusion, able to capture texture but failing in text and edges/smoothness. Sometimes it's not even any product. 
4. Tried DALLE, but it refuses to extract user content directly, does very good job at generating similar content. 🤦‍♂️
5. Trained custom U-Net by creating input output pairs but it was worst of all.
6. Tried looking directly for product in Google Vision API for product which works great, but cost and not all product are available. 

Preferably, I am looking for generative models to cater diversity.

Basically I had a query regarding a few stuff I'm trying to learn better and formulate. Here are the questions:

1. So what is a solution to deepfakes regarding content moderation?
2. Any good ideations / insights derived in Indian startups scenes similar to https://detectfakes.media.mit.edu/ for videos and images ? ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-15, 10:52:33] Ayush Yadav: I know about Prometheus, I was thinking to avoid the complexity. Is there any SAAS with free tier that does that?
[2023-11-15, 10:52:55] Ayush Yadav: Like we have Firebase for auth & db etc. Free upto a limit type
[2023-11-15, 10:54:37] Ambika Computational Mama: @918890571387 and Denny from tattle were working on this
[2023-11-15, 10:55:10] Ambika Computational Mama: they were making a game i think
[2023-11-15, 10:55:39] Ambika Computational Mama: there is also a company (dont know if indian) that was working on misinformation games
[2023-11-15, 11:01:37] Sumit Swiggy : Prometheus Clients collect data, they dont need separate store, they store data locally.
But if you restart the webserver the metrics would be lost.
for long term storage you need a data store. 

Since he seems to be doing PoC i suggested Prometheus client.
[2023-11-15, 11:07:19] Ayush Yadav: Got it. I have built logging Pipeline before. Time to work on metrics now.
[2023-11-15, 11:09:18] Sumit Swiggy : You may check the reply I gave to Nirant.

If you need long term storage then only go for SaaS, otherwise prometheus client is the best option. It’s just a python client library which stores data locally on disk.
[2023-11-15, 11:12:17] Ayush Yadav: Ya I read it already. Will look more into it, when I get back to it.

[2023-11-15, 23:11:07] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yes will check out , what I've noticed in my experiments of whisper is that latency can be slow often and it needs lot of gpu to run inferences fast for real-time captioning. 

need to play around more to get it to latency levels seen in google / msft captioning for their tools at-least for English.
[2023-11-15, 23:17:56] ~ Prateek🖤: But you could have used DALLE out of the box through Azure OpenAi or any similar offering with prompting "turn and uploaded image of Male/female person to a superhero" and return the output on your streamlined webapp right?
[2023-11-15, 23:18:02] ~ Prateek🖤: Just wondering...

[2023-11-15, 23:18:56] ~ Prateek🖤: In case you have the code available on GitHub with some licensing for the app, I would love to dig deeper if it sounds fine with you.
[2023-11-15, 23:19:26] Ayush Yadav: Can you just get the face of the person easily with DALL E?
[2023-11-15, 23:20:20] ~ Prateek🖤: It should be possible. I haven't experimented much with it personally, as I am mostly into unstructured data ( documents ) universe but I would suggest you to give it a try as well
[2023-11-15, 23:20:44] Ayush Yadav: I'll like to make a product out of it. 

Once I can run it at cheap cost.
[2023-11-15, 23:26:11] ~ Prateek🖤: 😂😂

I understand.

But if you plan to turn it to a product or a SaaS offering:

1. I feel if you experiment with Dalle a bit and if it helps you achieve your goal then it should be simpler to setup, maintain, scale and better manage the entire system design and infra.
2. I am assuming if you are using some out of the box APIs for stable diffusion for achieving this then you can do a cost analysis of the same with self hosting the service on azure/GCP ( won't recommend aws ) as it turns to be cost effective.
3. Implement rate limiters for cost handling and maybe an API gateway at a later stage if it reaches such scale.
4. Caching to improve latency.
5. Dockerize the app, and host it in a container behind the UI which can be on sleep mode if someone doesn't access the service every 30 mins ( you can tweak this parameter ).
[2023-11-15, 23:26:20] ~ Prateek🖤: Sorry, for spamming 😂
[2023-11-15, 23:27:38] Ayush Yadav: What are you building @918826549607 ?
[2023-11-15, 23:30:18] ~ Prateek🖤: A bit off topic ...

But,

Currently trying to build an end to end large scale document processing pipeline ( entities extraction plus abstractive summarisation ) in our enterprise setup.

The entities extraction piece is largely subjective as per the biz. Requirements so I am trying to use GPT and other similar variants to make it generic.

https://x.com/tldraw/status/1724892287304646868?s=46&t=icC0fizZK8E3ONsDVuGFWA

At core it just makes an API call to GPT-4V and asks it to output a html file.You can check the code on GitHub.Their prompt seems pretty simple too.

But I really like the way how they’ve integrated it in the workflow of creating wireframes and mock-ups.

[2023-11-23, 06:01:25] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Curious question: Given the huge amount of compute and processing time needed (2min for a 2 second clip?) what’s the short to mid term use case for generative video?

For generative images, it was still acceptable time and cognitive workload is lower. So, it has become acceptable. Video of course the time needed to make a short clip will reduce over time but quality expectation bar is also higher. But, what
[2023-11-23, 06:01:42] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: what’s the real use case in say next 3-6 months. Genuinely trying to understand
[2023-11-23, 08:43:39] Nirant K: It's fun. It's pretty. Both are very strong use cases for doing anything!
[2023-11-23, 08:43:57] ~ Anjineyulu: We can monetize on ads may be for now
[2023-11-23, 08:46:49] ~ Error 404!: Generative videos can be used for creating creative ads
[2023-11-23, 08:53:47] ~ Pankaj Chawla: A typical animated video costs anywhere from $100 to $80000 for a 1 minute clip. At the lower end, it takes about 4 weeks, and on the top end, it takes about 4-6 months using current processes. The question to answer is how these numbers will change with the use of GenAI.
[2023-11-23, 08:57:26] Hari Balasubramanian: I got a 70 sec  video done using AI images , videos , and canned video clips  in 24 hours and for $200.
[2023-11-23, 09:04:53] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Thanks everyone. So, animated ads is the main use case? Anything else apart from Nirant’s it’s cute to play with theory :)

Some other ideas I have heard are - use the AI generated videos to feed into stockimage/video library for use by others.

Videos we all know intutively is huge TAM, time complexity, and too many options that scare people into making one. Wondering how AI videos really fit in given creation takes so much time, editing back n forth to get what you want will take even longer (unless of course stock footage doesn’t exist or too expensive like fresh from scratch animated ads)
[2023-11-23, 09:05:24] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: This was manually stitched together? Why not use some existing tools like invideo to stitch together a solution for 2$?
[2023-11-23, 09:09:27] Hari Balasubramanian: The script required quick turnaround and manual intervention was necessary . It was to create a MVP such that concept could be explained to developers easily .

[2023-11-23, 17:12:27] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: What kind of software do restaurants have for placing there menu on food delivery apps? Is it possible to create something like dynamic image for restaurants with genAI to optimize for sales?
[2023-11-23, 17:19:48] ~ Ashish: Afaik different apps have different specs, hence merch is handled by an outsourced team for each platform initially for QC after restos upload images when onboarded - at this stage there is some genAI tools available for the team to use. That’s then again approved by resto. POS/integration apps like urbanpiper do not take care of merch integration. This might change with ONDC down the line when merchants need to just get onboarded once and then marketplaces can use merch from there.
[2023-11-23, 17:23:42] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Is there scope for restaurants to do dynamic image and pricing with ondc?

[2023-11-23, 18:23:44] Ojasvi Yadav: A b2b project could be changing the lighting of the dishes based on the lighting around a particular customer...
[2023-11-23, 18:34:12] Ojasvi Yadav: Dynamic pricing doesn't work in India that much since people just go to the merchant offering the lowest price...You don't want to invest in that problem statement if you're looking to optimise b2c unless you have a monopoly

[2023-11-24, 15:14:27] Divya Tak: hmm, so thats where my question is, if i am hungry, i will order something

[2023-11-24, 15:14:56] Divya Tak: keeping the ads part seperate
[2023-11-24, 15:20:46] Ojasvi Yadav: Agreed! Their search definitely uses semantic search on text. It is 100% possible to create an adjacent index of image embeddings, and order each triplet in the search results that maximises Manhattan distance between the image embeddings of the triplet.
[2023-11-24, 15:21:16] Ojasvi Yadav: That way even if you search for "burger", the results will be rearranged to ensure similar looking images aren't nearby

[2023-11-24, 15:35:35] Ojasvi Yadav: Intuitive primal recsys thinking -> give people more of what they've picked in the past

Real recsys problems with that -> recommendations get stale over time, and people get bored

Solution-> diverse results. It is fair to assume that people would want more of what they've consumed in the past. But like 10-20% of the times they're open to exploration. So your recsys recommendations should have space for diversity.
[2023-11-24, 15:38:07] Ojasvi Yadav: If you watch only cricket videos for 5 years on YouTube, it will still show you noncricket videos on your homepage. That is a good recsys. YouTube wasn't always like that. For media content, you need diversity. 

You don't need that much diversity on a platform like twitter. For example, right wingers don't want to see leftist content on their twitter homepage. And vice versa. So twitter that way keeps you in a bubble by low diversity in their recsys. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-26, 23:26:00] ~ YP: Your use case here is pretty legible though
[2023-11-26, 23:29:55] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: There is high abuse potential with a lot of emerging technologies, not discussing it (especially in a forum where i assume people are already familiar with it) doesn't really mitigate the abuse potential. As with any such cases, any discussion can only be conducted on the basis of "good faith" that it will not be misused.
[2023-11-26, 23:31:49] Divya Tak: You guys are welcome to discuss it on DM. there are 500+ members on here, 

I also think that a lot of times, these things are not harmful because they are used in bad faith, but because they are used without consideration.

[2023-12-08, 10:59:43] Shashwat TDC: Demo Drop Friday🪂⚡⚡

Hey guys, pls do check this 1 of few utility-apps I have released in last 4-months. I am bullish on 'wrappers-apps' and unique 'ux' for the tasks that humans always dreaded to work (e.g. writing sql query, creating video-variations etc.) In that sense these apps are not going to replace human-counterparts, but only fulfil the unfilled demand in market. But what happens when AGI arrives - idk.  

In this demo, we took another such problem - preparing for interviews! 
We all know interview prep for big techs is a super-long and dreading process. 
Right from creating resume to researching about the role, company etc. is a long funnel. Imagine all of that and more in 1-click. 

The portal is tested and live with the primary use-case. But there are some good-to-have things we are working on, hence we are offering it at a very small introductory price. Consider buying a premium plan to support. It will definitely add value (sharing the creative q/a in SS for my resume).

[2023-12-10, 00:06:26] Divya Tak: Hey! It would be helpful to talk about what kind of skills you're looking at/what does the collaborator need to bring to the table
[2023-12-10, 00:06:48] Divya Tak: That will give the folks in the community an idea about whether this is right for them
[2023-12-10, 00:07:49] ~ Abhigyan: Anyone who is invested in Stability Ai, stable diffusion and Runway ML is a good fit.
[2023-12-10, 00:32:43] Divya Tak: Hmm that doesn't clarify 😂😂
[2023-12-10, 00:32:57] Divya Tak: Do you want an engineer? Or an artist? Or a writer?

Script - chatgpt
Images - dalle
[2023-12-10, 22:24:24] Adithya S K PESIT: looks really cool 
quick question : did you use Dalle within Chatgpt+ or did you use Dalle API?
[2023-12-10, 22:31:09] ~ Vatsal chintalapati: Within gptplus
[2023-12-10, 22:31:22] ~ Vatsal chintalapati: Since the integrated update haven't been using dalle separately.
[2023-12-10, 22:31:50] ~ Vatsal chintalapati: Some things I have rendered, I now take from gpt and put into midjourney to edit specific sections if needed
[2023-12-10, 22:39:25] Adithya S K PESIT: there is good character and style consistency between the images
was wondering is it possible it do it with the api
[2023-12-10, 22:45:07] ~ Vatsal chintalapati: For the character and Conaistency, what I did was to first generate iterations of the first image and the Character setup, then ask gpt to show me the prompt for that image, then ask it to keep elements of that prompt in each I age and also keep telling it that character consistency has to be there. Was a bit of trial error but, happy with the results

[2023-12-13, 11:08:57] Shashwat TDC: these type of questions only create fomo and confusion. Pls avoid. For all kind of model access you need to apply on their website and they will send you access in email. Even if someone has access won't be able to share API key with you anyway.
[2023-12-13, 11:10:09] ~ Abhigyan: Agreed. Purpose here was to 
 get a demo animation with a specific prompt.
[2023-12-13, 11:14:39] Shashwat TDC: quite frankly, that's the only purpose for which anyone wud ask for such an access. 
My point is pls understand whatever is being showed in demos is not accessible to everyone, generally speaking. 
Better request would have been : how-to-questions 

i.e. how to get a demo animation for prompt x 

there are many ways to do a specific thing. Pika labs is not the only option, which seemed to be the case in ur earlier question. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-12-13, 13:48:42] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: Thanks for sharing, I guess we can think of it as levels of control one can have in the video generation process. Something like runway motion brush gives you more and SD-video for now is less.
[2023-12-13, 15:03:21] ~ Rohan Athawade: Hey all! 

I've been using SD inpainting recently, and I've found that it's a hit-or-miss situation. 

Sometimes, the area remains entirely unchanged, and at other times (esp while trying to place a new object somewhere) the changes don't blend with the background/surroundings well. 

What do y'all think? Has anyone faced similar issues with this? Would love to have a discussion.

We saw 100% jump in signup from our PH launch - with users spending 10-12 mins in their first-session on just the first interview round. These signals will help us build more conviction and add more value to it. Originally, I discovered this problem space when I was fired from glance and was assigned a outplacement agency - who did a great job in non-AI world. I think the experience was great (but not on-demand) which made me realise if more people had access to this kind of career guidance, it wud truly be impactful. I added the resume they created for my Director PM role on the site, for anyone who wants to check it out.

[2023-12-19, 13:59:25] ~ Kay Jey: @919550164716 

I m trying to make a RAG based llm model using lamam index and chat gpt 3.5 .

I wanna know if using a chat engine would mean, each time I ask the llm a new question, all the previous responses are being fed to it as prompt context , which means is the context window growing, iteratively ?
[2023-12-19, 14:07:15] Lucifer 😎: if you do find that your context window is growing, you might want to use SummaryMemory instead of BufferMemory for the same

I don't know what's the exact terminology in llamaindex
[2023-12-19, 16:11:06] Ravi Theja: Yes you are correct
[2023-12-19, 16:11:25] Ravi Theja: You can plugin those modules in chat engine
[2023-12-19, 16:37:28] Lucifer 😎: panchatantra is lingering in my mind looking at this
[2023-12-19, 16:42:06] ~ Kay Jey: How would that change the context window size ? 

I m looking into this mainly from the pov of cost.
[2023-12-19, 16:47:11] Lucifer 😎: Generally in ConversationSummaryBufferMemory, you take the summary of the previous conversation b/w AI and human ( generally called history ) and since the summaries are generally less in token size compared to the actual text - you there by save some token cost and prompt costs too

But, on hindsight, when you use this memory in your RAG, you need to additional call another *llm* which is responsible to create summary from the previous history
[2023-12-19, 16:47:23] Lucifer 😎: Maybe check this too

[2023-12-20, 13:25:51] ~ Rohan Athawade: I just tried it out! This model solves exactly what I've been trying to implement this week. 

So far, it seems like it works great with common objects, backgrounds and scenarios in general. However, it failed when I tested it out for more obscure objects and complex backgrounds. 

That being said, it seems the code is quite rudimentary and unclean as of right now. I assume (and hope) they're going to push a more stable and refined version soon.
[2023-12-20, 13:26:56] Sudharshan GenAI: Can you post examples?

[2023-12-20, 13:28:19] ~ Rohan Athawade: Another interesting thing I noted was that the model will deliberately fit the object to the size and shape of the mask you draw on the background image. I assumed that it would understand the size of the object/other related features intelligently and "inpaint" the rest of the space.
[2023-12-20, 13:28:54] ~ Rohan Athawade: Lastly, I faced LOTS of installation/package dependency issues 😅
[2023-12-20, 13:41:38] Sudharshan GenAI: you should open an issue on their github and give this feedback or open a pr directly

[2023-12-21, 09:19:02] Arvind N Generative AI Group: It takes under a minute to produce a somewhat coherent song clip. I'd say it's where midjourney was at the end of 2022. How long before we have community generated style LoRAs and control nets for audio?
What do you guys think?

Example: Bollywood dance song. Lyrics by chatGPT.

[2023-12-21, 09:30:36] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Does chatgpt get lyrics from an audio as well ?
[2023-12-21, 09:30:48] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Say a Bollywood song?
[2023-12-21, 09:51:19] Arvind N Generative AI Group: STT models can transcribe.
[2023-12-21, 10:00:56] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: even the music lyrics ? haven't seen that to be the case last I checked :O
[2023-12-21, 11:20:13] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: Last time I had tried it works decently well. Not perfect because of accents and styles but even some german songs were working well 😃
[2023-12-21, 11:22:58] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: Wow, this is really cool! Especially the part where it repeats the chorus just because there is a (Chorus) tag right. Amazing and fun ☺️

[2023-12-21, 12:57:09] Shubham Girdhar: The song sounds like the Hindi dubbed songs of South Indian movies
[2023-12-21, 14:28:11] Vamshi: Is it just voice transfer or singing voice - that’s a few steps ahead of what I thought we had
[2023-12-21, 14:44:52] Arvind N Generative AI Group: I asked chatGPT to make a Bollywood dance song lyrics in hinglish. Copy pasted into suno AI prompt and it turned it into the above song. It sounded ok-ish.
My question is how quickly can we get style LoRAs and control nets to improve the output.
[2023-12-21, 14:49:33] Vamshi: Haha I like how the bar is raised now, and we’re demanding full control 😄
[2023-12-21, 14:50:01] Vamshi: I had missed the singing voice synthesis going live part, this is impressive enough as is !!
[2023-12-21, 15:41:25] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: I remember that Suno first released a text to speech model but they had sound symbols as tokens from the start. So you would get some kind of humming etc. if you used certain tokens like ♪. But their text to speech itself was not as good as ElevenLabs at that time. I think they quickly pivoted to the music generation based on what the community was doing with their open-source models in their Discord.
[2023-12-21, 15:53:41] Vamshi: Singing voice is definitely the holy grail, start of something new!
[2023-12-21, 16:24:48] Ayush Yadav: This suno app is really on the uncanny valley.
[2023-12-21, 16:25:24] Shimanta Generative AI: Hey folks, I built this over the last couple of days, a spotify wrapped style analysis of your ChatGPT conversations over the year:
https://www.chatgptunwrapped.com/
[2023-12-21, 16:25:41] Ayush Yadav: I thought we could only generate music but the vocals are also good here
[2023-12-21, 16:25:49] Shimanta Generative AI: Currently only works on desktop due to the constraints around implementation
[2023-12-21, 16:27:39] Shimanta Generative AI: P.S. None of your conversation data is stored on any server, and it is free to use for now until I expire my openai credits :p ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-12-21, 16:29:29] Shimanta Generative AI: Also all the analysis is done only on the titles of your conversations and not the actual conversation itself, so it’s safe to use.
[2023-12-21, 16:34:41] Ayush Yadav: The suno ai output is bit distorted , any other services that could clean it?

Like I used to clean audio in audacity before. But something automated would be nice.
[2023-12-21, 16:51:37] Sudharshan GenAI: yup there are a few - ask in the creatives group? music production folks would know
[2023-12-21, 16:56:46] Sudharshan GenAI: I remember adobe having some cool tools

which doesn't sound monotonous.
[2023-12-21, 21:43:04] ~ Sid: can we improve the tone by first using TTS and then run it through some RVC voice model? or it will just change voice but it will remain monotonous?

[2023-12-21, 23:22:38] ~ Sid: mostly English, Hindi is a plus.
[2023-12-21, 23:24:22] Ayush Yadav: What do you mean? If I write text it won't be correct??

[2023-12-21, 23:36:05] Varshul Dubverse: The open source version is trained on unclean data from YouTube so it ends up giving hallucinations in the generated speech. Repetition, laughs in between, stuttering, etc is seen, even when you give a clean text.
[2023-12-21, 23:37:29] ~ YP: Seems undertrained
[2023-12-21, 23:38:36] Varshul Dubverse: You can try out coqui as well. It covers some more languages. There's a 365$ commercial licence. 

Would like to know what you're building so can suggest better.
[2023-12-22, 00:03:08] Amal David Futuryze: seamless m4t expressive is good as well but voice cloning was not there last I checked

You can talk to the codebase as you press Ctrl+ Enter 

Or have diffusers documentation in .md file

[2023-12-30, 00:06:02] Ayush Yadav: So I have to clone diffusers locally & ask.

Or in any of my projects I can pass diffusers link to it & get code completion?

[2023-12-30, 00:07:33] ~ YP: No hugging face has documentation 

You could experiment with say 3 pages saved in .md file

And just tag the .md file you need like @ and see it being used to start with

Creativity is the use of imagination or original ideas to create something. My sense is you are able to imagine these images before you craft a prompt. 

My question is what do you find most challenging in AI-art. 
In traditional art, I could argue it's the tooling know-how and muscle memory of drawing, painting etc. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-01-07, 04:51:57] Ayush Yadav: Hello Everyone, I have been writing a blog on -

How to build your First GenAI app with Stable diffusion?
& it's finally here🔥 

Tech Stack:
1. Python - Diffusers
2. Stable diffusion - v1.5
3. Controlnet - Canny

No API wrapper, we will be building from scratch using diffusers. 

Github for the FastAPI backend & Colab notebook links included.

Let me know your thoughts on this. Actually these are my learnings from building SuperheroAI. 
I thought I'll just document it.

[2024-01-07, 04:52:17] Ayush Yadav: @919447779903
[2024-01-07, 07:37:49] ~ YP: Kudos to putting that up! It's simple solution to get anyone started with diffusers ✨
[2024-01-07, 13:41:59] Ayush Yadav: Ya actually the idea was to build the full app backend & even deploy it serverless on replicate. 
But it was just getting too long, so I cut it short to be in Colab for now. 😅
[2024-01-07, 13:47:04] ~ Abhilash K Pai: Thank you for this 👍 I will follow the steps and try it out ..
[2024-01-07, 13:48:25] Ayush Yadav: Ya let me know if you think something is missing, or get stuck
[2024-01-07, 14:07:10] ~ Rohan Athawade: It would be great to see a follow-up article regarding this soon!
[2024-01-07, 14:08:30] Ayush Yadav: The backend/ streamlit code is on my GitHub. I have linked that in the conclusion part of it for now.
[2024-01-07, 14:16:32] Vignesh Baskaran: Ayush, amazing work! Looking very much forward to the article on Serverless deployment. It is the biggest painpoint for most people to get started! So looking very much forward to it
[2024-01-07, 14:21:08] Ayush Yadav: You helped me with 100$ replicate credits. That's the same one I am using for my testings 😅
[2024-01-07, 14:56:54] Vignesh Baskaran: ❤ Good luck Ayush! Fantastic work :)
[2024-01-08, 11:40:41] ~ Rohan Athawade: Hey guys, I had a general question regarding Stable Diffusion. What variant of SD in your opinion produces the most realistic looking images of people in a given scene? For example, people walking in a garden, wherein one singular person is not the focus of the whole image, but rather multiple people are to be generated in a scene where their anatomy is accurate and their faces are clearly visible.
[2024-01-08, 11:45:07] Shashwat TDC: This is a current limitation. Multiple images and faces is not solved yet. Technical reason is while denoising the image currently there is no first-class way to give more or less emphasis on one or the other subject. Hence output generation is hard to control. To put in perspective, even in digital camera, multiple face recognition and focus was introduced pretty recently. 

Once solved this will unlock usecases like wedding photography etc.
[2024-01-08, 13:05:35] Shashwat TDC: all consumer roads seems to converge at Zuck's metaverse. 💭
[2024-01-08, 20:21:36] ~ Adhish Thite: All, I put my office number in the community info by mistake, leaving this group for now, will re-join with my personal number.

[2024-01-11, 01:50:41] Ayush Yadav: I thought it was text to speech
[2024-01-11, 01:51:59] ~ Sid: i think it's RVC. i converted many songs into KK's voice using same.
[2024-01-11, 04:08:48] ~ cGh: GitHub ?
[2024-01-11, 08:24:35] Rahul Deora: Training Lora/Dreambooth or full fine tuning on your data
[2024-01-11, 09:03:57] ~ Manaswi: It has to be said after the advent of open source RVC and SOVITS models there are many tutorials and GUIs teaching voice cloning and even sharing popular voice models. If you plan to use this technology in your commercial projects, check with the publicity laws in your country. No place currently allows unlicensed voice conversion.
[2024-01-11, 09:56:07] Arvind N Generative AI Group: One option is making original songs and applying your own voice model.
step 1: generate lyrics with an LLM like chatgpt or bard
step 2: generate original songs in your fav genre on suno.ai
step 3: train your own voice model by using your speech data
step 4: convert the suno song into your voice
this is all a bit early but I see so much activity in this space. 2024 is going to be nuts.
[2024-01-11, 12:18:43] Shibangi Barua Budweiser Teetotaler: What voice models would you recommend, if you have tried any?
[2024-01-11, 12:38:05] Arvind N Generative AI Group: RVC
[2024-01-11, 12:44:17] Pratyush Choudhury: Does it make sense to have more of these steps consolidate on top of Suno.ai? 

@917407651462 told me that I am missing out on things in life because I had not really played w/ Suno & similar tools
[2024-01-11, 15:43:01] Ayush Yadav: Oh got it. Fine tuning then ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-11, 16:19:54] Arvind N Generative AI Group: I think so. Suno will try to stay within tight boundaries to avoid legal hassles. They'll only make "original" music. So naturally something is needed on top for differentiation.
[2024-01-11, 16:29:42] Divya Tak: soumyadeep wants to supercharge the maker in you :D
[2024-01-11, 16:31:21] Pratyush Choudhury: Haha… he’s kind enough to overestimate how good I am and underestimate how lazy I am

But I do have an aspiration to produce a movie sometime, AI just makes it easier
[2024-01-11, 16:31:56] Divya Tak: Ping whenever :D Now that i'm working as a creative producer on a movie i think maybe I can help too :P
[2024-01-11, 16:32:20] Pratyush Choudhury: Absolutely,
[2024-01-11, 19:29:22] Ayush Yadav: Damn, What are you making?
[2024-01-11, 19:29:53] Divya Tak: lol i'm a part of a feature film team :P I am not making anything by myself
[2024-01-11, 19:33:21] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: 🫣 mind if I DM? Need some advice regarding the field
[2024-01-11, 19:33:30] Divya Tak: sure!
[2024-01-11, 21:50:27] Arvind N Generative AI Group: Can I ask about insider views on the coming wave (Mustafa Suleyman's words) and early chatter?
[2024-01-11, 21:51:38] Divya Tak: I mean we're trying to use AI for a bunch of things but honestly it's good for reference purposes right now, but in production you basically need to setup a seperate pipeline
[2024-01-11, 21:51:47] Divya Tak: It's useful for concepting and reference
[2024-01-11, 21:51:59] Divya Tak: And speeding up some parts of vfx
[2024-01-11, 21:52:26] Divya Tak: But the lack of tweakability makes it hard. We're using luma for some 3d stuff which is quite cool
[2024-01-11, 21:52:49] Arvind N Generative AI Group: Would you say there's more optimism than fear and anxiety?
[2024-01-11, 21:53:31] Sailesh Sydelabs: So have you created a workflow of sorts? Different steps of production needing different tools?
[2024-01-11, 21:53:57] Arvind N Generative AI Group: This is definitely the thing that's coming afaik. What control nets did for images, is coming for audio and video. So many interesting projects are underway.
[2024-01-11, 21:54:18] Divya Tak: Not in our case. Just replacing some steps
[2024-01-11, 21:54:42] Divya Tak: I mean even with control net, the kind of precision you need is not there
[2024-01-11, 21:54:59] Divya Tak: Because then you have to compete with an artist who can actually paint something
[2024-01-11, 21:55:06] Divya Tak: And see whcih one is more efficient
[2024-01-11, 21:55:29] Divya Tak: Not just good at generating polished image but actually being close to vision
[2024-01-11, 21:55:52] Arvind N Generative AI Group: I hear you. Still early days.
[2024-01-11, 21:59:23] Divya Tak: Yea it's frustrating to try to get it to work and at that point efficiency gains aren't there much
[2024-01-11, 22:02:01] Arvind N Generative AI Group: This concern isn't unique. I'm hearing similar things in so many domains. We got extremely lucky that LLMs and genAI is exactly what our social companionship robots needed (in elderly care).
[2024-01-11, 22:43:27] Divya Tak: How are you using it
[2024-01-12, 18:50:47] Dr. Ashith Generative AI WA Group: Would be interested to know of the projects
[2024-01-12, 18:57:38] ~ Manaswi: For audio, many new papers about controlNet, musicNet and composition control on tokens for music. I recommend following harmonai / stability AI audio githubs and discord for the latest, if you aren't into reading papers
[2024-01-12, 19:42:29] Rahul Deora: Is there any paper implementing the same or similar ideas? I’ve worked on improving control nets and there are some unexplored ideas here

[2024-01-17, 20:04:49] Ayush Yadav: What do you mean by fine tuning here, 

For Hosting you need to make a cog project.
[2024-01-17, 20:06:27] ~ Krishnan: I am trying this..
https://replicate.com/lucataco/sdxl-lcm/train

Looks like it will work
[2024-01-17, 20:06:30] Ayush Yadav: You can get starter cog project. 

You have an entry point file there you create function that takes some inputs & returns the output. 

Hosting it is just uploading cog code from your GPU machine to replicate.
[2024-01-17, 20:06:45] Ayush Yadav: Ya just edit his code acc. To your needs

[2024-01-17, 20:23:41] Ambika Computational Mama: I tried this today with LoRA Ease - https://huggingface.co/computational-mama/tired-mom-octos with about 70ish images - im guessing you are paying for replicate train too - so may as well try this too
[2024-01-17, 20:23:51] Ambika Computational Mama: I dont know if you have seen this https://huggingface.co/blog/lcm_lora
[2024-01-17, 20:25:23] Ambika Computational Mama: https://huggingface.co/nerijs/pixel-art-xl and this one
[2024-01-17, 20:25:43] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: Depends on the use case. If you just want to make characters, then 40 images are more than sufficient (especially for SDXL). If you want to be able to make other stuff as well, then you will need atleast 100 images (varied subjects).
[2024-01-17, 20:26:18] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: Caption them well
[2024-01-17, 20:26:49] ~ Krishnan: I built the dataset using this one. But it's generic so, sometimes it doesn't give the right pose.
[2024-01-17, 20:27:33] ~ Krishnan: I am looking at a model that can make any character, real people, fictional characters, animals, aliens... But in resting pose in monochrome Bg
[2024-01-17, 20:28:47] ~ Krishnan: I didn't know we could send a custom image caption. I named all the files as "PIXEL ART, <character name<, Standing. The logs showed that replicated used it's own captions. Maybe let me see how to make it use mine.
[2024-01-17, 20:47:22] Ambika Computational Mama: will do captions with BLIP
[2024-01-17, 20:47:28] Ambika Computational Mama: Might be useful
[2024-01-17, 20:58:56] ~ Krishnan: Thanks, let me check
[2024-01-17, 21:01:33] Ambika Computational Mama: oh interesting can you elaborate more please
[2024-01-17, 21:20:15] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: Sure
So depending on the kind of concept you are trying to achieve you'll need a different amount/variety of data. The amount of data needed for SDXL lora is considerably lower as SDXL already knows a lot of stylistic concepts quite well. So if you are going for a generalised style, you can get away with using 40ish images of varied concepts (a few portraits, a few landscapes, a few buildings, a few animals, a few objects). Train it as a lora/locon (unet only) for around 25 epochs with a self tuning optimiser like prodigy/dadapt adam. 
For captioning, i recommend captioning using a good caption model such as qwen/llava without mentioning the style in the caption (unless you want to use a trigger word for this lora, then add the trigger word to the caption).

[2024-01-25, 23:48:14] ~ YP: I like how well they understand diffusion models. " This layer, where the prompt and the image meet, seems to have a huge impact on the image quality." - this is where we have the best of transfer learning. In general leveraging pretrained weights, with true use of lora
[2024-01-25, 23:49:19] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: "To simplify things, let's imagine these models as a big, complex Lego castle. Now, suppose you want to change something about this castle - say you want to add a new tower. Normally, you would have to carefully take apart and rebuild large parts of the castle, which could take a long time and be quite difficult.

Now, imagine if you could just remove a few Lego bricks and stick a few new Lego bricks here and there to make your changes. You wouldn't have to touch the rest of the castle at all. This would be much easier and quicker, right?

This is what LoRA (Low-Rank Adaptation) does for big models. Instead of having to learn (or "rebuild") everything, it only learns a few key parts (or "adds a few Lego bricks") to adapt the model to a new task. This makes the whole process a lot quicker and more efficient, just like adding a few bricks to your Lego castle is easier than rebuilding the whole thing."

These 3 paragraphs are truly the simplest way a lora can be explained. It feels like ChatGpt - "explain to a 10 year old".(In a good way)
[2024-01-25, 23:51:34] ~ YP: Exactly. It deffo has made it way more obvious

[2024-01-26, 14:45:56] ~ Y: >> Now, imagine if you could just remove a few Lego bricks and stick a few new Lego bricks here and there to make your changes.

Not sure how correct that example is. You don't really add or remove bricks with LORA :) it's about finetuning rather than adding or removing data. I have seen similar examples which I think is misleading. Let me give it a shot, feel free to correct.

Let's say we have a Bengaluru restaurant guide pre-trained on various local restaurants. Assume it has an N-rank matrix, where each row represents a restaurant and M columns represent attributes such as veg, non-veg, vegan, south Indian, north Indian, Chinese, Italian, bar, brewery, price, location, ratings, etc.

Now, I'm searching for a place near Indiranagar that serves seafood with a 60% discount and no service charge – fair, isn't it? :)

Depending on the original weights, the suggestions may not completely meet my needs. 

This is where techniques like LORA help. We create another weight matrix by fine-tuning only on a small subset of frequently asked parameters like location, discount, etc. These parameters can be encoded into a low-rank matrix with dimensions much smaller than N, making it computationally easier to retrain compared to retraining the original matrix.

Now, when combining this matrix with the original pre-trained weights, the system may recommend 'better' results when specifically used on those small sets of frequently asked parameters (check Figure 1 in the original paper) – 'better' is not always true though.

The beauty is that every time there are new parameters or criteria, we only need to retrain this small delta matrix. Importantly, we can have as many delta matrices as needed, each tuned to separate parameters, like a pluggable module. The advantage is that we can change the adaptation matrix for every inference.

Now, as you can see, you are not really adding or removing restaurants (or building a tower) by just using plain LORA. All you are doing is fine-tuning to get better recommendations based on the existing set of restaurant data.

Nothing comes free though. There is additional computational overhead at inference time and more, but that's a separate topic.

Couldn't resist posting! There is a video by Edward Hu explaining LORA which you can watch. You can easily find it on youtube, or I can post the link later.

[2024-02-01, 02:21:39] ~ Krishnan: The lora instructions said the size of the fine-tuning images doesn't matter, but I simply tried 256*256 images, but even those finetuned with that seems to give better output for 1024*1024.

[2024-02-10, 20:04:56] ~ Manaswi: Unfortunately there isn't. Meta's musicGen is a text to music foundation model that is open source tho and has hugging face checkpoints that you can use for inference too. Stable audio is another that just released their code (but no checkpoints yet) this week
[2024-02-12, 11:32:49] ~ Skk: Hi All,

I am founder of a beauty category focussed startup called Trabuli.

I am looking to hire an intern for an 8 week stint.

Requirements are simple :
1) Fine tuning stable diffusion for a beauty category use case. 
2) Should have working knowledge of setting up Google Collab notebook and working on it
3) creating renders through Computer vision would be nice to have but not mandatory 

It is a paid gig.

Please refer if you know of someone suitable.

[2024-02-12, 22:06:22] ~ Nathan: This question has probably been asked a million times here but I’m gonna ask it anyways…

What’s the best way to create a professional looking product image without distorting the product?

Would it be using some masking + SDXL for the anti-masked part which might produce a sort of weird outline at the product edges due to masking inefficiencies 

Or would it be something like SD + control net with some specific settings? Or maybe something else?

Any ideas/suggestions would be really appreciated!
[2024-02-12, 22:44:26] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Honest answer is it depends on product. 🫢
[2024-02-12, 22:48:50] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: If your product has minute details that you want maintained, i would still recommend going for the non-ai/hybrid solution (3d)

[2024-02-12, 23:18:07] Rahul Deora: Doesn’t work
[2024-02-12, 23:18:54] Rahul Deora: All the solutions you listed would fail due to outgrowth, placement issues, realism(shadows etc) or quality differences
[2024-02-12, 23:19:17] Rahul Deora: We’ve trained our own model for this very usecase so we know
[2024-02-12, 23:25:03] ~ Nathan: Ohh that’s sooo cool, mind if I message you privately?

[2024-02-13, 19:11:28] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Appreciate the effort spent in putting a framework around a very nebulous area! 👍🏻


Would have loved to see more in detail on ROI in GenAI
Some topics like Efforts vs investment spent in finetuning vs using open source

How your own O-A curve would look like using off the shelf APIs vs fine tuning an off the self model ,any platform risks etc.

Also LLMs are not usually the correct tool for every business ,so some pointers on what are the areas of application of LLMs which maximise O-A curve slope would be great 

That would help build comprehensive picture and guide discussion with CXOs. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-13, 19:37:30] Anuj Gupta DLBLR Meetups: TBH if you read it fully I have addressed it to an extent. what you refer as “Efforts vs investment spent in finetuning vs using open source” I dont see it that way. According to me its open source/third party followed by finetuning
[2024-02-13, 19:46:03] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: My bad
I meant using off the shelf models,finetuning off the shelf models or finetuning open source

I have read it fully though and called out points  where certain details will help rather than  generic statements.

It is because I’m grappling with the same problems today in convincing C suite execs where to use it and how to measure ROI on products where it is will used.
And surprisingly it’s also an issue where I’m trying to convince execs where NOT to use LLMs.
 
Anyway looking forward to more such write ups.
[2024-02-13, 19:47:32] Anuj Gupta DLBLR Meetups: TBH “finetuning off the shelf models or finetuning open source“ depends big time on problem and dataset. cant give a general statement
[2024-02-13, 19:47:53] Anuj Gupta DLBLR Meetups: there is no fixed answer
[2024-02-13, 19:50:28] Anuj Gupta DLBLR Meetups: @919619432911 “It is because I’m grappling with the same problems today in convincing C suite execs where to use it and how to measure ROI on products where it is will used.“ - you cant quantify ROI upfront
[2024-02-13, 19:50:56] Anuj Gupta DLBLR Meetups: the article addresses how in general ROI curve unfolds in AI including GenAI
[2024-02-13, 19:52:06] Anuj Gupta DLBLR Meetups: I think what you are looking for is “for my problem, how much will be the ROI”
[2024-02-13, 20:07:08] ~ Prasad: - Maybe mention risk factor as well. Ignoring AI is risk of losing edge to compititors who do. So people shouldnt just look at ROI but risk of loss of not investing in AI.
- In certain areas (especially AI as a tool applications) its better to wait and start late. Its like genome decoding, late starters benefit from more reliable tech and is cheaper as well.
[2024-02-13, 21:18:48] ~ Shivansh: Hey Guys, How to interpret schedulers and samplers for diffusion process? Is there some guide to what works better with what? If someone has tried different schedulers, which one’s good for generating realistic human?

It also let's you have a master prepend and append for all of the main prompts which can be pretty useful when testing out different styles/lora
[2024-02-18, 15:59:33] Ambika Computational Mama: Im able to use load image base 64 with TD, then connect webcam - need to connect text prompts

looks like each versions of their models would be 18 months apart from each other
Each team gets 18 months of time to prepare for their next release
but there are 6-7 of such teams that can cycle throughout entire year and keep everyone on their toes all the time 🤔
[2024-02-18, 19:15:16] Rahul Deora: Who said each team gets 18 months?
[2024-02-18, 19:15:30] Rahul Deora: This is just a random law he made up he is staying

Time between dalle2 and dalle3 was 18 months.
[2024-02-20, 19:34:13] ~ Sid: I'm planning to build an app on windows to search the photos using text (description).
I'm thinking of annotating the images using llava-33b and store it in some DB along with metadata (Like date) and tags (Like receipt, screenshot etc).
then RAG to search the images.

what kind of db would be good for this use case??
image size is approx 50k images.
platform is windows.

[2024-02-23, 09:29:40] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Good paper. Can you compare against results from foocus. It has a custom implementation for in painting and style options that have product photo.

Not saying good or bad. But, see if comparison shares something.
[2024-02-23, 09:35:09] Rahul Deora: Thanks we will check it out, don’t think it will prevent outgrowths tho
[2024-02-23, 09:36:51] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: There is nothing like fine tuning you have done. It's more of their inpainting function and styles that are a good baseline

[2024-03-13, 20:20:48] Ayush Yadav: Dies anyone working with LLMs know how can we summarise 1000s of reviews, like Amazon started doing it?

In Amazon you can see summary of review of a product now
[2024-03-13, 21:11:32] Nirant K: It's an old trick: Do aspect based sentiment analysis and then tally the frequency up
[2024-03-13, 21:11:50] Nirant K: Which aspects? Usually tied to the category, or you can even ask the LLM!
[2024-03-13, 21:12:07] ~ Ajay: What does this mean?
[2024-03-13, 21:12:18] Nirant K: And by old, I mean it's from 1980s if I remember correctly, but I might be wrong
[2024-03-13, 21:12:32] ~ Ajay: Can you maybe give one example of an aspect here?
[2024-03-13, 21:13:47] Nirant K: Aspects are basically dimensions along which you want to measure sentiment.

So say, in a review like "Farhan Akhtar proves his mettle as an actor and producer, but the music is what takes the show"

You can have aspects like acting, music for the movie — both of which would be positive in this review
[2024-03-13, 21:16:56] ~ Ajay: Maybe I'm a bit confused about what feature Amazon exposed. Is it just a "summary" which is a textual para about all the reviews together? Or is it a bunch of meta tags with frequencies?
[2024-03-13, 21:18:37] Nirant K: You can get tags and then synthesize it back into text. Can add extracted text back into the summary. 
[2024-03-13, 21:19:06] Nirant K: It's not a "grand total" summary for sure — that's just too computationally expensive and Amazon Retail is known to be frugal

[2024-03-15, 14:57:10] Sourasis Roy: very nice !
[2024-03-15, 15:09:45] Rahul Deora: Won’t you have to create too many templates like this?
[2024-03-15, 15:14:34] Kishore GenAI: Yes but also not entirely. There are multiple AI models which can help in layout planning, asset orientation, and we have custom scripts for HDRIs and lighting and procedural assets, using which I can generate templates which are 80% ready, then work on it to get till 100%. We are consistently trying to figure out how to increase that so that the very first step for template creation is good. Also this is being rendered, hence it will be consistent throughout the video.
[2024-03-15, 15:16:29] Kishore GenAI: We are consistenly testing different ways to create the template example, from image to depth to point locations to being able to extract independent assets and create bounding boxes and mesh to place the assets in scenes. But it is all early for us to figure out entirely. Interesting space from a technical standpoint.
[2024-03-15, 15:18:44] Kishore GenAI: Another point is that this ensures that all physical simulations are accurate. which means we can add one click effects such as Condensation, rain etc in the coming versions, which again will remain consistent across the time duration of the video.
[2024-03-15, 15:39:23] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: If you think your new product can be integrated into quickads someway with synergies then let’s explore that. I am focusing on other aspects of videos. So, product videos could come from you for example.

this is pretty big too
[2024-03-21, 14:44:51] Sudharshan GenAI: "We introduce Evolutionary Model Merge, a general method that uses evolutionary techniques to efficiently discover the best ways to combine different models from the vast ocean of different open-source models with diverse capabilities. As of writing, Hugging Face has over 500k models in dozens of different modalities that, in principle, could be combined to form new models with new capabilities! By working with the vast collective intelligence of existing open models, our method is able to automatically create new foundation models with desired capabilities specified by the user."
[2024-03-21, 14:44:56] Sudharshan GenAI: sakana AI

[2024-03-21, 15:00:42] Sudharshan GenAI: Paper say so - they have a Japanese VLM and some math model
[2024-03-21, 15:00:49] Sudharshan GenAI: I just skimmed
[2024-03-21, 15:10:15] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Oddly familar pathway on Linux evolution as well.

Altruistic pure open source doesn't work. Sad for the open source community. I was also hoping and hooting to use their stable video. Now at least video generation (which needs even more data and compute) is in the hands of large big tech. Don't know how much they will give even an API for it.

[2024-03-23, 11:56:07] Nirant K: Basically, there is a case to be optimistic
[2024-03-23, 12:01:38] Abhishek Maiti: From where is it being inferred that msft is taking over? Didnt see anything related to msft on the announcement post.
[2024-03-23, 12:02:22] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: @917737887058 somehow I am reminded of our discussion - open source with no clear profit pool is too alturistic. Sad day for the community but I guess hosted, fine tuned enterprise grade SD is the likely direction.
Clipdrop was also sold to Jasper recently.
[2024-03-23, 12:02:24] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: (if my memory is right on our discussion)
[2024-03-23, 12:07:48] Nirant K: Founder/CEO stepping away
[2024-03-23, 12:08:07] Nirant K: Github was on sale for much longer, MSFT just got it at the right price, right time
[2024-03-23, 12:08:38] Nirant K: Also, in AI — since talent matters a lot more than distribution right now — startups don't matter much e.g. see Inflection
[2024-03-23, 12:08:47] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Most of SD mgmt / key engineers resigned few days back
[2024-03-23, 14:17:08] Rahul Deora: Enterprise will only fine tune, you need someone to do architectural and scale innovations

[2024-03-23, 14:18:23] Rahul Deora: Fine tuning is a local optimum, someone needs to be upgrading the base models
[2024-03-23, 14:19:02] Rahul Deora: They should have instead do a mix of open-source and proprietary solutions
[2024-03-23, 14:20:32] Rahul Deora: Inflection couldn’t compete with their models like Anthropic can
[2024-03-23, 14:21:49] Rahul Deora: In imagining Stability was on the peak, they didn’t have clear monitization initiative
[2024-03-23, 14:23:59] Priyesh OnFinance: this seems to be classic VC pressure in the direction that Midjourney is closed source and simply has access to all stable diffusion models but not the other way round
[2024-03-23, 14:24:14] Priyesh OnFinance: same with OpenAI teams
[2024-03-23, 14:24:41] Priyesh OnFinance: I think we need legislation that closed source foundational models are banned or a different tax tier for FM companies.
[2024-03-23, 15:14:44] Rahul Deora: You can’t ban closed source foundation models 😅, that would remove too much incentive
[2024-03-23, 15:15:27] Rahul Deora: This is probably what’s missing
[2024-03-25, 07:15:19] Nirant K: For folks working on LoRA, this allows you to batch them — would love to hear how folks are solving for that right now

[2024-04-24, 16:58:47] ~ Kiran Nambiar: Hi All, we’ve been working on building a GenAI based conversational platform to help new to novice investors make better financial decisions. The idea is that you can ask an MyFi (the app) questions you wouldn’t ask another human and we also give you an unbiased assessment. It’s still super early days and we’re only in beta testing (please don’t make any financial decisions solely based on this…. Yet). 

https://qlwa5.app.link/beta-testing

Feedback can be given directly within the app. Only way to make the product better is with your help!

[2024-04-25, 16:01:42] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: just curious which rule was broken here. Olivia shared a link to working product (it's a rule) along with more info (i.e. context) in the form of a linkedin post.

[2024-04-25, 16:06:40] Divya Tak: > Inviting and conversation initiating 

the CTA for the shared message was to redirect readers to a linkedin post, not to start a conversation here on the group
[2024-04-25, 16:13:58] Nirant K: Our intent is to encourage conversation here. Posting your own LinkedIn posts as a CTA kinda defeats that point. 

There's also the risk that this becomes a self promotion channel -- it's fair to assume that we've a ton of amazing folks building things who'll need distribution.

You'll notice that direct working demo links are encouraged. Even YouTube videos of demo are awesome
[2024-04-25, 16:14:13] Divya Tak: also if you check there is a rule around not reposting. This message was a repost from women in AI community

[2024-04-25, 16:25:33] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: even from a reader's perspective, that group has 205 members vs this group has 611, and not all of those 205 members would be part of this group. so, posting on that group doesn't mean it's being read by all members here or vice-versa. People joined both the groups at their discretion and they would be aware of duplicates. there's no need to add such rule.
[2024-04-25, 16:29:54] Divya Tak: That is post reach perspective. We err on the side of not irritating folks with double posting, especially considering several folks are in 4-5 groups in the community. I can understand how this can feel frustrating at times though.
[2024-04-26, 11:48:10] ~ विक्रम: Hello Everyone, Has anyone used Inpainting in production? 

If yes, How do you make sure that the quality of inpainted image is enhanced?

 I have tried various image enhancement model such as Demo fusion but they alter the real objects(unmasked area) , which shouldn't happen.
[2024-04-26, 13:41:12] Divya Tak: @917407651462 and the dashtoon team have inpainting in the dashtoon studio. Works quite well too.
[2024-04-26, 13:48:49] Kishore GenAI: Define enhanced. 
Possible options:
 1.Inpainting strength might be non zero
2. Your mask is not applied correctly
[2024-04-26, 13:52:22] ~ विक्रम: Through enhanced , I meant higher quality. As inpainting often lowers the quality of original uploaded image.

 For masking , I was using rembg before but now switched to tracer-b7-neural networks .

[2024-04-26, 13:53:12] ~ विक्रम: Thank you , will check this out
[2024-04-26, 13:54:42] Kishore GenAI: It should lower the image quality.  The entire process works like a compression algorithm.

You can try this just take an image and send it through the encoder and decoder, you will fail to get the original product image back.
[2024-04-26, 13:55:38] Kishore GenAI: In stable diffusion course of fast ai Johnathan Whitaker explains this. Strong recommendation to check it out.
[2024-04-26, 13:57:13] ~ विक्रम: Yup , I'm following that course as well. I know it do lowers the quality but models like Demofusion did exceptionally raises the quality  . This is the reason , I was looking for similar models but each of them altered the original product 😅.

Thanks again

[2024-04-26, 13:57:56] Kishore GenAI: This is the exact clip in which talks about the compression.
[2024-04-26, 13:59:30] Kishore GenAI: The simplest and the best solution now is copy pasta. But if I remember correctly folks from unstudio @919896021155 trained a model which can then ensure the lighting shadows are not jumbled up due to this process. You can try their software too.
[2024-04-26, 14:01:51] ~ विक्रम: Btw what did you use to combine all images and made this result?

 Looks like inpainting + img2img to me. Am I correct?
[2024-04-26, 14:02:26] ~ विक्रम: Thanks will check this out
[2024-04-26, 14:03:41] Kishore GenAI: I didn’t use huggingface diffusers to do this. This is all internal code but yeah in a way inpainting + multi controlnet + clip interrogator.
[2024-04-26, 14:05:05] Kishore GenAI: A1111 repo with api calls is a viable alternative but they have issues on memory leaks. You can ping @918764022384 as well for any hosting solutions or for api calls. His is also pretty good at this
[2024-04-26, 14:06:24] ~ विक्रम: Got it , Thanks again
[2024-04-26, 14:13:40] ~ Aseem: This happens because even the masked area is encoded and then decoded at the end of the process. Encoding is a lossy process and you end of loosing details. Open ai released a new decoder last year which improves this but still not perfect
[2024-04-26, 14:14:06] ~ Aseem: The solution is to paste the original masked area back and then do blending for some Color correction
[2024-04-26, 14:15:22] ~ विक्रम: I have done this , pasting the original masked area back . This was the first thought which came into my mind.
[2024-04-26, 14:16:27] ~ विक्रम: Thanks will check this as well

[2024-04-29, 10:32:09] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: Are you looking to generate all kinds of images, or is there specific usecase you are looking to solve for? 

Like, I'd like to solve a usecase where generation of e-commerce ad creatives becomes easier. I wouldn't care much about the unrealistic/futuristic kinda images which most models are good at. But very specific ones like banners, products, their backgrounds, etc. 

Do you have any special usecase like this? Or are you looking to train models to generate any and all kind of images?
[2024-04-29, 10:33:55] Nirant K: Side note: If you're building a text to image model from (relatively) scratch, you'd need all sorts of images for pretraining and only later you'd optimize for task or domain specific information. This pretraining is as important, if not more than task/domain specific for future generalisaiton to unseen scenarios

Same for vision is a blob of pixels without defined boundaries iywim, have seen research calling it objects, segments, stuff , scene … all of this combined with a lot of inter-relations to form that visual world “language”, a bit more abstract
[2024-04-29, 12:20:13] Digvijay GenAI Group: Maybe because of reasons like these we see more progress in LLMs > VLMs (architectures with potential to harness raw data)

is there any open-source equivalent of Midjourney Blend feature?

IMO InstantID,Style is the equivalent of midjourney sref (style ref) but im not aware of anything similar to their Blend feature. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-29, 17:56:54] Sudharshan GenAI: What does blend do?
[2024-04-29, 17:58:14] Shashank Generative AI Group: from their site:
"The /blend command allows you to upload 2–5 images quickly and then looks at the concepts and aesthetics of each image and merges them into a novel new image."

https://docs.midjourney.com/docs/blend
[2024-04-29, 18:00:38] Shashank Generative AI Group: it's different than image prompts. promptless method.

i also think it's the most underhyped MJ feature. i have a lot of images in pinterest and it's so much fun just dropping 2-5 of them in MJ and get amazing results.

very low entry barrier. no prompt skills needed. that's why "underhyped". it's the perfect magical ux to start learning MJ.
[2024-04-29, 18:00:58] Sudharshan GenAI: "/blend is the same as using multiple image prompts with /imagine, but the interface is optimized for easy use on mobile devices."
[2024-04-29, 18:01:11] Sudharshan GenAI: Interesting - let me check

[2024-04-29, 18:15:28] Shashank Generative AI Group: yeah. this is great for inventing/discovering a new aesthetic. 

it's not even a new feature! 
while sref,cref are about adopting just style, character; this  one takes all aesthetics of multiple images and smashes them into a new one. 

then one could take the Blend output and use it with sref to replicate that new style.
[2024-04-29, 18:23:49] Shashank Generative AI Group: yeah i described it incorrectly. is a subset of image prompts. just discovered: on the MJ alpha site, hovering over the source images shows "image prompt".

it's basically a "textless multi-image prompt" hence requires minimum 2 images.

[2024-04-30, 19:57:09] ~ Adhitya Swaminathan: Great point. Something I’ve been thinking about recently, maybe our way of representing visual information isn’t the most efficient. Pixels don’t capture information the same way for visual concepts that words do for text. From a human perspective, a sentence is a collection of words, but an image isn’t a collection of pixels, but rather objects that we implicitly understand. 

A friend of mine working in computer graphics also felt the same way. Pixels are not just restrictive from an intuition standpoint, but also from an efficiency one.

We could be wrong here, and even if what I say makes sense, I’m not sure what an alternative would look like.

[2024-04-30, 21:06:16] Digvijay GenAI Group: You actually put it better than me ♥️

Time to go back to sift ,  superpixel & mrf/crf days 😂😂

Jk aside , I think VLMs might be on the right path .. where basically a word May have similar embeddings as it’s visual representation ( probably words weighted over visual rep)

And this is maybe cuz we need to represent “semantics” & for that words ( or the parent word ) is naturally better than the eigen of say smth like a tree ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-04-30, 22:03:32] Digvijay GenAI Group: Or maybe it helps you become hot ?
[2024-04-30, 22:03:41] Digvijay GenAI Group: Prolly will ask to spout a lot lol
[2024-04-30, 22:04:43] Digvijay GenAI Group: Maybe but i feel a dedicated high density landmark model will work much better considering people will take photos as portraits ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-30, 22:07:17] Ayush Yadav: That's why I was just like ... You take a totally unreliable thing to rate something.. that felt stupid.
[2024-04-30, 22:07:35] Ayush Yadav: Ya that's why I asked here
[2024-04-30, 22:07:39] Sudharshan GenAI: how would you classify/map the landmarks to the rating?
[2024-04-30, 22:09:38] Digvijay GenAI Group: Umm first guess - convert landmarks into normalised embeddings , append before the final few fcn layers with a multi headed output for each of those ratings
[2024-04-30, 22:13:49] Digvijay GenAI Group: This one looks pretty cool https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.02776

[2024-05-08, 11:07:53] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: have created images on DALLE and stable diffusion
[2024-05-08, 11:07:55] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: but not stickers
[2024-05-08, 11:07:59] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: What special would you need for stickers, like today you can get sticker made of anything
[2024-05-08, 11:08:22] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: Is there a particular type of sticker you had in mind ?
[2024-05-08, 11:10:34] Divya Tak: You can try using a stable diffusion tool that lets you train characters/style for consistency
[2024-05-08, 11:11:03] Divya Tak: And then you can use a background removal step
[2024-05-08, 11:11:17] Divya Tak: In either SD or in Photoshop/firefly
[2024-05-08, 11:11:51] Divya Tak: If it's one off, you can use one of the tools that creates vectors
[2024-05-08, 11:13:27] Sailesh Sydelabs: I just had ideas in mind, prompts mostly. Was probably looking for a lazy way out
[2024-05-08, 11:13:36] Sailesh Sydelabs: Thanks this helps, will try it out

[2024-05-08, 11:22:27] Sailesh Sydelabs: Understood… thank you
[2024-05-08, 11:23:44] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: Also sorry because I was helping my toddler with school homework, did you mean physical sticky-stickers  or the Mobile ones which you send on Whatsapp.
[2024-05-08, 11:23:57] Sailesh Sydelabs: Physical
[2024-05-08, 11:26:02] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: Great, so now a days you can get sticker paper in stationary stores, where you can print just about anything and then cut it. 

We’ve used Full print stickers in standard rectangle cuts around to make logo / name stickers to hand out in conferences. 
 
These you can easily do in Midjourney / Ideogram (Ideogram is great with Text and Kawaii Art - both Vector and scaler)

[2024-05-08, 11:26:42] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: For stuff like this put “Isolated on white background” to get the white bg effect, then you can cut with scissors.
[2024-05-08, 11:27:02] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: Alternately, you can grow outline and mark in photoshop, if you have access to a Cricut machine
[2024-05-08, 11:27:27] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: It’ll cut it and make real fancy ones like you get in massproduced.
[2024-05-08, 11:27:27] Divya Tak: Or kolorkode on Richmond road does it too
[2024-05-08, 11:27:44] Divya Tak: This is also rather cheap to get done
[2024-05-08, 11:27:53] Divya Tak: Do you have a cricut?
[2024-05-08, 11:28:52] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: No, but a friend had it in Singaproe and I got to play around in my last visit.
[2024-05-08, 11:29:22] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: Its awesome toy but lower in food chain than a 3D printer in my wishlist
[2024-05-08, 11:29:43] Divya Tak: I wanna buy one, but I'd have to be serious with my stationary selling to justify owning it
[2024-05-08, 11:29:57] Divya Tak: Lol toy vs tool 🤣🤣

[2024-05-08, 11:31:25] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: And I think Cricut ones  would be easier to store in Indian housing.
[2024-05-08, 11:31:55] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: But these guys would probably stand over 3D printed ones, not the Cricut ones
[2024-05-08, 11:37:40] Sailesh Sydelabs: lovely, i can be lazy and still get good quality work done.  Ideogram does work well on short texts.
[2024-05-08, 11:53:42] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: You also get these, using which you can DIY fridge magnets.

We're slowly releasing Julep, an open source platform for building stateful AI apps.

We wanna solve for the many headaches that come with working with LLMs:
- managing conversation history + compression,
- document retrieval
- prototyping with different LLMs,
- tool calling & integration with different apps.

I'd love to talk to more ppl who are building their own solutions to this using alternatives!
 
Would also appreciate some feedback on our repo + docs:

[2024-05-10, 19:05:47] Ayush Yadav: Hello builders,

Ayush this side.

Today I am finally launching my product SuperHeroAI.pro that I have been working on, on-off for months.

Generate SuperHero avatar of yourself using just one image.

It took way more motivation to finish it & way way more to reach this point that I am confident to share it.

Do check it out, you can generate a free image, you'll receive it within 5 minutes of generation via email & it would appear it in gallery.

When you buy a pack, Pack generations you'll receive with in next 24 hours. 

https://twitter.com/ayushunleashed/status/1788900461858177090?t=PgxN40UXtgiWFIgAHArE4A&s=19
[2024-05-10, 19:08:55] Ayush Yadav: The 24 hour time for pack is because I haven't automated that part yet + an extra later of human quality check. 😅
[2024-05-10, 19:16:18] Ayush Yadav: & please let me know if you have any feedback.

It's my first SAAS & first time trying to get customers too. 

Would appreciate your insights from your journey.
[2024-05-10, 22:47:59] Ayush Yadav: Took me a while but here it is. 😅 

You can try now at SuperHeroAI.pro
[2024-05-11, 14:52:15] Ayush Yadav: Just an update if someone would be interested in it. 

The tweet reached 40K+ impressions

122 people generated their avatars 

180 total sign-ups ( this has people who signed before the launch too ) 

2K + visitors on website , reached vercel free limit so no more stats after that. 

Sales ??? - 0 till now  😅
‎[2024-05-11, 14:54:47] ~ Deven: ‎image omitted
[2024-05-11, 15:17:06] Divya Tak: 💯 this kind of updates are valuable
[2024-05-11, 15:17:16] Divya Tak: Every one talks about launch
[2024-05-11, 15:17:29] Divya Tak: But launch is like first date, relationship is long
[2024-05-11, 15:20:56] Ayush Yadav: Ya & I think this group has seen updates from when this project was just in Google Colab notebook. 😅
[2024-05-11, 15:21:55] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Hey all the best for this man, definitely looks exciting. 

The face morphed into the images are too big and the texture seems off too compared to the rest of the image. 

Also is there a particular reason why you restricted to superheroes? If you did something like help people auto-create profession work photos I think that could be gold. 

What else does the community think? How do you make this a compelling product people will pay for?
[2024-05-11, 15:36:45] Ayush Yadav: People much faster than me already shipped general AI avatar generators.

That's why I needed a niche.

"Make something you want to exist in the world" 

I like SuperHeros that's why this. 

Back of the mind I also had thinking that no vc funded startup will go this niche so may be it could work.

But ya that doesn't mean it could get sells.
[2024-05-11, 15:37:15] Ayush Yadav: Texture seems off you mean face with rest of body ?
[2024-05-11, 15:38:02] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Yeah. I didn't try it though, this was an observation based on the morphed images you put on the site for display
[2024-05-11, 15:39:26] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Noted, there could still be a way to make sales through the superhero route 🤘🏼
[2024-05-11, 15:41:47] Ayush Yadav: Anyone who's not in India can please open SuperHeroAI.pro & see the pricing page.

Is it showing prices in dollars or rupees?

I added a check but I couldn't get it confirmed. 😅
[2024-05-11, 15:44:08] ~ Vivek Khandelwal: Inr
[2024-05-11, 15:48:24] Ayush Yadav: I messed up .
[2024-05-11, 15:51:00] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: I liked the implementation, but not enough to pay. 

What I’d love Instead of pre-known characters, can it give me a new Superhero Costume based on certain inputs 
- Favorite color / animal etc 
- ⁠Put a Motif on my costume (T for Thakkar instead of S for superman)
- ⁠Write a small back story 

Basically these are the things in a standard RPG character builder, strengths, Moral values, Alignment etc which help build up a story. 

Then to extend. 
- Can I give another photo and make a Super Villian (eveyone needs someone to fight, your Boss, Your Controlling Invester, Your Nemesis , etc etc)
[2024-05-11, 15:51:29] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: Can it then write a story of our clash, and then Can it integrate with something like DashToons to eventually come to a Comicbook.
[2024-05-11, 15:52:00] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: Just some thoughts.
[2024-05-11, 15:53:14] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: I’d also like different art styles, and atleast one of them vector, so I can export to Tshirts/ Jigsaw puzzles/ create a banner for a Kid’s B’day etc.
[2024-05-11, 15:54:02] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: If you love Superheros, and Comics, I’ll end inputs by shameless plug to my favorite book 

https://www.amazon.in/Understanding-Comics-Scott-McCloud/dp/006097625X/ 

Followed by other “Making Comics” in same series.
‎[2024-05-11, 15:57:35] Ayush Yadav: ‎image omitted
[2024-05-11, 16:09:28] Divya Tak: 💯 must read for any comics enjoyer
[2024-05-11, 17:11:17] Ayush Yadav: I asked someone from Australia, they can see in Dollars
[2024-05-11, 17:12:35] Ayush Yadav: Okay I didn't thought that way. That's interesting
[2024-05-11, 17:17:04] Ayush Yadav: Intersting idea but, I don't know who would do this though. 

This feels basically custom comic creation. So we are going more niche maybe ( Which first of all requires more effort from user then just uploading a photo) 

Something probably team at Dashtoon could consider for getting user engagement.

Personalised stories. 

Maybe a feature in Dashtoon mobile app. 

@917407651462
[2024-05-11, 17:30:36] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: Yes, so Identify your Target Audience and think what they want to do. In its current form, it’s probably better for ComicCon / wannabe Cosplayers, but would they pay? or browse YouTube to DIY it themselves. They’re probably hit by a lot of Marketing anyway from other apps which do this.
[2024-05-11, 17:33:57] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: Who would pay is a good question, I dont think anyone in this group will (can probably prompt it themselves) , so your market is for AI n00bs, who want something done. 

Are they people who want a PFP on FB/Twitter? Is the novelty worth it? Is CAC less than what one might pay ?
[2024-05-12, 08:12:18] Nirant K: For future reference, there is a Chrome extension called "Browsec" — it's a very insecure VPC, but good for quick checks like this. Has Singapore, UK in the free tier.
[2024-05-12, 13:25:29] ~ Prajwal: This is so true, my genai application has 1200+ users so far, 80 DAU and 0 paying users so far
[2024-05-12, 13:32:32] Divya Tak: Are those numbers unusual for non gen ai freemium products?
[2024-05-12, 14:13:55] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Yeah, building business out of GenAI product is not simple because it is getting commoditised very fast.
[2024-05-12, 14:45:56] Ayush Yadav: what's your product
[2024-05-12, 20:23:42] ~ Prajwal: It's a Image to Code AI app, allows people to convert UI images to HTML CSS
[2024-05-12, 20:25:30] Ayush Yadav: Can you link it or is it in stealth

Hey guys, we made significant changes in our AI-wrapper tool. We originally released it on Producthunt here a quarter ago. Got #2 product of the day. It was well received with US audience (as oppose to Indian audience where not a single trx was made) 

Wud request everyone to check it out and share with anyone who might be searching for such a L&D tool. 

Can't wait to hear any feedback from this community.

[2024-05-15, 16:45:30] Vamshi: Anyone here have insights into the different approaches taken by Suno, Udio and Eleven Labs music generation, as compared with the older work published by the open ai jukebox team?
[2024-05-15, 16:45:38] Vamshi: This one 

https://arxiv.org/pdf/2005.00341
[2024-05-15, 16:49:09] Vamshi: Also, are there some new approaches unlocked for music tool builders with the new multi modal stuff in GPT4o via their API ?
Or is it only trained on limited prosodic expression for speech data only ?
[2024-05-15, 16:54:18] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: They did show some examples of gpt 4o voice assistant singing.
[2024-05-15, 16:54:43] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: And have some examples in the YouTube channel as well
[2024-05-15, 17:16:43] Vamshi: Yeah I was asking based on that demo. But I think it’s more expressive speech rather than singing. Maybe …
[2024-05-15, 17:17:31] Vamshi: I asked GPT4o to summarise answers to all my questions. I don’t know how much is hallucinated. Will have to cross check. Will be nice if anyone else with insights can comment on the summary.

[2024-05-15, 17:18:29] Vamshi: It doesn’t even talk about Suno music generation so I’m not sure of the quality of this
[2024-05-15, 17:18:59] Vamshi: Maybe it just has some truths scattered here and there
[2024-05-15, 17:19:25] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: https://youtu.be/Bb4HkLzatb4?si=yHKJC9OzOJe048Ey
This was pretty interesting.
[2024-05-15, 17:22:23] Vamshi: Very cool 😎 I didn’t see this one. I did try all morning after their release to try to get it to sing, but it was hard 😅
[2024-05-15, 17:23:03] Vamshi: It did a very half hearted happy birthday
[2024-05-15, 17:23:21] Vamshi: Let me try again
[2024-05-15, 17:23:56] ~ Harsha Subramanyam: Speaking of happy birthday
https://youtu.be/V6pYxfcDRks?si=h3UrDQB5DTauNLKI
This was scarily awkward
[2024-05-15, 17:25:42] Vamshi: Hahahaha ! I think we’ll start failing captchas soon.
[2024-05-15, 18:05:46] Vamshi: It updated it a bit, but still only a little correct and a little useful. Guess garbage in garbage out.

[2024-05-15, 18:56:22] Vamshi: Thanks in advance
[2024-05-15, 19:10:32] Vamshi: Either way it appears very unlikely it understands music, and its capabilities are limited to expressive speech …

Hope this helps
[2024-05-15, 21:13:54] Prashant Dixit GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: I want to do benchmarking of Gpt4-o with other versions of Gpt, if anyone can help or share resources for it
[2024-05-15, 21:14:20] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: same here!
[2024-05-15, 21:15:15] Prashant Dixit GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: Because OpenAI eval is not supporting gpt4-o yet, I have raised issue for the same in their repo
[2024-05-15, 21:15:32] ~ Prashant Srivastav: Already benchmarked https://nian.llmonpy.ai/
[2024-05-15, 21:16:49] Prashant Dixit GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: Yes looking into it, thank you Prashant
[2024-05-15, 21:17:20] Prashant Dixit GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: Actually I am working on benchmarking it with other available GPTs
[2024-05-15, 21:19:43] Prashant Dixit GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: I'll share results after benchmarking 👍
[2024-05-15, 23:14:57] Vamshi: I found this podcast had some useful tidbits in terms of the broad approaches, transformers vs diffusion for music gen.

It’s with Mikey Shulman of Suno AI.

[2024-05-15, 23:25:47] Vamshi: Maybe updates to GPT4o will make it all irrelevant, but worth the watch. A bit sparse on juicy technical content though …

[2024-05-16, 14:13:11] Ayush Yadav: true, levelsio & danny both foucsed on B2B after a point
[2024-05-16, 14:13:59] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: In a world where cost of building a product becomes lower, I guess the key skill is marketing and attracting customers.

[2024-05-16, 14:15:34] Ayush Yadav: actually interesting idea. Thanks @919953076613 
events like comic con are great for this ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-16, 14:16:10] Shimanta Generative AI: Comic con might backfire 😅
[2024-05-16, 14:16:51] Divya Tak: Yea, but also writing conferences/festivals, movie festivals etc. I'd thinking about what is it that attracts people to your product
[2024-05-16, 14:17:13] Divya Tak: Like 2 in hundred might be super excited about what you're building, but you wanna understand what made them super excited
[2024-05-16, 14:17:22] Divya Tak: And then you wanna hone in on that
[2024-05-16, 14:17:42] Divya Tak: It's tempting to try and please the other 98, but those won't ever be paying customers
[2024-05-16, 14:18:09] Divya Tak: Focus on the ones who really see something special in your product
[2024-05-16, 14:20:15] Shimanta Generative AI: So true. I had tried my hands and got a little bit of traction, and it plateaued after a while. Marketing and sales is a different ballgame altogether
And i realised spending time learning those will take me away from what i loved doing.
Better to partner up
[2024-05-16, 14:29:35] ~ Kay Jey: Yes, not a lot of stall had a queue but this one did. 
And wait time was quite long and people still wanted their pics done like this.
[2024-05-16, 14:32:05] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: I recently saw this in Berlin where a couple of kids were running a random stall in the middle of tourist spots. They would take a photo and print it but with some filters - like a photo of you at the Berlin wall but with a sepia tone and yellowed edges/ background that looks like during WWII etc. I think they would offer it to people and not everyone accepted but many did. Costs like 5 EUR - people just take it as a memoir/souvenir I guess.
[2024-05-16, 15:31:47] ~ Rohan Athawade: Hey guys! Would love some help from the diffusion pros in the group.
Is anyone aware of a method to separately generate image priors for a list of features and then combine them and use the result as a prior for the diffusion process? For example, if I have the list ["a dog", "eating from a bowl", "bowl on the floor"], I'm looking for a way to generate each one of those features separately as image priors, combine them and use the resulting image as a prior for the diffusion process.
"Image priors" is just a placeholder. It could be anything, from feature maps to masks.
This is just a thought. My main motivation behind wanting to implement something like this is that no matter what model I use (regardless of from HF or UI-based like Fooocus), some features are always lost/"less present" when trying to generate more than 10 samples for the same prompt. Prompt weighting is also quite shaky, as if you over-weight a certain feature you lose the others.
If anyone is aware of something similar to this, or knows of an entirely different method to achieve the same, I'd love to have a conversation about it!

Even in our web application (GenVR's web app), we host our custom IP adapter based photo makeover which has great results. 

For multi-ID, there is a paper called Instant Family which does photo makeover of multiple people. And can be used to make a pic of all your team mates in LOTR costume. 

The paper link is:-

[2024-05-16, 22:00:53] Hemant Mohapatra: Many thanks Akshay, seems the paper hasn't released the code yet though. I needed a multi ID tool. How were some of these LOTR-style movie reels done btw, those that came out several quarters ago? I guess they didn't have facial overlays.
[2024-05-16, 22:01:34] Hemant Mohapatra: Viggle discord has some interesting ideas but all single IDs.
