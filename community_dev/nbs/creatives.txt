Here is a link to the community rules : https://nirantk.com/community

In short, we discourage self promotion, but love conversations about what you're learning as you're building using AI. We'd love to know what you guys are working on. 

Something I'm working on right now is a whodunit kinda mystery game where you interrogate different people(AIs) to figure out what happened on a space ship. We're still super early in our development, and have only just started testing the prototype

04/07/2023, 13:51 - Hasan: I have been experimenting with a few models for music production. I’m looking into real-time models but most models are pretty slow and doesn’t offer enough control to be used live on stage.
04/07/2023, 13:51 - Hasan: I have had more success with live visuals. Using face reanimation and style transfer with audio reactive effects via touchdesigner.
04/07/2023, 13:55 - Vamshi: Hello!
04/07/2023, 13:55 - Vamshi: Working on similar lines here
04/07/2023, 13:56 - Vamshi: I’m setting up a small space (1000 sqft) to use unreal engine based VFX with a standard DJ setup - including compositing virtual and real cameras and generative visuals.
04/07/2023, 13:57 - Vamshi: The space is intended to double as an indie mixing mastering room
04/07/2023, 13:57 - Divya Tak: Are you doing open studio days where people can come and see the space? 😅😅
04/07/2023, 13:57 - Vamshi: The idea is to converge to a demo scene type gig
04/07/2023, 13:58 - Vamshi: It’s in early stages right now, the walls and ceiling are done and the acoustic design is being redone I speak
04/07/2023, 13:59 - Vamshi: But I’d be thrilled to do open days

04/07/2023, 14:05 - Divya Tak: How are you using the kinect?
04/07/2023, 14:07 - Vamshi: Sweet, Kinect + Touch Designed was a setup  i loved in 2012, along with a Nintendo wiimote + nunchuck, just added to the madness
04/07/2023, 14:07 - Hasan: Right now, just through touchdesigner and controlled through a midi controller. Some python code to automate a few stuff, it downloads royalty free video content and overlays it over the Kinect with some audio reactivity and trippy effects.
04/07/2023, 14:08 - Divya Tak: Oooooh
04/07/2023, 14:08 - Hasan: Ooh I would love to get my hands on a nunchuck.
04/07/2023, 14:08 - Divya Tak: Wait I'm still a little confused. Why do you need kinect though
04/07/2023, 14:09 - Divya Tak: You can use the midi controller and stuff without kinect too
04/07/2023, 14:09 - Divya Tak: And project effects
04/07/2023, 14:09 - Hasan: No lights in the night clubs for normal camera. So night vision and point cloud works.
04/07/2023, 14:09 - Divya Tak: Ohhh
04/07/2023, 14:10 - Divya Tak: What kinda reactivity do you add?

04/07/2023, 14:12 - Hasan: Kick and snare detection connected to a multiple effects which keeps changing. Bloom, rotation, zoom, saturation etc. don’t remember the whole list honestly.
04/07/2023, 14:12 - Divya Tak: Oooh
04/07/2023, 14:12 - Divya Tak: This sounds so fun
04/07/2023, 14:13 - Divya Tak: How much do you generally have to troubleshoot live and how much is just prepping the thing up for performance
04/07/2023, 14:13 - +91 93734 88596 requested to join.
04/07/2023, 14:15 - Hasan: Just adjustments based on the music, brightness etc. sometimes audience comes to interact with the camera so it’s fun to change things up. No troubleshooting as such.

04/07/2023, 16:26 - Divya Tak: what else are you building in it
04/07/2023, 16:29 - Vamshi: Oh yes, this one right ?

https://riyazapp.com
04/07/2023, 16:29 - Vamshi: So you’re fine tuning the learning experience for South Indian vocalists ?
04/07/2023, 16:29 - Vamshi: Carnatic specifically ?
04/07/2023, 16:29 - +91 96771 41491: I’m looking at ways to push the student to try out more challenging things - one example : AI generated musical patterns - can you sing or play those patterns? How about changes in tempo?  Early days like I said, I’m open to ideas
04/07/2023, 16:30 - Divya Tak: what made you choose south Indian classical? and what makes it different from other kinds of music
04/07/2023, 16:30 - Vamshi: It sounds super interesting, I like the AI Jugalbandi angle too, creative !
04/07/2023, 16:31 - +91 99402 37330: Guys have an actually functional AI video editor? Like one where I can feed in a video dump to understand style and then let it work on top of it?
04/07/2023, 16:31 - +91 96771 41491: Not necessarily vocalists. I’m an instrumentalist myself, and when I teach students, I try and see how to make things more interesting / challenging. There is a “traditional” pedagogy, but that can be creatively delivered too
04/07/2023, 16:32 - Vamshi: Gotcha
04/07/2023, 16:33 - +91 96771 41491: Just where I come from - years of training in South Indian classical violin and vocals 🙂
04/07/2023, 16:34 - +91 96771 41491: What makes it different - this is a very broad based question - which genre are you comparing it to?
04/07/2023, 16:36 - Divya Tak: i meant in terms of the AI part of it, like lets say for vocals, what makes south Indian classical different from opera in terms of figuring out the matching

04/07/2023, 16:41 - Vamshi: I think there’s that joke about wheat that comes up every once in a while which I shall not mention 😄✌️
04/07/2023, 16:44 - +91 96771 41491: Got it. South Indian classical music has a sizeable number of scales / ragas and derivatives of those. Western CM / Opera historically have had modal music - but now stick to a handful of scales, albeit in various keys. Learners of South ICM tend to have challenges comprehending the scales and sounds Self-correcting through ear training doesn’t quite work out for everyone. Most students like feedback from a teacher - or an AI teacher in this case

04/07/2023, 16:46 - +91 96771 41491: These sort of challenges I’m sure are there in several genres. I’m familiar and most comfortable with South Indian music and the learning process.
04/07/2023, 16:50 - Divya Tak: thanks for explaning so nicely. That makes a lot of sense :)
04/07/2023, 16:51 - Vamshi: I can imagine also an attractive positioning of training a teaching assistant who follows along a teaching plan of the master.
04/07/2023, 16:53 - Vamshi: 2 years back we were still on approximately the same place as Robert Rowe’s machine musicianship, and suddenly there’s a quantum jump in possibilities

04/07/2023, 18:59 - Vamshi: I’ve heard the traditional answer and of course it’s that the personality and value of each type of signal chain has its own creative use
04/07/2023, 18:59 - Divya Tak: I haven't found the AI cleaners to be very good, especially they mess up stuff like laughs and other sounds
04/07/2023, 19:00 - Vamshi: This is similar to how people still use tape machines etc to colour their sound with certain personality
04/07/2023, 19:00 - Mihir Mumbai: Nostalgia.
04/07/2023, 19:00 - Vamshi: Interesting
04/07/2023, 19:00 - Mihir Mumbai: And the kind of experiences possible in that environment only.
04/07/2023, 19:00 - Divya Tak: only speaking for podcast usecase
04/07/2023, 19:00 - Mihir Mumbai: I've been part of a studio recording for a music album and it's a fun experience
04/07/2023, 19:01 - Vamshi: Nice, where did you record and what were the top things you liked?
04/07/2023, 19:01 - Divya Tak: Honestly happy to know more about audio cleanup tools that dont fuck it up though
04/07/2023, 19:03 - Mihir Mumbai: I was not performing , just assisting.
04/07/2023, 19:03 - Mihir Mumbai: Was a recording studio in Santa Barbara where Katy perry recorded Teenage Dream. My best friend there was getting her music recorded.
04/07/2023, 19:03 - Mihir Mumbai: The things that the sound engineer was controlling...
04/07/2023, 19:04 - Vamshi: Sounds pretty top notch
04/07/2023, 19:04 - Mihir Mumbai: He was having a back and forth with the artist playing around with the controls
04/07/2023, 19:05 - Mihir Mumbai: I suppose the AI assistance would just help templetize the most common settings... hmm.

04/07/2023, 19:06 - Hasan: I just started using RX editor by izotope. Seems to be working well.
04/07/2023, 19:06 - Vamshi: There 80s and 90s for example were a very fertile time where cheap equipment was repurposed to really interesting ends
04/07/2023, 19:07 - Vamshi: 808s 303s samplers, creative use of turntables
04/07/2023, 19:07 - Vamshi: Which version of Rx ?
04/07/2023, 19:08 - Hasan: v10, v7 didn’t have the ml model integration.
04/07/2023, 19:09 - Vamshi: Having a precisely calibrated space with a traditional collection of gear eats up budget pretty fast

04/07/2023, 19:11 - Vamshi: Nice - as a creative user, and as a purely personal decision for yourself, would you ever rent a real recording booth, or your mic and Rx cleanup goes a long way?
04/07/2023, 19:13 - Vamshi: Also Rx Standard and Rx advanced have a big price differential right ?
04/07/2023, 19:14 - Vamshi: I’m finding this path more promising as well
04/07/2023, 19:15 - Vamshi: So some similar creative choices
04/07/2023, 19:15 - Vamshi: Please feel free to give opinionated and highly personal opinions as they are all very useful perspectives
04/07/2023, 19:16 - Vamshi: And I do hope this discussion is somehow relevant to all with any overlap with music
04/07/2023, 19:19 - Vamshi: We’re at a similar juncture now, where AI and mixed reality can come together into a new generation of musical jams
04/07/2023, 19:20 - Hasan: If you are recording for anything professional, you do need a room which is acoustically treated. I’m a bedroom producer so I just have an audio technica mic and you can take it pretty far if processed well.
04/07/2023, 19:22 - Hasan: I don’t know the price of either. I’m “borrowing” the licence. 🙈

04/07/2023, 19:23 - Vamshi: Compared to traditional acoustics and studio gear, investing in experimental controllers, AI workflow setup for audio and video generation, and a combination of traditional performance with a DJ setup makes for a more experimental space.
04/07/2023, 19:25 - Vamshi: Thanks, good to know your approach

05/07/2023, 11:02 - Vamshi: I’ll try to flesh out some more details and turn it into a brief
05/07/2023, 11:02 - Vamshi: I think the feedback from here is invaluable while the space is coming up
05/07/2023, 11:03 - +91 96194 91715: Some are exclusively Stable Diffusion with specific parts like hand with the flower (titled Celestial Bloom) guided using content.
The diamond hands one had the bitcoin logo added using photoshop.
The eye one was back and forth between SD and Midjourney

05/07/2023, 11:06 - +91 96194 91715: The concept was that “diamond hands never sell” is a popular phrase in crypto circles. The subject of this creation had such diamond hands that he kept hodling till his death which is why his diamond hand is a museum exhibit now.

05/07/2023, 12:14 - Divya Tak: This is pretty too! Maybe we can do a monthly new image generation for our cover image :D
05/07/2023, 12:16 - Divya Tak: Why did you go back and forth between the two?
05/07/2023, 12:16 - Divya Tak: in the last case I mean
05/07/2023, 12:16 - Ambika: Suggesting the theme is always contextual to our location (India?) and shows something collaborative - allow
Ourselves to think of prompts more deeply and not just aesthetically?
05/07/2023, 12:16 - Divya Tak: Yes!
05/07/2023, 12:23 - +91 96194 91715: I get finer composition control only in SD. So took an image from a first pass in Midj and took that too SD
05/07/2023, 12:24 - Divya Tak: do you find that Midj gives better results on certain kinds of prompts and SD (beyond the control) gives better on others?
05/07/2023, 12:40 - +91 96194 91715: well prompting structure is very different. with SD one of the new methods is using booru prompts which are just keywords separated by commas. A lot of model fine tunes on Civit use these booru prompt style captioning. Here's an example - 
(masterpiece),(best quality),(ultra-detailed), (full body:1.2), 1girl,chibi,cute, smile, open mouth, flower, outdoors, playing guitar, music, beret, holding guitar, jacket, blush, shirt, short hair, cherry blossoms, green headwear, blurry, brown hair, blush stickers, long sleeves, bangs, headphones, black hair, pink flower, (beautiful detailed face), (beautiful detailed eyes)
05/07/2023, 12:42 - +91 96194 91715: On the other hand prompting for the latest midjourney seems to work great with narrative prompts such as 
"a cute chibi girl smiling and playing the guitar under a tree in a field with flowers. it's a bright sunny day. she is wearing green clothes and has brown hair"
05/07/2023, 12:42 - Divya Tak: I meant less about prompt engineering and more about concepts?
05/07/2023, 12:44 - +91 96194 91715: Ok haven't searched for an answer to this specifically. Both of them suck at creating hammers or specific tools. But not too much of a problem for me because there are literally Loras for tools and objects now that you can use with SD.
05/07/2023, 12:44 - +91 96194 91715: Photoshop generative fill definitely works much better for realistic stuff and does quite badly at illustration stuff. At least until like a couple of weeks ago
05/07/2023, 12:56 - Divya Tak: Ah makes sense

05/07/2023, 13:41 - Nirant: But why should someone? Indian datasets are more expensive, and consumers are willing to pay less. The first duty of a business is to it's shareholders. If it's not the first duty, you're not a business. <This message was edited>
05/07/2023, 13:43 - +91 97079 48595: The root of this lies in the fact, what I think atleast, that consumers are willing to pay less
05/07/2023, 13:45 - Soumyadeep: They are. There is strictly less paying capacity in India than US.
05/07/2023, 13:46 - Soumyadeep: One signal for this is Youtube Premium penetration in India vs US. Youtube India earns most from ads but not the case in Europe/US.
05/07/2023, 13:47 - Nirant: To use a different frame of reference: Google India Ads income is less than Youtube California Ads quite often
05/07/2023, 13:48 - Soumyadeep: Ads also now have optimisation functions. Ads based on installs/activation work far better in India than Ads based on payments.
05/07/2023, 13:48 - Divya Tak: Ha we are not an economy with as much disposable income
05/07/2023, 13:50 - Soumyadeep: Would love to. Any advise on datasets will help 😅
05/07/2023, 13:50 - Nirant: We've a lot of disposable income, most of it gets disposed in weddings and expenses around that (incl. education, which is a sub-head under wedding in many households)
05/07/2023, 13:50 - Soumyadeep: Leaves the chat coz neither GenAI nor Creative :P
05/07/2023, 13:50 - Nirant: Fair, sincerest apologies
05/07/2023, 13:51 - Divya Tak: but in case of Indian data set on these Visual AI products, its not like Indians are a different "race" visually than other many many brown people like middle easterns and south americans etc
05/07/2023, 13:51 - Divya Tak: so limiting it to India for use case is an incomplete formulation
05/07/2023, 13:52 - +91 87420 23550: Beatoven is sourcing from indian artists by paying them for the music they record and give
05/07/2023, 13:52 - +91 87420 23550: Dataset creation

05/07/2023, 14:37 - +91 96194 91715: Stability released a paper about SDXL architecture, training and performance benchmarking. Summary and key takeaways...
Summary: The document discusses the advancements and limitations of the Stable Diffusion (SDXL) model for text-to-image synthesis. SDXL shows significant improvements in synthesized image quality, prompt adherence, and composition. However, it also has limitations such as challenges in synthesizing intricate structures like human hands, achieving perfect photorealism, addressing biases, mitigating concept bleeding, and improving text rendering. The document also compares SDXL with Midjourney v5.1, where SDXL shows a slight preference in terms of prompt adherence. The document concludes with suggestions for future improvements.

Key Takeaways:

SDXL outperforms or is statistically equal to Midjourney V5.1 in 7 out of 10 categories.

SDXL does not achieve better FID scores than the previous SD versions. This suggests the need for additional quantitative performance scores, specifically for text-to-image foundation models.

SDXL outperforms Midjourney V5.1 in all but two categories in the user preference comparison.

The model may encounter challenges when synthesizing intricate structures, such as human hands.

The model does not attain perfect photorealism. Certain nuances, such as subtle lighting effects or minute texture variations, may still be absent or less faithfully represented in the generated images.

The model’s training process heavily relies on large-scale datasets, which can inadvertently introduce social and racial biases.

The model may exhibit a phenomenon known as “concept bleeding” where distinct visual elements unintentionally merge or overlap.

The model encounters difficulties when rendering long, legible text.

Future work should investigate ways to provide a single stage of equal or better quality, improve text synthesis, enable scaling to much larger transformer-dominated architectures, decrease the compute needed for inference, and increase sampling speed.

"SDXL outperforms Midjourney V5.1 in all but two categories in the user preference comparison."
Yaaaay! 

It says hands not 100% perfect and some other minor issues like concept bleeding. But those will be overcome by community contributions soon enough.
05/07/2023, 14:40 - Divya Tak: What is concept bleeding?
05/07/2023, 14:42 - +91 96061 66934: Hey guys, I am an indie author who likes to make mini-collections of her poems and other literary experiments. But I'm not a designer. I have been wondering if any free AI tools help with book formatting and cover design (including the dimensions and stuff)
05/07/2023, 14:51 - +91 96194 91715: In stable diffusion try something like "man wearing red jacket". The rest of the image will also have a reddish tint or hue or some random objects in the image will end up being red
05/07/2023, 14:51 - Divya Tak: ah got it

06/07/2023, 10:21 - +1 (647) 676-7815: A bit naive question at this point but i am trying to understand this at a fundamental level

Why is Midjourney so much better than any other existing offerings for text to image?
06/07/2023, 10:22 - Nirant: RLHF with 4-way ranking loss!

No one else has that
06/07/2023, 10:23 - +91 74980 76111: Any links to this? Would like to read up more on it.
06/07/2023, 10:23 - +1 (647) 676-7815: Thanks
Plz explain 4 way ranking loss and how to achieve this?
06/07/2023, 10:24 - +91 74980 76111: Would love to hear from @917407651462 and @919619491715 on this
06/07/2023, 10:25 - +91 96194 91715: Midjourney is out of the box because RLHF is built into the product.
Stable Diffusion gives you more tools and control but it takes some work to achieve Midjourney levels of output
06/07/2023, 10:26 - +91 96194 91715: Nirant is probably a better person to explain details of 4 way ranking loss
06/07/2023, 10:29 - Nirant: I assume folks are familiar with ranking losses or pairwise losses. 
Here is one way of thinking (in context of LLMs) to use them: https://arxiv.org/abs/2305.18290

My _best guess_ is that Midjourney is able to iterate and move faster because they've figured a way to backprop this loss 

Happy to elaborate on the ranking scoring/losses itself if that's helpful
06/07/2023, 10:32 - +1 (647) 676-7815: Plz do share more

06/07/2023, 11:58 - Divya Tak: Hello everyone, a PSA, rule of thumb for this group, if something requires GitHub links as solutions, it either belongs in DMs or on another group.
06/07/2023, 11:59 - Divya Tak: While understanding the tool part of what AI can do is super fun and interesting and fascinating, this group is about conversations that can go beyond "how can I achieve this technically"
06/07/2023, 12:00 - Divya Tak: Nothing wrong with those conversations, but please be mindful that we actually want to bring people who don't care much for the tool or aren't super familiar with it.
06/07/2023, 12:00 - Divya Tak: And we want to encourage perspectives from people who don't own GitHub pages :)

06/07/2023, 12:03 - Divya Tak: There is a very fun and active group in the community called deep media, where a lot of people would be happy to answer the technical questions of what model to use, how to train, where to deploy specific techniques. You can join that one if it feels like a lot of challenges you face for your ai creative projects are technical in nature.
06/07/2023, 12:32 - Divya Tak: Since there are a lot of new folks here, who haven't been a part of the GenAI community, here is an overview of our groups. 

*AI for creatives* - If you are interested in the aspects of what and why you're building with AI, and you're a musician, artist, writer or more. _(you are here)_

*Deep media : generative art* - for all the juicy technical discussions about building things using AI. 

*Women in AI* - if you are women or non-binary and working in the AI space

*Generative AI startup ecosystem* - for founders and investors

*AI policy and philosophy* - if you're interested in the cultural, social implications of AI and want to understand and be involved in conversations about that and in thinking about the unanswerable questions. 

*The GenerativeAI group* - the OG group <This message was edited>
06/07/2023, 12:41 - Ambika: For those new to prompting - I made a guide for a company. It is usable on almost all Stable Diffusion platforms. Not plugging but the guide is free for all to read.

07/07/2023, 00:15 - Vamshi: Maxis did really cool generative and procedurally generated art work of the non AI kind (although it was all called AI anyway 😄). After the Sims, during Spore, they magically integrated techniques from the 4K demoscene into their procedural animation system.

Old school AI that you can tear apart to see all the building blocks, no mechanistic interpretation black magic required.

It used to be that the game industry was the earliest adopter of any tech
07/07/2023, 10:41 - Divya Tak: There are plugins for gpt in both UE and Unity afaik
07/07/2023, 10:41 - Divya Tak: And people are making games using those too

07/07/2023, 10:42 - Vamshi: Yeah I’m aware of these
07/07/2023, 10:43 - Vamshi: I guess it’s a tricky area for them too

07/07/2023, 10:45 - Divya Tak: Yea! The conversation systems that you can make! Though as charu and i are already running into it as a challenge during playtesting, players' expect actions for a conversation system are so much different if it feels real. So we are having to rethink design philosophy for our puzzles.

07/07/2023, 10:50 - Vamshi: Haha, not really too many things.
Focus is on the studio/space for now, but I’d like to turn the interactivity in the visuals into an app if it’s not too much of a digression from the content.
07/07/2023, 10:53 - Vamshi: The gravity of the past pulls me towards tech, but I’m trying to stay true to the music this time, so avoiding any natural pivots into tech
07/07/2023, 10:54 - Vamshi: I do love tech, it’s just I want to interchange the roles of the horse and the cart between tech and music this time.
07/07/2023, 11:02 - Divya Tak: I love that so many people here are multi disciplinary
07/07/2023, 11:06 - +91 96771 41491: Whoaa I didn’t know this
07/07/2023, 11:08 - +91 96771 41491: How does Unreal compare with Unity for VR? I keep seeing more Unity related stuff overall, in this space.
07/07/2023, 11:42 - Vamshi: I did some very broad checks, so Charu may have better comments.

I found that Unreal is better if you want uh potentially do more cinematic and realistic stuff.

Unity supposed to be easier to work with and web deployment is more straightforward.
07/07/2023, 11:43 - Vamshi: *to
07/07/2023, 11:44 - Vamshi: Of course there’s the Apple angle now
07/07/2023, 11:44 - Vamshi: Unity is the official partner for  vision OS
07/07/2023, 11:44 - Vamshi: And Unreal the official adversary
07/07/2023, 11:45 - Divya Tak: official adversary?
07/07/2023, 11:52 - +91 96771 41491: Epic vs 🍎
07/07/2023, 11:52 - ~ Shubhra Prakash left
07/07/2023, 11:53 - +91 96771 41491: “cinematic and realistic”, that’s interesting 😃
07/07/2023, 12:04 - Charu Tak: yea that's true, Though when you start making for VR (Lets say quest 2) You are anyway so heavily limited by the chip that we try to avoid fancier graphic techniques. I have used both engines a lot and if you are making a 3d experience/movie/ bigger game unreal wins easily, but for 2d, lighter things unity does better. 

Personally I prefer developing on unity but that's just because the development environment I prefer there, plus it crashes just a tad bit less xD
07/07/2023, 12:05 - Charu Tak: Chip -> the android chip powering the headset
07/07/2023, 12:06 - Vamshi: Yeah they’re quite focused on virtual production and big AAA studio features
07/07/2023, 12:08 - Vamshi: Yes there was a big law suit and Apple almost banned all unreal engine games or something like that, very fuzzy on the details myself
07/07/2023, 12:10 - Divya Tak: because so many games get made for the apple ecosystem that they afford to remove an engine XD
07/07/2023, 12:49 - +91 96771 41491: I wonder if VisionPro with it’s two “powerful “ chips will be a step up.
Do you develop on Unity for Windows or Mac? Assuming it’s the former 🙂
07/07/2023, 12:51 - +91 96771 41491: Since this isn’t exactly AI for creatives stuff - probably should take this discussion private or if there’s a VR related Telegram group or similar that you may know. 
Appreciate all the pointers
07/07/2023, 12:52 - Divya Tak: There is a creative coding telegram
07/07/2023, 12:54 - Hasan: I would assume it’ll work very similar to the iPhone/iPad development chain.
07/07/2023, 12:57 - +91 96771 41491: I’m on that already :)
07/07/2023, 12:59 - Hasan: Honestly iPad is very stable when it comes to handling serious graphics. I would assume that would translate to the headset as well. The reviews says they have really reduced the hardware/tracking delays to negligible. I think that’ll go a long to improve the experience overall.

07/07/2023, 16:53 - +91 91585 40496: While there is still a lot of scope for improvement, it's very powerful and user friendly. 

New Photoshop Beta comes with a bunch of plugins along with Generative fill and they are very impressive.
07/07/2023, 16:53 - +91 98181 14547: Yep, used it for some personal photos. I feel it's not that great at following the prompts to the T yet. But is still quite powerful for generic use cases.

07/07/2023, 21:43 - Shamik Sen Gupta: Its pretty useful /describe in terms of getting the bot ‘thinking’ and then take that to chatgpt, rewriting prompts and bringing it back to Mj
07/07/2023, 21:44 - Shamik Sen Gupta: There are many ways of playing it, visual and words prompts. /seed is also a very useful often overlooked command. TW mentioned above does a while article on how to use seeds and multiprompts.

08/07/2023, 19:32 - Divya Tak: It's if you want to make your own models or run things on your own system that you need to think about your system requirements

09/07/2023, 10:07 - Shamik Sen Gupta: A note about creative usage of 
/describe command in MJ. 

This has probably been spoken about by others elsewhere, but I haven’t seen or read anything , so I thought I’ll drop a note here.

Give MJ an image to describe. Ideally nothing very famous like Hopper’s work or Klimt or Diane Arbus. Something slightly off the beaten path or even personal would do.

Mj will come up with *four prompts* to describe the image, and oftentimes it will mention names of artists who’s work this emulates as ‘inthe style of so and so…’

Some of these names will be random artists that the bot has studied in its data set, or even just regular users off the internet.

But sometimes it will throw up some important names and you can deep dive into an artist’s work via the link MJ gives… could be an artist or an art movement. For eg when I shared some images a while back it gave me a number of prompts -

Sunil Das. - whose work I love and was great to revisit

Bikash Bhattacharya  - I have grown up seeing a lot of his work

Gerhard Richter - one of the most important modern painters of our times, i didn’t know of his existence so that was a great discovery🥷

Barbizon School - pre-Van gogh art school that influenced him, especially Jean francios millet 

Dansaekhwa art movement - a korean monochrome art movement from the 1970s

There were many more names in the prompts that I haven’t yet checked.

So, essentially even of you don’t make some art on MJ you can use the bot to lead you to some really good curation, and this might not happen with a straight up search on google. 

Happy dives down the rabbit holes.

09/07/2023, 10:27 - Shamik Sen Gupta: 1. Yeah absolutely, in fact there is some lawsuit already on this… the free usage from the entire internet and everybody

2. This is also true, though luckily it did name a few women artists in several of my seraches, but the bias definitely exists, its learnt from the sourcr
09/07/2023, 10:31 - Ambika: Cool. 

I’m really keen that we shift from luckily to accurately. 😅
09/07/2023, 10:31 - Shamik Sen Gupta: And its not mentioned her…  in some instances it doesn’t mention the actual artist at all, even though a search match could probably work.
09/07/2023, 10:31 - Ambika: I still recommend that google search (where you can drop the image) over describe
09/07/2023, 10:32 - Ambika: Not only not mentioned they have considered that the style of other male artists
09/07/2023, 10:32 - Shamik Sen Gupta: Would you get a series of possible keywords that lead you to make new discoveries?
09/07/2023, 10:32 - Ambika: So it’s not just erasure by absence it’s erasure by replacement

09/07/2023, 10:33 - Ambika: Meaning*
09/07/2023, 10:34 - Shamik Sen Gupta: Via google image search will you get a range of names… suggestions, possible art movements
09/07/2023, 10:36 - Ambika: I don’t know.
09/07/2023, 10:37 - Ambika: I think they more you seek outside midjourney the better
09/07/2023, 10:37 - Ambika: The other process I find helpful is to research the shit out of one artist. Then you learn about their work at a deeper level and find resonance. And also several similar or adjacent pieces.
09/07/2023, 10:37 - Ambika: This will enrich your outputs a lot more

converted that to open pose then used the same prompt with the same seed
to generate the next frame
10/07/2023, 23:07 - +91 98118 01278: Not sure, maybe that last frame's latent noise can help in maintaining previous one's information more 🤔

10/07/2023, 23:43 - Mihir Mumbai: McK published a report about usecases of generative AI in fashion.

https://www.mckinsey.com/industries/retail/our-insights/generative-ai-unlocking-the-future-of-fashion


Here's the summary

Foundation models and generative AI can be used across the fashion value chain.

Merchandising and product:
- Convert sketches, mood boards, and descriptions into high-fidelity designs (for example, 3-D models of furniture and jewelry).
- Enrich product ideation by collaborating with AI agents that generate creative options (for example, new ideas, variations) from data (for example, past product lines, inspirational imagery and style).
- Customize products for individual consumers at scale (for example, eyeglasses based on facial topography).
Supply chain and logistics:
- Support negotiations with suppliers by compiling research.
- Augment robotic automation for warehouse operations and inventory management through real-time analytics (for example, insights enabled by augmented reality, or AR).
- Tailor product return offers based on individual consumers.
Marketing:
- Identify and predict trends to improve targeted marketing from unstructured data (for example, consumer sentiment, in-store consumer behavior, omnichannel data).
- Automate consumer segmentation at scale to tailor marketing initiatives.
- Generate personalized marketing content based on unstructured data from consumer profiles and community insights.
- Collaborate with AI agents to accelerate content development and reduce creative blocks for in-house marketing teams.
Digital commerce and consumer experience:
- Structure and generate sales descriptions based on past successful sales posts.
- Personalize online consumer journey and offers (for example, web pages, product descriptions) based on individual consumer profiles.
- Tailor virtual product try-on and demos to individual consumers (for example, clothing try-on, styling recommendations).
- Enhance intelligent AI agents (for example, conversational chatbots, virtual assistants) and self-service to address advanced consumer inquiries (for example, multilingual support).
Store operations:
- Optimize store layout planning by generating and testing layout plans under different parameters (for example, foot traffic, local consumer audience, size).
- Optimize in-store labor to avoid bottlenecks such as gaps in staff allocation and theft detection through real-time monitoring of video data.
- Support AR-assisted devices to better inform workforce in real time on product (for example, condition, assortment, inventory, recommendations).
Organization and support functions:
- Coach sales associates to sustain successful “clienteling” relationships via real-time recommendations, feedback reports, and high-value consumer profiles.
- Develop individualized training content for employees based on role and performance.
- Enable self-serve and automate support tasks (for example, HR tickets, accounting for large documents, review of legal documents).
10/07/2023, 23:43 - Mihir Mumbai: this is like a list of future job descriptions ^
11/07/2023, 00:08 - +91 87420 23550: Nice. This can be used for storyboard + style = comic panels
11/07/2023, 00:10 - +91 87420 23550: Does Mckinsey have such reports for other sectors and corresponding usecases?
11/07/2023, 00:18 - Mihir Mumbai: i'm not sure. McK has waaaay too much being published every week. I haven't been able to keep tabs :)

11/07/2023, 01:28 - Devanshu Tak: test*
11/07/2023, 09:23 - +91 86191 47622: anyonetried playgroundai.com, curious if it is better than MJ/Dalle E
11/07/2023, 09:25 - +65 9069 0114: Are these QR codes 99% stable now? Heard on forums that they were only working like 75% time when deployed in the real world environment
11/07/2023, 09:26 - Nirant: That sounds about right
11/07/2023, 10:19 - Divya Tak: This is so fascinating
11/07/2023, 10:25 - Divya Tak: I've been thinking about how the roles of concept art and creative direction will fundamentally change shape because "creating options" and "changing direction" are cheaper but that means that one needs more clarity and vision
11/07/2023, 10:33 - Shamik Sen Gupta: dealing with that right this moment😱
11/07/2023, 10:34 - Shamik Sen Gupta: Our capabilities to make more 'finished', closer to reality concept images have drastically upscaled, client and agency imaginations haven't.
11/07/2023, 10:35 - Shamik Sen Gupta: But their appetite for being spoon-fed has gone up. That means, 6 months back ppl used their minds to imagine what a pencil sketch would look like in reality, after wireframe, after rendering, through iterations... people had make that effort. Now they wanna see a finished batmobile overnight, with textures, details and tailwind!
11/07/2023, 10:36 - Divya Tak: Honestly I don't even know how to internally sort through that, because even for my mind, I'm used to "roughs" looking like "roughs"
11/07/2023, 10:37 - Divya Tak: Ha polish != Finish is a new concept
11/07/2023, 10:39 - Shamik Sen Gupta: Roughs are still roughs, AI bots don't understand language like we do, that's the biggest dissonance, we have to contend that its still a hot or miss in getting the damn bot to design something on prompting. You still have to take it off its hand and work on it, do the rigour, tweak the fuck out of it till it kinda looks like what you had in mind. Client and agency are already expecting to see exactly what figment of imagination was discussed last evening, finished the morning after.
11/07/2023, 10:39 - Shamik Sen Gupta: hit*
11/07/2023, 10:39 - Shamik Sen Gupta: anyway rant over haha
11/07/2023, 10:40 - Divya Tak: Hahaha
11/07/2023, 10:59 - Ambika: it does take a few run to get them to be precise and there is no guarantee from one artwork to the next of the being able to use standardised settings

25/07/2023, 10:23 - +91 96112 56611: I wonder about the legal complexities surrounding commercial licenses for Midjourney and Firefly, especially in US context.

If a claim surfaces that they used specific images for training their models, would their client companies be implicated too?

Could anyone guide me towards insightful pieces or discussions on this topic?
25/07/2023, 10:26 - +91 96112 56611: I ponder, has anyone delved into the quality control mechanisms for large-scale image production from these tools?

How can we automate the QC process, ensuring we avoid generating images that are peculiar or incongruous to our users?

25/07/2023, 13:03 - Mihir Mumbai: I have just one anecdotal data point towards this discussion. A brief stint I did as a user behavior researcher at Here Solutions in 2018 for their automotive self driving data business. 

They needed humans to manually tag the data to train their ML model to recognize things on it's own. They had data from some 18 sensors, and was typically a few terrrabytes per data set. 

Their main centre for manual QC and training is in Airoli, Navi Mumbai. They had hired some 8000 (mostly B.Com) graduates to sit and tag the data all day. And they had plans to scale it up to 20,000 by 2020. So Who knows how large their operation actually is. 

All their tagging and QC was done using internally developed tools. When I was there, they had developed some 30+ tools over a decade, each time to suit a particular purpose. It was meant to be perfectly streamlined to handle the kind of data they have, suit their operational and corporate practices, and most importantly, adjust the interface and workflows as per the behavior of their employees observed while using the tool. 

So it was basically improving the QC+tagging tools for efficiency while the employees were using them. 

One type of data from one sensor was being tagged with 75% efficacy by their machine. After about 6~7 months of 200 humans tagging their data, the machine reached the required 97% efficacy and the team was moved to work on another tool, for a different data set.
25/07/2023, 13:03 - Mihir Mumbai: i imagine QCing the outputs of any AI tool will be similar
25/07/2023, 13:04 - +91 96112 56611: Thank you for sharing

25/07/2023, 13:04 - Mihir Mumbai: and in the recent news, this troubling story
https://www.technologyreview.com/2023/06/22/1075405/the-people-paid-to-train-ai-are-outsourcing-their-work-to-ai/
25/07/2023, 13:04 - Mihir Mumbai: welcome~!
25/07/2023, 13:06 - Mihir Mumbai: related: more humans in low income regions being paid to train AI
https://time.com/6247678/openai-chatgpt-kenya-workers/
26/07/2023, 07:12 - +91 96194 91715: Data preparation and tagging might just become a mainstream full time job for millions.
26/07/2023, 07:16 - +91 96194 91715: Character consistency and prompt adherence are 2 big challenges we deal with at Dashtoon on a daily basis. Short answer is you can’t always automate it. With AI it’s garbage in, garbage out. So a human needs to pass judgment on the quality of input data as well as output.
26/07/2023, 07:19 - +91 96194 91715: Judging quality of output by a human is needed especially for generative models like Stable Diffusion. With something like an image classifier model the standard practice is to split data into train and test sets and quickly get a performance score. A lot more nuances to that, but you can say that quality evaluation there can be automated to a large extent to tell you quantitatively whether your model performance is good or bad
26/07/2023, 07:20 - +91 96194 91715: For something like Stable Diffusion you enter abstract territory like “What does good even mean?”
26/07/2023, 07:22 - +91 96194 91715: I may get fantastic output when I’m creating generic images, but it may fail to create consistent faces of a single character
26/07/2023, 07:24 - +91 96194 91715: So the same model that works for one use case may not work for another. Or the same model may need very different input parameters to work for both use cases
26/07/2023, 07:29 - +91 96194 91715: Part of what we do at Dashtoon is to try and squeeze every last drop of juice out of our chosen model within a set of necessary constraints. I can do that only if I as a human pass judgment on the quality of output.
26/07/2023, 07:45 - Ambika: Out of curiosity what are these quality evaluations?
26/07/2023, 07:48 - +91 96194 91715: Character consistency evaluation to see if a trained character is consistently looking the same. 
Evaluating prompt adherence of a new model. 
Evaluating whether a new controlnet is consistently giving an output that meets a production benchmark
26/07/2023, 07:49 - +91 96194 91715: And there are new ones every day
26/07/2023, 07:49 - Ambika: Right
26/07/2023, 07:52 - +91 96194 91715: But it doesn’t end there because while these are controlled quality experiments there’s only so much you can do in a “lab environment”
So after this QC you also need to test the same thing in a content production environment. Like from the workshop to the racetrack
26/07/2023, 07:54 - +91 96194 91715: Sometimes the results hold up but sometimes they don’t for reasons you can’t predict in a controlled QC environment. Such as the output quality vs time taken ratio doesn’t make sense for a creator who’s working on a production schedule
26/07/2023, 07:55 - Ambika: That’s a given
26/07/2023, 07:55 - Ambika: Is there no way to rhlf the tests
26/07/2023, 07:55 - Ambika: 😂

https://beastoftraal.com/2023/07/26/ai-in-advertising-more-misses-than-hits-so-far/
26/07/2023, 11:40 - Divya Tak: I feel like this is a lack of creativity and imagination on the part of ad makers. They would need to change how they think about advertising rather than just "you can hear your name" part
26/07/2023, 11:41 - +91 78975 80575: Yes the name part is just boring.
26/07/2023, 11:42 - Heer Shingala: Yeah! Creatives often don't know what all AI can do. 😅 So they make a plan first and then check with tech people, resulting in underutilization
26/07/2023, 11:42 - +91 78975 80575: What do you think are better usecases?
26/07/2023, 11:44 - Divya Tak: One would be just being able to execute more expensive visual styles. Things that would only be possible with a major budget, but doing it more often for even smaller things
26/07/2023, 11:46 - Heer Shingala: I think REAL personalisation is a must - AI can be used to make anyone say anything, if they get celebs to say the names, that'll be very well received.
26/07/2023, 11:50 - +65 9069 0114: Current lip-synching/word replacement doesn't do very well for more than 1 sentence. Gan.ai has perhaps the best tech in this and that's their guideline as well
26/07/2023, 12:05 - +32 486 63 43 41: Have you personally tried their solution?
26/07/2023, 12:05 - +91 78975 80575: Interesting, I think name is very basic form of personalization.
The better variables to use for personalization are my interest, people I look upto, dislikes 
etc to create a video that is better for me.

For Example, I am 18 year old student, who like playing cricket and looks upto Virat, I have been recently browsing lots of cricket bats online.

The creative folks can create a video in which they can explain how virat kohli was in the same dilemma of choosing bat when he started and which parameters he used to select one.
26/07/2023, 12:08 - +91 78975 80575: This can be automated at scale using AI
26/07/2023, 12:12 - Heer Shingala: It's also about the placement of the personalisation. As the article says, in case of the SRK ad, it didn't do well coz the personalization came towards the end so people lost interest once they'd watched the ad onc
26/07/2023, 12:16 - Kunal Questt: Talking about personalisation, this one by Caravana is an attempt at personalisation at a whole new level. Check this one out:

26/07/2023, 16:17 - Divya Tak: Does personalisation like this matter? Like at a certain level, the millions of videos number doesn't matter as an end user. I have an example in the gaming world. No man's sky promised (and delivered) trillions of worlds, but because they are not thoughtfully crafted, the worlds dont feel as fascinating as something that might be even slightly more handcrafted and be much smaller.
26/07/2023, 16:41 - Devanshu Tak added +91 75067 79882
26/07/2023, 16:52 - Kahran Singh: Yeah something Divya and I were talking about a few days ago is how BMW did a series of movies for a certain part of their audience in the 2000s called ‘the chase’…. I think the more incredible personalization opportunity right now is to be able to create things of that kind of production value for more segments of the audience than was possible in the pre-AI when production cost was so high you had to make trade-offs.
Going after low cost high volume production with AI seems possible but likely to get lost in the noise of semi personalized ad experiences that already exist
26/07/2023, 17:55 - Prasad Crypt: super personalized ads be like my neighbour trying to sell me amway products. - hey prasad, long time no see, i see you are wearing sweater and it looks a bit dirty. hey i have this amway detergent for woolens, why dont you buy 😬

28/07/2023, 13:45 - Divya Tak: I am unsure if character animation has been cracked yet @918003141801 do you know of any tools?
28/07/2023, 13:49 - +91 87420 23550: As far as i understand
Can use Dreambooth to make it learn particular objects and characters. And generate images. Can use runway to convert images to 4 seconder videos and end frame again to create longer vids. 

Can do live action to animation with consistent characters for more control
28/07/2023, 13:54 - +91 96739 91902: I have experimented with runway, but struggled with character  continuity
28/07/2023, 13:55 - +91 96739 91902: I will try the live-action to animation approach
28/07/2023, 14:59 - +91 91585 40496: Runway Gen-2 with Midjourney image input is a promising solution.
28/07/2023, 15:00 - +91 91585 40496: Not 100% though, but the best we have right now.
28/07/2023, 15:02 - +91 91585 40496: Also,

01/08/2023, 00:41 - Vamshi: Haha yes, reminiscent of older things too like MTV
01/08/2023, 00:48 - Divya Tak: Yes! I feel like that sort of thing always comes back whenever there is a new wave of technology. Like memes in the early Facebook time also used to somewhat feel like that

01/08/2023, 01:38 - Vamshi: New toys to play with
01/08/2023, 02:24 - Vamshi: Another very interesting phenomenon is the increasing “sexiness” of technology
01/08/2023, 02:24 - Vamshi: Earlier thought of as mechanical and boring
01/08/2023, 02:24 - Vamshi: Just one example
01/08/2023, 02:24 - Vamshi: This lecture

01/08/2023, 02:26 - Vamshi: Will be fun to do a collab which delves into the details of the attention mechanism
01/08/2023, 02:27 - Vamshi: “Stochastic Gradient Descent” has a hellishly devilish ring to it, as well
01/08/2023, 02:27 - Vamshi: 😁
01/08/2023, 02:31 - Vamshi: The lecture is science rather than technology, but yeah, same idea

01/08/2023, 16:38 - +91 96112 56611: why not on twitter?
01/08/2023, 16:39 - Nirant: Twitter is not visual, it's also unusually harsh and critical to early projects
01/08/2023, 16:39 - Divya Tak: visual social media
01/08/2023, 16:39 - Divya Tak: Also, x*
01/08/2023, 16:42 - +91 96112 56611: Oh

ohk
01/08/2023, 16:43 - Divya Tak: I didn't know about the harsh part, but I just know that Twitter is worse. Could do threads too, but again same problem, its not visual.

01/08/2023, 17:53 - Ambika: Instagram is definitely better for creative showcase no
01/08/2023, 20:45 - +91 96194 91715: I’ve wanted to start an Instagram account for my art for so long now. But I’m pretty bad at social media and between a hectic job, creation time and family stuff I don’t really have time or energy left to manage one. Would love to be part of such a collective though!

02/08/2023, 00:13 - +91 97079 48595: Yeah, in some parts the voice conversion seems to have not worked out properly. Might be due to the song, or the model. Will try out other songs and check
02/08/2023, 00:14 - Divya Tak: how did you make it

02/08/2023, 01:04 - Divya Tak: that was interesting
02/08/2023, 08:39 - Vamshi: These are really cool
02/08/2023, 08:41 - Vamshi: Actually I’d budgeted for and completed design for a small but dedicated recording room as part of my ongoing project, and I’ve been a bit hesitant to go ahead with it, given the pace of these algorithms
02/08/2023, 08:43 - Vamshi: The workflow for vocals could change significantly in the coming years, but I’m not sure whether it will reach a point where the recording room gets replaced
02/08/2023, 08:45 - Vamshi: The music production software ecosystem has evaded the consolidation and venture backed model for decades
02/08/2023, 08:45 - Vamshi: Particularly because of so many European companies that don’t like the that way of working
02/08/2023, 08:51 - +65 9069 0114: Silly question: I am looking for driver videos as part of building a synthetic video (text to video). Tried some from unsplash but need them recorded in a certain style and lip movement for best results. Has anyone tried paid recording sample (30 second) videos off fivrer (or any other sites?) Need American and spanish faces. Tips welcome on best freelancer(s) for this.
02/08/2023, 08:56 - Nirant: cc @918742023550 have you explored this?

02/08/2023, 09:47 - +91 96194 91715: Interesting
02/08/2023, 09:56 - Vamshi: Sorry I didn’t finish that thread - I meant to say that of someone like Spotify releases a foundational model, it could suddenly push the music production ecosystem into super app and venture backed mode

02/08/2023, 15:31 - +91 96771 41491: He mentions Videoleap app for AI effects. I’m curious how he gets these amazing ones. I tried Videoleap and most of the templates don’t seem to work for >10 seconds.

02/08/2023, 16:01 - Divya Tak: this seems quite small no? like the individual parts that were animated seem quite small
02/08/2023, 16:16 - Divya Tak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XmxIK9p0SNM @918003141801 shared this fantastic video with me. very timely for the discussion around AI art
02/08/2023, 16:46 - +91 96771 41491: Ah okay, so slice up and apply effects individually?
02/08/2023, 16:47 - Divya Tak: yeah i think so? I haven't played around with this tool
02/08/2023, 16:47 - Divya Tak: but i suspect it is a clip and then use model to make it animate kinda thing
02/08/2023, 16:49 - +91 96771 41491: Nice thanks. I’ll play around with it some more.

Nice to meet you all!
02/08/2023, 17:39 - Ambika: She has some amazing experiments with integrating ai in her creative workflow
02/08/2023, 17:41 - +91 89569 99808: It's api is for free??
02/08/2023, 17:41 - Ambika: No api. You have to sign up
02/08/2023, 17:46 - +91 89569 99808: Anything's  api to build these models experiment ??
02/08/2023, 17:46 - Ambika: You’ll have to check in the other groups. We try to focus on the creative aspects here.
02/08/2023, 17:56 - Prasad Crypt: i had seen an article about ai few years ago (cant find it) which mapped artist vs critic to 4 quadrants. here critic means selector/judge -
1. human artist - human critic - traditional art
2. human artist - ai critic - classifiers to detect good art from human creations
3. ai artist - human critic - generative ai
4. ai artist - ai critic - goes weird pretty quickly
02/08/2023, 18:02 - Divya Tak: Please ask the questions in Deep media group
02/08/2023, 18:18 - +91 89569 99808: Okay 👍
02/08/2023, 18:56 - Vamshi: Looks fun
02/08/2023, 18:56 - Vamshi: For a moment I thought it was also doing style transfer on the audio
02/08/2023, 18:58 - Vamshi: I can’t recall if I’ve seen him play guitar before
02/08/2023, 18:58 - Vamshi: But I’m a big fan of GeoShred
02/08/2023, 19:04 - +91 96247 20488: Hi,

I am Dinesh Abiram,

I am urgently looking for someone to teach at university level HTML5, P5js and Figma. In Bangalore preferably people with Design experience.
02/08/2023, 19:04 - +91 96247 20488: Please DM
02/08/2023, 19:05 - +91 96247 20488: This is aimed at Screen Based outcomes
02/08/2023, 20:01 - +91 96771 41491: Ahh that’d be bleeding edge, no?

02/08/2023, 20:26 - +91 96771 41491: Same! Do you use it in any of your work? I’m trying to use it in my practice and want to include it in performances
02/08/2023, 20:54 - Vamshi: I really enjoyed it, for a few weeks when I first got it, I introduced it to my mom, who got completely addicted to it.

She had some mind block with the her voice, but it was completely gone with GeoShred, which is the only instrument she took to, ever.
02/08/2023, 20:54 - Vamshi: She still plays everyday
02/08/2023, 20:54 - Vamshi: That’s the bigger reason I’m a big fan of it
02/08/2023, 20:54 - Vamshi: Also, the touch tracking is super intuitive
02/08/2023, 20:55 - Vamshi: I tried to use it as a MIDI controller with a VST Roland-303 emulation
02/08/2023, 20:55 - Vamshi: But it wasn’t as intuitive as the built in mapping to their own synths
02/08/2023, 20:56 - Vamshi: Basically wanted to try some kind of performance aesthetic with acid bass 😄
02/08/2023, 21:09 - Vamshi: Other than the knob twiddling aesthetic that is
02/08/2023, 21:14 - +91 97124 76022 joined using this group's invite link
02/08/2023, 21:23 - +91 96771 41491: I like that it’s possible to achieve glides in several instruments, which is arguably less intuitive in MIDI keyboards, even with pitch bend etc
02/08/2023, 21:28 - Vamshi: I think this part Audio to audio models will really shine
02/08/2023, 21:29 - Vamshi: a lot of people can hum and scat tunes, and using that as input to generate an instrument rendition is a super promising direction
02/08/2023, 21:30 - Vamshi: This the the problem that got me into both audio and neural networks, but over time I’ve lost the interest to solve it 😂
02/08/2023, 21:31 - Vamshi: I think a VST which does this is around the corner
02/08/2023, 21:31 - +91 96771 41491: Interesting. Do you know if anyone is working on this idea?
02/08/2023, 21:32 - Vamshi: I think I saw a link somewhere but it’s lost in my memory, will post if I locate it
02/08/2023, 22:18 - +91 70928 62522: Like google magenta
02/08/2023, 22:19 - +91 70928 62522: https://sites.research.google/tonetransfer
02/08/2023, 23:03 - Vamshi: Oh thanks for this!
02/08/2023, 23:03 - Vamshi: The VST been around for a year !!
02/08/2023, 23:03 - Vamshi: https://github.com/magenta/ddsp-vst
02/08/2023, 23:04 - Vamshi: Hadn’t seen that
02/08/2023, 23:09 - +91 97079 48595: I checked a bit about GeoShred, after the name sounded interesting 😁
Saw the video on their website and was surprised to hear that 30% of performers are from India!!
Certainly on my list now
03/08/2023, 00:14 - Vamshi: It’s popular for the microtonal expressiveness
03/08/2023, 00:16 - Vamshi: Bedrock of all Indian stuff
03/08/2023, 00:17 - Vamshi: Now you can also play on it and then run it through tone transfer!

03/08/2023, 11:00 - Ambika: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/6dbURrwM-gU
03/08/2023, 11:01 - +32 486 63 43 41: Please feel free to reach out if you have any questions
03/08/2023, 11:03 - Divya Tak: Ooh so cool.
03/08/2023, 11:03 - Divya Tak: I had never heard of this. This is so awesome
03/08/2023, 12:45 - Vamshi: Pitch bends have been around, but the feel of the glide is extremely intuitive with GeoShred
03/08/2023, 12:46 - Divya Tak: Not pitch bend but the way he explained the singing
03/08/2023, 12:46 - Divya Tak: Which I guess is pitch Bend but I hadn't seen it in that context
03/08/2023, 13:05 - +91 96771 41491: Agreed. I wonder if some sort of haptic feedback will improve the experience even more

03/08/2023, 14:38 - +65 9069 0114: Relevant job (please spread for karma points 🙏🏽)

Hiring mavericks and do-ers! Full time and interns with python and genAI exposure (stable diffusion, vectorDB, etc) at 88 Ventures (88ventures.org), which is investing in and building AI-first companies. 

In doing so, we are revisiting everything on first principles. What ideas are relevant for VC like investments? Why? And, also building in-house a portfolio of microSaaS with a common theme. For example, we have picked up AI first marketing stack for SMBs this year. Mostly in stealth mode and can explain more verbally to selected candidates.

Actions speak. We have gone from 0 to 30 people. Launching 2 products this month (and next 2 month after). We work in small teams and move fast. No team will ever be more than 7 people (pizza rule!)

If keen then mail us at nitin@88ventures.org

03/08/2023, 14:44 - Abhigyan Ai Group: Hi all, trying to create invisible QR codes, stuck at ControlNet
03/08/2023, 14:48 - Divya Tak: @919008639111 had a thing on gooey for that iirc
03/08/2023, 14:49 - Ambika: Yes. We do. I can share it here if that’s allowed. Or DM.
03/08/2023, 14:51 - Divya Tak: share share
03/08/2023, 14:55 - Ambika: https://gooey.ai/qr-code/
03/08/2023, 14:55 - Ambika: <Media omitted>
03/08/2023, 14:56 - Ambika: good it needs feedback anyway :P
03/08/2023, 15:24 - Vamshi: I ended up meeting Nick Porcaro, the sole developer behind the app (not sure if anyone else joined later ), a few years back.
03/08/2023, 15:25 - Vamshi: We had some fun discussion on a GeoShred standalone instrument
03/08/2023, 15:26 - Vamshi: Solo Dev, but of course Jordan Rudess is behind a lot of design and usability side I guess
03/08/2023, 15:26 - Vamshi: Something like that could have force feedback
03/08/2023, 15:28 - Vamshi: I asked him about the magic behind the touch tracking
03/08/2023, 15:28 - Vamshi: Because no other touch instrument compares
03/08/2023, 15:30 - Vamshi: That was in 2019 when the buzz around AI/ML was heating up (possibly GPT had just been announced) and so he said I can assure you there’s no ML there 😄
03/08/2023, 15:33 - Vamshi: Julius Orion Smith III designed a lot of the DSP, for which the app has an interesting architecture
03/08/2023, 15:34 - Vamshi: It’s all done in a DSP/math VM called Faust
03/08/2023, 15:35 - Vamshi: Super interesting, and a lot of the physically modeled instruments you see in the GeoShred library are written in it
03/08/2023, 15:36 - Vamshi: https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~rmichon/publications/doc/IFC-18-PM.pdf
03/08/2023, 15:37 - Vamshi: It would be cool if there ported something like the Neural DSP that Ashith shared, into it.
@917092862522
03/08/2023, 15:37 - Vamshi: *they
03/08/2023, 15:51 - Vamshi: I skimmed through Meta’s audio craft release, but wasn’t able to guess whether it can be adapted for audio to audio type workflows
03/08/2023, 15:51 - Vamshi: For most musicians, music originates directly, and not through language
03/08/2023, 15:53 - Vamshi: That said, DAW based production on laptops is all MIDI patterns, which is arguably quite similar to language, as is piano roll notation etc
03/08/2023, 15:53 - Prado Photographer requested to join.
03/08/2023, 15:54 - Vamshi: But it’s a very interesting progression of the art
03/08/2023, 15:55 - Prado Photographer joined from the community
03/08/2023, 15:55 - +91 88755 44546 joined from the community
03/08/2023, 15:55 - Vamshi: Musical creation is progressing from a very visceral, physical and almost tribal communion experience, to the most cerebral, abstract and industrial consumption experience.
03/08/2023, 15:56 - Vamshi: The electronic music scene is a twisted celebration of the artful subversion of industrial consumption into a tribal communion.
03/08/2023, 15:57 - +91 96771 41491: Wow. Quotable quote 🙏🏽 Or tweetable tweet 😵
03/08/2023, 15:57 - Vamshi: For me, this type of subversion is an essential guiding principle to making a technologically advanced artistic community
03/08/2023, 15:58 - Vamshi: Sorry about the verbiage, blame it on the times ✌️
03/08/2023, 15:59 - +91 96771 41491: No no, was a genuinely good way to put it
03/08/2023, 16:00 - +91 96771 41491: Even with something like musical notation, the industrial consumption began, I’d say.
03/08/2023, 16:02 - Divya Tak: What do you mean? 😂 I can't parse this
03/08/2023, 16:03 - Vamshi: The whole rave scene is super high tech, but anti consumerism atleast in its intentions
03/08/2023, 16:03 - Vamshi: Burning man another example
03/08/2023, 16:04 - Vamshi: Takes the fruits of hard tech and turns it on its belly by using it to make a tribal experience
03/08/2023, 16:04 - Vamshi: Going backwards using advanced tech
03/08/2023, 16:04 - Vamshi: Hence subversion
03/08/2023, 16:05 - Vamshi: “Backwards” is a scalar
03/08/2023, 16:06 - Vamshi: You can go forwards with the technologically controlled dimension, but go backwards to address basic human needs that art aspires to fulfill in the first place
03/08/2023, 16:07 - Vamshi: In a very different scene
03/08/2023, 16:07 - +91 96771 41491: Humanisation of tech as some people say?
03/08/2023, 16:07 - Vamshi: Yeah
03/08/2023, 16:09 - Vamshi: I’m not an art historian
03/08/2023, 16:09 - Vamshi: 😄
03/08/2023, 16:10 - Vamshi: Maybe there’s someone in the chat!
03/08/2023, 16:11 - +91 96771 41491: Ooh interesting. I’ve heard of Faust. Assuming there’s some sort of wrapper for iOS
03/08/2023, 16:12 - +91 96771 41491: Yep 
https://github.com/grame-cncm/faust/blob/master-dev/architecture/api/doc/iOS.md
03/08/2023, 16:12 - Vamshi: libfaust is the embeddable version
03/08/2023, 16:13 - +91 96771 41491: I am pretty certain there’d be someone in the AI philosophy group
03/08/2023, 16:16 - Vamshi: Haha art history seems like art discussion, but the lazy version
03/08/2023, 16:17 - Vamshi: Just kidding no offence meant to art historians
03/08/2023, 16:17 - Vamshi: Among my favourite people
03/08/2023, 16:21 - Hasan: I like how you phrase it. Have been working in similar direction for my personal art practice. Utilising technology to build experiences inspired by aesthetic and mythology of Rajasthan. Also experimenting with Indian classical music, this domain have not seen much technological innovations. Both for educational and performance purpose.
03/08/2023, 16:31 - Vamshi: So cool - do say more
03/08/2023, 16:31 - Vamshi: It’s nice to hear the stories
03/08/2023, 16:31 - Vamshi: And on the note of productivity, might set context for a jam
03/08/2023, 16:32 - Vamshi: What’s that festival that happens in Rajasthan
03/08/2023, 16:33 - Vamshi: That Prince of Alsisar thing
03/08/2023, 16:36 - Vamshi: Is there some connect between Ajmer, Qawwali and Rajasthani traditions ?
03/08/2023, 16:36 - Vamshi: It’s all fuzzy for me
03/08/2023, 16:41 - Hasan: Have shared this before, but this is the first one I have finished prototyping. Now working on the next few installations in this series. Will share once it’s ready. 
03/08/2023, 16:41 - Hasan: <Media omitted>
03/08/2023, 16:41 - Hasan: That’s magnetic fields music festival.
03/08/2023, 16:42 - Hasan: No, not at all. But this is something I have been studying, Specially Sufi music tradition is fascinating.
03/08/2023, 16:43 - Vamshi: Super fun!
03/08/2023, 16:58 - Divya Tak: oooh damn! how did you make this? this is so awesome!
03/08/2023, 17:01 - Hasan: This is OCR + content search + style transfer + projection mapping. In the future I’ll replace the content search with video generation model, once it’s fast enough.
03/08/2023, 17:06 - Divya Tak: how fast is video generation right now?
03/08/2023, 17:08 - Hasan: Open models don’t even run on my local gpu. Hosted API are too expensive and takes more than a few minutes, last I tried.
03/08/2023, 17:10 - Divya Tak: Accha
03/08/2023, 17:10 - Mihir Mumbai: this is amazing~
03/08/2023, 17:29 - Soumyadeep: This is why I am on this group. ❤️
03/08/2023, 17:43 - Ambika: Nice one Hasan! 🥰
03/08/2023, 17:50 - +65 9069 0114: @918890571387 great stuff and thanks for sharing with the community.
How do you do "style transfer"?
03/08/2023, 17:53 - Hasan: Two methods, one is real-time neural style transfer and second is simple opencv based multiplication with texture. Depends on the resources I have on the system since this is all offline.
03/08/2023, 18:06 - +91 96194 91715: As an example, there's music created just for TikTok and Instagram reels these days.
03/08/2023, 18:09 - +91 96194 91715: I think this has been happening for all art in some form or the other since the very beginning within the cultural context of the time.
03/08/2023, 18:15 - +91 96194 91715: Another great example is Andy Warhol's work of painting cans of Campbell soup. Elevating the most common, mundane easily identifiable layman's object into art.
03/08/2023, 18:17 - +91 96194 91715: Warhol was fascinated by industrial mass production of art. He would have loved what Stable Diffusion offers
03/08/2023, 18:19 - +91 96194 91715: In my opinion something as simple as a book is industrialization of the art of hand lettering and calligraphy
03/08/2023, 18:25 - +91 96194 91715: Heck, the entire field of graphic design is art for industrial purposes. Crafted to evoke a predetermined targeted and specific reaction in the brain
03/08/2023, 18:32 - +91 99402 37330: Does the graphic appear on the video after processing or does it work like AR where it projects it live? :o
03/08/2023, 18:33 - Hasan: This is projected on the board. No processing or editing done to the video.
03/08/2023, 18:34 - +91 99402 37330: Projected as in using an actual projector IRL? (sorry for the n00b questions 😅)
03/08/2023, 18:43 - Prasad Crypt: what is art - In the canvas of cosmic consciousness, art unveils the symphony of the metaphysical, gracefully dancing to the rhythm of the eternal hallucination. The painter's brush becomes an oracle, caressing the ethereal realms of perception, orchestrating colors that blend and meld in a harmonious cacophony of unmanifested potential. Artistic expression transcends boundaries, creating a luminous tapestry where the unmanifested dreams come alive in a dance of unknown unknowns.  🤔
03/08/2023, 19:28 - Hasan: Yes.
03/08/2023, 19:38 - +91 99402 37330: That's amazing :o
03/08/2023, 19:40 - Ambika: @918890571387 is it part of something larger or just figuring some new stuff out.
03/08/2023, 19:44 - Hasan: I’m working to build a whole show with multiple exhibitions all with indian mythological influences. Still looking for resources to build this and showcase this.
03/08/2023, 19:46 - +91 98117 36511 updated the message timer. New messages will disappear from this chat 7 days after they're sent, except when kept.

03/08/2023, 22:39 - +91 96194 91715: I can help with generating illustrations for this. Animations, not yet. But soon
03/08/2023, 22:40 - Hasan: Thank you so much. I would DM you for further discussion.
03/08/2023, 22:42 - Vamshi: You doing any music for this ?
03/08/2023, 22:43 - Vamshi: If you want to integrate something with unreal engine I can join in, and also with the music !
03/08/2023, 22:43 - Vamshi: You’re familiar with the wind horse folks from Hyderabad ?
03/08/2023, 22:43 - Vamshi: Hamza Rahimtulla
03/08/2023, 22:44 - Vamshi: They do a lot of folk music with house
03/08/2023, 22:44 - Vamshi: I’d love to do something like that
03/08/2023, 22:44 - Vamshi: Can contribute!
03/08/2023, 22:44 - Vamshi: Session recording and the overall production
03/08/2023, 22:45 - Vamshi: https://windhorserecords.com
03/08/2023, 22:48 - +91 96771 41491: Very cool Hasan. That looked like Hindi - and you mentioned OCR. Count me in if there are plans to add more languages too.
03/08/2023, 23:00 - Hasan: I’ll take a look, this sounds amazing.
03/08/2023, 23:00 - Hasan: Of course would love to. ✨
03/08/2023, 23:25 - Vamshi: Yeah, I really liked the general direction of this release

03/08/2023, 23:53 - Hasan: That’s a friend, I’m on the midi keyboard, playing basic house drums and a synth.

@919982084784 @919980317594 @919008639111 and I are doing this panel next week at Bic if any of you would like to come see us!
04/08/2023, 00:06 - Vamshi: Oh, nice! So this is in Indiranagar? Can’t recall if I’ve been to this place before. What is it ?
04/08/2023, 00:07 - Vamshi: Nice art !
04/08/2023, 00:07 - Divya Tak: Yea! Bic does a lot of nice events! I like seeing their music performances a lot. But their talks and all are damn fun too
04/08/2023, 00:07 - Vamshi: Very chill vibe, guess this is Goa 🙂
04/08/2023, 00:07 - Divya Tak: They hosted chocolate festival last year too
04/08/2023, 00:08 - Divya Tak: I think the the last 1.5 years I've seen piano recital, jazz performance, chamber music, Indian classical, a bharatnatyam performance and many more things
04/08/2023, 00:08 - Vamshi: Oh so cool
04/08/2023, 00:09 - Vamshi: Is this panel part of a larger evening ?
04/08/2023, 00:09 - Hasan: Yes, this is Goa. A random house party which turned into a jam session.
04/08/2023, 00:10 - Hasan: Will this be recorded? Not in Bangalore but would love to hear.
04/08/2023, 00:10 - Divya Tak: Thanks! Midjourney helped 😂😂
04/08/2023, 00:10 - Divya Tak: Nai this is just one thing
04/08/2023, 00:10 - Divya Tak: I am unsure. I will check
04/08/2023, 00:16 - Vamshi: Hahaha, what does the prompt look like ?
04/08/2023, 00:29 - Vamshi: Haha those are the best

05/08/2023, 19:08 - Divya Tak: Why are ai made eyes always slightly off
05/08/2023, 19:09 - +91 96194 91715: What can be improved in these eyes?
05/08/2023, 19:09 - Divya Tak: They aren't a pair
05/08/2023, 19:09 - Divya Tak: Shape, angle, where the guy is looking
05/08/2023, 19:10 - +91 96194 91715: Ok I can edit this
05/08/2023, 19:10 - Divya Tak: Eye isn't the problem, eyes end up being an issue
05/08/2023, 19:11 - Divya Tak: I just find it curious why it always happens in AI generated images <This message was edited>
05/08/2023, 19:11 - +91 96194 91715: You mean they don't work as a pair is supposed to?
05/08/2023, 19:11 - Divya Tak: Yes
05/08/2023, 19:11 - Divya Tak: I'm not on my machine otherwise would have drawn and told
05/08/2023, 19:12 - +91 96194 91715: I think I get what you mean though. Editing it now.
05/08/2023, 19:13 - +91 96194 91715: This wasn't a 1 shot generation anyway. Plenty of inpaint - edit - inpaint cycles
05/08/2023, 19:13 - Divya Tak: <Media omitted>
05/08/2023, 19:13 - +91 96194 91715: Got it
05/08/2023, 19:14 - Divya Tak: Also the way the eyes sit in socket anatomically is also different both both eyes

05/08/2023, 19:15 - Divya Tak: Don't models get trained on eyes as a pair
05/08/2023, 19:15 - Divya Tak: Why is it messing up the pairing behaviour

05/08/2023, 19:16 - +91 96194 91715: But I just noticed there's a patch under his left eye that doesn't have a shadow
05/08/2023, 19:17 - Divya Tak: Ha that part is fine but both sit differently
05/08/2023, 19:17 - Divya Tak: Like the socket size and shape is different for left and right eye

05/08/2023, 19:34 - Divya Tak: Do you paint over it?
05/08/2023, 19:41 - +91 78975 80575: How did you do it? I am interested to learn it
05/08/2023, 19:43 - +91 96194 91715: Yeah paint, move things around. Everything photoshop lets me do
05/08/2023, 19:44 - Divya Tak: Hmmm
05/08/2023, 19:45 - Divya Tak: There was a cool video i remember seeing long time back about how to warp for better anatomy. Will share if I find. Might be helpful. Or you might have already seen
05/08/2023, 19:45 - +91 99307 80975: Hi Guys have any of you used midjourney artworks for print? Book covers/ illustrations, posters etc?
05/08/2023, 19:46 - +91 96194 91715: No no please share
05/08/2023, 19:47 - Divya Tak: Will try and find
05/08/2023, 19:48 - +91 96194 91715: I’m no photoshop master either. I know the basics but trying to become a power user
05/08/2023, 19:50 - +91 96194 91715: The first thing I ever used Midjourney for was to gift a friend a canvas print artwork for his birthday. This was back in October 2022 so it’s definitely better now
05/08/2023, 19:51 - +91 96194 91715: I think I printed a 12x12 inches canvas print for him. Didn’t need to do anything to increase the resolution either. Max MJ resolution did the job
05/08/2023, 19:53 - Divya Tak: That's not 3600*3600 right
05/08/2023, 19:53 - Divya Tak: How did you get good quality print
05/08/2023, 19:54 - +91 96194 91715: I went to the print shop and showed him and asked if it would work 😛
05/08/2023, 19:54 - +91 99307 80975: Like a 4k output will do? And was it pixelated in anyway?
05/08/2023, 19:54 - +91 96194 91715: But if I were to do it now I would definitely upscale it
05/08/2023, 19:55 - +91 96194 91715: What size do you want to print?
05/08/2023, 19:55 - Divya Tak: Rule of thumb is 300ppi
05/08/2023, 19:55 - Divya Tak: For good quality
05/08/2023, 19:55 - +91 96194 91715: Yup
05/08/2023, 19:55 - Divya Tak: Ppi is pixel per inch
05/08/2023, 19:56 - Divya Tak: When I'm painting I double that and paint. It comes out much sharper that way when printing
05/08/2023, 19:58 - +91 99307 80975: So 600 ppi should be good?
05/08/2023, 19:59 - Divya Tak: Yea that is ideal. Thats the standard for comics etc when printing iirc
05/08/2023, 20:00 - +91 99307 80975: Super. Thank you guys! Im going to attempt designing graphics for a children's poem I wrote sometime ago. Hope it goes well! 🤞

05/08/2023, 20:14 - +91 96194 91715: MJ artwork makes for great personalised gifts for weddings, housewarmings etc
06/08/2023, 07:48 - Prasad Crypt: several thoughts. one is problem with training data which has normal pics and mirrored pics (mirror selfies and flipped images).
for real bodies, the patterns of asymmetry are not symmetrical. for example, irl right shoulder should be more often slightly lower than left (right hand dominance) but in training pics, there are more pics that have left shoulder lower. so ai images should be less accurate for what they call fluctuating asymmetry.

other issue is structure fineness (for drawing) varies in eye region, like the socket has less fineness but at the center when eyelid ends and sclera starts, its superfine - so it often feels like eye socket was drawn first and then eye was placed in the there.

because individual eye itself is slightly symmetrical, there used to be positional training issues earlier, like ai would draw right eye similar to left eye. maybe they solved it but we see some artifacts of that problem 🙈
06/08/2023, 10:33 - Divya Tak: Ah how interesting. And this is not a "more data" will solve it kinda problem? What needs to happen?
06/08/2023, 10:55 - Ambika: It’s practice just like when you are real artist <This message was edited>

06/08/2023, 10:56 - +91 81590 63404: I did an A3 size T shirt print for a mid journey output... Put it into bigjpg to scale ... And Photoshop to edit it a bit... Turned out good actually
06/08/2023, 11:10 - +91 99307 80975: With 300 ppi or 600 ppi?
06/08/2023, 11:14 - Mihir Mumbai: i suppose no one has explicitly pointed it out in the training data?
i feel like i would have seen something like it in the hundreds of captcha puzzles i see ever month.
06/08/2023, 11:44 - Prasad Crypt: not more but better training data might help. fluctuating asymmetry is developmental. for example forward neck posture during childhood causes issues with teeth alignment etc, on those lines. i wish there was a face generation model on the lines of protein folding models. but probably pipe dream 😂

14/08/2023, 19:29 - +91 96194 91715: Hey sorry for the late reply, was on a road trip. CLIP guidance applies the CLIP text encoder model to every step of the diffusion process which should in theory make the image much closer to the prompt text. But there is a generation time and memory tradeoff because of which I have not found any use for it personally

Personally I'm a very bad artist but love telling stories, so image generation really spoke to me. I'm overly invested in training various models. Hope to keep learning from this community.

14/08/2023, 23:25 - Vamshi: Oh, and you didn’t think it relevant to post it here? Or did I miss it !?
14/08/2023, 23:27 - Divya Tak: I like how they are getting a scolding because you're basically like "how dare you do cool things without sharing with us"
14/08/2023, 23:27 - Ambika: its more creative coding and genAI group is larger
14/08/2023, 23:28 - Ambika: so 🤷‍♀

14/08/2023, 23:33 - Vamshi: It was great to see the connection here
14/08/2023, 23:33 - Ambika: ❤
14/08/2023, 23:33 - Vamshi: Enjoyed going through your vision, story etc
14/08/2023, 23:35 - +91 96771 41491: Aw, let me think about this ❤️
14/08/2023, 23:35 - Ambika: thanks @918971040239 appreciate it! we are thinking that the "code" title will change in script as per the city where its hosted so kannada if bangalore, and so on
14/08/2023, 23:35 - Vamshi: I just returned from a reunion with old friends all far along in some journey in deep tech, but pursuing the arts in parallel.

The vulnerability and authenticity that comes from sharing a physical space is hard to replicate.
14/08/2023, 23:35 - Ambika: DM me - we can figure something out
14/08/2023, 23:35 - Ambika: come for the last day! :)
14/08/2023, 23:36 - Vamshi: Haha, full on FOMO. Udaipur beckons 🙂
14/08/2023, 23:36 - Ambika: I already DM-ed you!
14/08/2023, 23:37 - Vamshi: Having said that, there’s an online experience which came close
14/08/2023, 23:38 - Vamshi: A Finnegans wake group reading that I did during the pandemic with 15 - 20 random people from around the world.
14/08/2023, 23:39 - +91 96771 41491: Will do. 
Yeah now there’s too much FOMO
14/08/2023, 23:48 - Vamshi: Exactly
14/08/2023, 23:51 - Nanditi: Omg! So much hype. You guys are making our workshop sound cool to ourselves 😂
15/08/2023, 00:09 - Vamshi: I think the credit is much deserved even just to conceptualise it
15/08/2023, 00:09 - Vamshi: Wishing you the best with the turnout etc
15/08/2023, 00:09 - Ambika: thanks!
15/08/2023, 00:09 - Nanditi: Aaww thanks 💜
15/08/2023, 00:21 - Nanditi: I just now figured how it reached the handpan group and who is the one going 😂
15/08/2023, 00:21 - Nanditi: Late realisation

15/08/2023, 19:58 - Nirant: It's interesting to see that how the moment ZIRP ended — a16z is back to it's tech roots
15/08/2023, 19:58 - Nirant: This message was deleted
15/08/2023, 19:59 - Nirant: They've hired some stellar infra engineers and built a bunch of such working demos
15/08/2023, 19:59 - Nirant: I wonder how many of the other global VCs at that AUM can even think this way
15/08/2023, 20:35 - Divya Tak: Can you explain in simple English? @917737887058
15/08/2023, 20:35 - Divya Tak: Or anyone else
15/08/2023, 20:37 - Pratyush Choudhury: 1/ I don't think at that AUM, you can consider yourself as a VC 

2/ This is definitely technical and all, but this is exactly the same what they did for crypto - hire techies, researchers, do a lot of content, drive a narrative, invest & exit

(P.S: I have some very good friends there - really admire what they're doing)
15/08/2023, 20:42 - Divya Tak: Simple English pls pratyush?
15/08/2023, 20:42 - Pratyush Choudhury: 😅

15/08/2023, 20:55 - +91 99301 29844: Is it an overlay ontop of an ai generated image or the entire qr is generated?
15/08/2023, 21:12 - +91 94235 63226: Entire QR is generated
15/08/2023, 21:15 - Nirant: Sincerest apologies. ZIRP is when the bull run was going on. It stands for Zero interest rate phenomena. AUM is Assets under Management — e.g. your mutual fund invests money on your behalf? That's an asset under their management.
15/08/2023, 21:15 - Ambika: Relevant to creative group?
15/08/2023, 21:16 - Nirant: Helpful if you're trying to understand the context in which people make art tools live, yes. 
15/08/2023, 21:16 - Nirant: And helpful if you want to make money from art ever
15/08/2023, 21:16 - Nirant: But yes off topic, will move this convo to main

15/08/2023, 21:26 - +91 94235 63226: URL is linked to your paytm number. How your regular qr always works, this would also be mapped to the same link like regular qr
15/08/2023, 22:07 - Vamshi: Late to the party - I shared this for you only - game, chat, simulation emergent narrative
15/08/2023, 22:07 - Vamshi: That’s about as much as I read into it
15/08/2023, 22:08 - Vamshi: 😄
15/08/2023, 22:09 - Vamshi: Not the emergent narrative of the VC kind, but hey so long as it’s fun !
15/08/2023, 22:10 - Vamshi: I remember the first YC startup school. I think it was Catrina Fake who pivoted from a massively multiplayer game to a photo sharing website
15/08/2023, 22:10 - Divya Tak: What's vc kind of emergent narrative

15/08/2023, 22:21 - Vamshi: There’s been a lot of serendipity with art and big money lately
15/08/2023, 22:22 - Vamshi: Flickr is very old
15/08/2023, 22:22 - Vamshi: Of course
15/08/2023, 22:23 - Vamshi: Not a technical term 😄
15/08/2023, 22:25 - Vamshi: Hey since Meera offered to attribute some quote to be in the past, may I request to have this one attributed to me instead.

“The money is part of the medium”. The artistic medium that is.

<vanity request ends/>
15/08/2023, 22:25 - Vamshi: to *me
15/08/2023, 22:26 - Vamshi: Ok that’s definitely a post for the undeserved vanity window, so over and out 😄
15/08/2023, 22:29 - Vamshi: But @919008639111 this is quite in the spirit of your statement, I think somehow money is a kind of volatile part of the artistic medium
15/08/2023, 22:29 - Vamshi: Similar to religion and other raw human needs
15/08/2023, 22:30 - Vamshi: I love Terrence McKennas take on this
15/08/2023, 22:30 - Ambika: I’m just wondering if creative group should be about work - how can we get people to open up about it
15/08/2023, 22:30 - Vamshi: Yeah agreed
15/08/2023, 22:30 - Ambika: Yes ofc money is important
15/08/2023, 22:31 - Vamshi: No I like that focus
15/08/2023, 22:31 - Ambika: I don’t know how other mods feel
15/08/2023, 22:31 - Ambika: We can jointly figure I suppose
15/08/2023, 22:33 - +91 94877 05530: a really interesting piece of ai use in game design i came across recently- npcs that interact with you in real time (not based on a script- something random every time with teal time audio too) 

https://www.thefpsreview.com/2023/05/25/new-matrix-awakens-unreal-engine-5-demo-lets-players-talk-to-npcs-in-real-time/

15/08/2023, 22:36 - Vamshi: Yea this was posted in one of the groups earlier too
15/08/2023, 22:37 - Vamshi: Chat with NPCs and emergent narrative really getting some cool immersive-ness to it
15/08/2023, 22:37 - +91 94877 05530: was thinking of a way how gen ai could be integrated into a game storyline- so a story could progress in different ways depending on what way a character interacts within a npc in the gameplay- each filler decision storylines are generated by ai- given a beginning (context) and the different ways the story could progress (say 2 alternatives that have been developed by the team- they would remain the same but they way to approach to them would be different for each player dependingon their interactions.) <This message was edited>
15/08/2023, 22:38 - Vamshi: @919953076613 the original post was on a similar vein - I was curious if you or someone else had come across that framework in your work
15/08/2023, 22:40 - Vamshi: I can imagine this being a hugely addictive game with interaction analytics powering a behavioural profile - evil and yet a far too natural end game
15/08/2023, 23:02 - +91 94877 05530: a few days back a friend was explaining how different games are designed to incentivize different player behaviors (good/evil). 

he gave the example of red dead redemption 2 for incentivizing good behavior; they have a honor system which essentially incentivizes you to act good in the game - not shoot npcs, help people out leading to better outcomes in the game ( https://youtu.be/n83VgG71miA) 

contrasted this with a game like last of us 2 in which the player is essentially incentivized to do bad (a cut scene in the gameplay for example which does not move forward if you don't choose the option to kill the character- which is also the only option btw.)
15/08/2023, 23:29 - Divya Tak: Haven't kept up with these kind of things yet
15/08/2023, 23:34 - Divya Tak: I have huge unresolved thoughts on addictiveness by design
15/08/2023, 23:59 - Vamshi: Maybe I got it mixed up, someone was working on llm based NPCs ?
15/08/2023, 23:59 - Divya Tak: Yea we are
15/08/2023, 23:59 - Divya Tak: Me and chsru
16/08/2023, 00:00 - Divya Tak: But we haven't kept up with the tech experiments that are happening in the space
16/08/2023, 00:00 - Divya Tak: Things change fast, and ultimately it's the game design which is the key
16/08/2023, 00:00 - Vamshi: Ah ok! Yeah I just heard about this too!
16/08/2023, 00:00 - Vamshi: Definitely
16/08/2023, 00:00 - Divya Tak: So right now focusing on figuring those pieces as we're building
16/08/2023, 00:01 - Divya Tak: And plus building with AI is interesting because free form conversation as a mechanic is not fully explored. So how do we do it in a way that feels valuable and not gimmicky is important

17/08/2023, 19:02 - Vamshi: I tried their max/vst version a long time back
17/08/2023, 19:02 - Vamshi: Was sorta fun, but didn’t feel like something super new
17/08/2023, 19:03 - Vamshi: Haven’t tried it recently
17/08/2023, 19:03 - Vamshi: I think the new stuff is way more interesting though …
17/08/2023, 19:07 - Vamshi: To be more specific, the instrument morphing was very useful, but something that could also be done with a MIDI controller for example
17/08/2023, 19:13 - Vamshi: Tone transfer was recently in the chat here
17/08/2023, 19:14 - Vamshi: Looks very fun! Similar to the older stuff, but more interesting because it’s sensitive to a lot of the time domain dynamics
17/08/2023, 19:15 - Vamshi: Picking up envelopes etc nicely from the source and applying them to the target, along with the desired timbre changes
17/08/2023, 19:34 - +91 70928 62522: A friend of mine and myself were planning to write a song with music written completely using tone transfer. Will share the results if they turn out good!!
17/08/2023, 19:34 - Harsha Dashtoon: I used magenta studio about 3 months ago to check out drumify. Wasn't really impressed with it. Their other tools like continue and interpolate were very mediocre as well. Their generation from scratch doesn't really have a lot of controls either. 
Already existent plugins like superior drummer, scaler 2, midi madness, etc do what magenta studio does, way better, with more control.
17/08/2023, 19:39 - Harsha Dashtoon: I think you are referring to this
https://magenta.tensorflow.org/ddsp-vst
Magenta Studio, is more of a midi madness sort of tool. (Confusing because both have magenta in name)
17/08/2023, 19:46 - Vamshi: I’ve been to their site on and off over the years, I think they had some VST or Max/MSP object with a web GUI a very long time back in their first release, can’t recall if the same thing became ddsp vst
17/08/2023, 19:47 - Vamshi: Anybody here in Google ?
17/08/2023, 19:48 - Vamshi: I used to follow Douglas Eck from a past life when he was around the corner in university of Montreal
17/08/2023, 19:48 - Vamshi: That’s how I stumbled upon magenta
17/08/2023, 19:48 - Vamshi: It’s pretty sweet that they keep plunging at this kind of work
17/08/2023, 19:48 - Vamshi: Google Research is like the new Xerox PARC
17/08/2023, 19:49 - Vamshi: A lot of amazing stuff starts there
17/08/2023, 19:49 - Vamshi: And then someone else will make the phase transition to the real usable innovation
17/08/2023, 19:50 - Vamshi: Plugging
17/08/2023, 19:52 - Vamshi: So much latent magic in the magenta research (pun intended 😄)
17/08/2023, 19:52 - Vamshi: How could we turn this into a jam ?

I have 30k+ tweets data from 30 months of posting on twitter and want to convert it into a book

happy to pair with someone on this

or
I can give my 30k tweets for  anyone to use for this experiment (consider the data and whatever you do with it free of any copyright)

I am just interested in seeing it compiled in 30 to 40 themes as good notes
18/08/2023, 10:46 - Nirant: Naval Ravikant and Thiel hired college students to do this for them fwiw
18/08/2023, 10:46 - Nirant: Plenty of others use ghostwriters in India and elsewhere
18/08/2023, 10:46 - Nirant: Not sure if LLMs are good ghostwriters yet

18/08/2023, 13:56 - Vamshi: Anyone from luma in our community ?
18/08/2023, 13:58 - Nirant: @919445636004 yes
18/08/2023, 13:58 - Nirant: Karan is the creator/founder of Luma Labs

18/08/2023, 14:05 - Vamshi: @919445636004 big fan of this, although I’m more in the “watch demo” phase right note 😄
18/08/2023, 14:12 - Vamshi: My use case is live streaming from a set in unreal engine composited with a real camera feed. 

Hope to use your plugin for unreal engine for this.
18/08/2023, 14:13 - Devanshu Tak: Check out LightTwist
18/08/2023, 14:17 - Vamshi: Looks interesting!
18/08/2023, 14:23 - Vamshi: I was only aware aximmetry which was a bit less flexible than the unreal engine approach, and way more expensive
18/08/2023, 14:24 - Vamshi: It’s still in a private beta ?
18/08/2023, 14:25 - Devanshu Tak: They will release in a few weeks
18/08/2023, 15:36 - Kahran Singh: You can do some version of this just by feeding it to gpt4 and asking it to analyze it. I gave it about 4000-5000 words of poetry I had written and asked it to describe my poetry and also used that “engineered” chat for writing other things — like I asked it to brainstorm some ideas for a different writing project, and also write and rewrite some things in “my” style.  
You will eventually hit max tokens but should work for your stated purposes
18/08/2023, 15:39 - Ambika: yes - this is viable solution - i dont think it needs more than gpt4 context window! :) well said @14259414613
18/08/2023, 15:40 - +91 96112 56611: Thank you @14259414613 

 will explore this
18/08/2023, 16:06 - +91 96896 96877: Hi fam!

I hope it's not a wrong place to ask!

But if anyone would like to teach intro to 2d digital techniques not AI ? (Photoshop and illustrator ) at Strate School Of design, can reach out to me!

It's a part time role!

TLDR; This is one of the first inroads that the law has made on our understanding of copyright in the AI gen age. The court ruled that images generated without direct user input cannot be copyrighted.


Thought this might be relevant for the creative community but please let me know if it better belongs to the AI and philosophy group :)
26/08/2023, 12:41 - Divya Tak: I wonder though what "direct user input"means
26/08/2023, 12:42 - Divya Tak: Because does getting a base from ai and then over painting work
26/08/2023, 12:42 - Harsha Dashtoon: Also wouldn't a prompt be "user input"?
26/08/2023, 12:42 - Divya Tak: Yea

26/08/2023, 14:21 - +31 6 49925262: Hi all 👋🏻! Thank you for adding me to this group @919008639111 ! I am Marjolein,  a speculative designer from the Netherlands, mom, gardener, storyteller. I experiment with AI for my future scenario work and to challenge/test/understand this mew technology.
I am @marjole.in on insta, and @wondermash.eu for work projects.
26/08/2023, 14:22 - Ambika: 🥳 hey @31649925262 please share any links you would like to share
26/08/2023, 14:22 - Divya Tak: Welcome welcome!
26/08/2023, 14:22 - Divya Tak: What kind of speculations do you design for
26/08/2023, 14:23 - +31 6 49925262: I actually read a similar case early this year, where an artist who created a graphic novel with AI generated images, was refused to copyright the comic book
26/08/2023, 14:27 - Nitin | SuperMinions.com joined from the community
26/08/2023, 14:28 - +31 6 49925262: I co-create future scenario’s with organisations to create actionable pathways to alternative and entangled (relational, rather than technological, although they are a part of it) futures.

My personal passion project is Birth Futures, where I explore the future of birth with midwifery communities in the Netherlands, Peru and India, visualized by the amazing Amritha Warrier (@vanille__punk) using partly AI generated textures and worlds.

https://www.wondermash.eu/projects/birth-futures
26/08/2023, 14:34 - Divya Tak: How interesting. Can you share more about how you even got into speculative design?
26/08/2023, 14:34 - Divya Tak: Also, do these workshops sorta act like community brainstorms?
26/08/2023, 16:09 - +31 6 49925262: Thank you for asking! Sort of, yes, we follow different methods for exploring current developments and extrapolating their impacts into the future. I choose speculating over data-drivm forecast to maximize difference with present world, so as to include manu diverse ideas and representations of the future
26/08/2023, 16:12 - +31 6 49925262: My career is a meandering and to the outside illogical path: from marine ecologist (study) to climate communications researcher, to founder of an information design studio to now freelance ‘future ecologist’. Central to all my jobs is storytelling, entanglements and a deep drive to disrupt paradigms that aren’t helping societies to flourish 😊✨🚀🤖🌸
26/08/2023, 16:14 - Divya Tak: what a cool career path! what kind of problem statements are you currently exploring, besides the birthing futures
26/08/2023, 23:58 - +31 6 49925262: I am doing a project in the town that I live (a medium sized village) and co-create future stories with people and children living here (hopefully) informing policy decisions and I teach at uni.
27/08/2023, 00:38 - Vamshi: Interesting!
27/08/2023, 00:38 - Vamshi: Haven’t heard the term “entanglements” before
27/08/2023, 00:39 - Vamshi: I started to think it’s something to do with the future and quantum entanglement
27/08/2023, 00:39 - Vamshi: 🙂
27/08/2023, 00:40 - Vamshi: But I see it’s something to do with self learning?
27/08/2023, 00:41 - Vamshi: Nice to meet you!
27/08/2023, 01:26 - +31 6 49925262: Ha no! It means like knots, things that are connected in a  bit of a messy way 😆
27/08/2023, 01:26 - +31 6 49925262: Nice to meet all of you too!
27/08/2023, 01:36 - Vamshi: Haha ok, “regular” entanglements
27/08/2023, 01:40 - Divya Tak: Did you get interested in future stories after you had a kid? Or was it something that always interested you? How did your creative process change after becoming a parent
27/08/2023, 02:14 - +31 6 49925262: I’ve always been a scifi nerd 🤖, buy having kids made my creative process more urgent. Less time, less sleep, less patience with things in  general 😆, but also more emphathy and a mismatch between the life I think everyone deserves and how our society is structures im such a way that alienates people, and not builds these deep connections that I think are what makes life worthwhile. I found after kids that I am a storyteller by heart and the future is a place where imaginations cam be projected to have a  impact: change the future.

But how about you all? What drives your work, is there a ‘higher goal’ and has this changed over your careers?
27/08/2023, 02:14 - +31 6 49925262: *sorry for the typos

27/08/2023, 02:16 - +91 81590 63404: I am curious as to how or if you address that aspect as well in your speculations
27/08/2023, 02:18 - +91 96507 49198: Prateek Arora is doing some great work when it comes to using AI for visual creativity

Just wanted to share these links
27/08/2023, 02:21 - Divya Tak: I don't know if there is a higher purpose to my making. I just like making things and that sense of joy just drives it. Sense of wonder/inspiration/joy/fun those kinda emotions?
27/08/2023, 02:39 - +31 6 49925262: You mean colonialism / decolonialism?
27/08/2023, 02:39 - +91 81590 63404: Yes
27/08/2023, 02:40 - +31 6 49925262: How so?
27/08/2023, 02:41 - +91 81590 63404: Just by the nature of departure from an ideology is a sort of relation
27/08/2023, 02:42 - Ambika: You have any reference
27/08/2023, 02:43 - +91 81590 63404: Like for eg. indofuturism might be a departure from the colonial past but that decisive departure itself is the tying thread
27/08/2023, 02:43 - +91 81590 63404: For eg. Prateek Arora's work itself
27/08/2023, 02:43 - Ambika: You mean in its populist tropes like the ai stuff or do you have a larger reference
27/08/2023, 02:44 - +31 6 49925262: What would you say makes futuring decolonial? I apprach it from multiple and relational perspectives, use methods from global north amd south, include different voices in stories and those I partner with, and am aware (or try to be) of my own biases in terms of Eurocentricity
27/08/2023, 02:44 - +91 81590 63404: Okay
27/08/2023, 02:45 - +91 81590 63404: I am curious as to how or if you address that aspect of colonialism in futuristic speculation
27/08/2023, 02:45 - +31 6 49925262: Do you mean that Indo/afrofuturism is defined by their pushback of western/colonial culture and therefore rooted in it?
27/08/2023, 02:46 - +91 81590 63404: Not to demean or attack anything in particular but rather also address that aspect
27/08/2023, 02:46 - +91 81590 63404: Yeah ... something like that
27/08/2023, 02:47 - +91 81590 63404: It's like you can only hate something you love  - or is it not... Sorry for the really bad analogy
27/08/2023, 02:49 - +31 6 49925262: What aspect exactly? Trying to understand your question? For example: I am situating the stories in  two countries from global south, and I do workshops before in each country where the midwives actually create the stories, I do not actively steer this direction. The stories come from extrapolating local impacts and place-based history and culture.
27/08/2023, 02:51 - +31 6 49925262: Than I aggregate these multiple stories into one birth story for each country. In the future extrapolations we do explore cultural paradigms and dogma’s, which might be (if broughy up)  the gender binary, nature-culture divide, individuality as ideal (this was the workshop in the Netherlands), or others, depending on what is raised by participants.
27/08/2023, 02:51 - +91 81590 63404: Exactly... So I was curious whether colonial ideology itself is taken into consideration in this process or is it embraced... So I guess it is embraced in the example that you shared
27/08/2023, 02:52 - +31 6 49925262: I do not understand how you conclude this
27/08/2023, 02:53 - +91 81590 63404: Like it's a very participant driven process
27/08/2023, 02:54 - +31 6 49925262: How is a participant driven workshop embracing colonial ideology?
27/08/2023, 02:55 - +91 81590 63404: Participants are all living in the modern context of a post colonial era correct?
27/08/2023, 02:58 - +31 6 49925262: I don’t know if all participants can be considered living in a modern society, if the nation states of peru and india are considered so, can all inhabitanta be considered so, and if so, are there human beings not living in the modern context of post colonial era?
27/08/2023, 02:58 - +31 6 49925262: I don’t want to cut off this interesting dialogue, buy it’s almost midnight here, and I have to go to bed. I’ll pick it up on the morning
27/08/2023, 02:58 - +91 81590 63404: So I just wanted to understand if the colonial lens is also a perspective through with the extrapolations are made and if yes then what are the implications or complications
27/08/2023, 02:59 - +91 81590 63404: Agreed...and that's also interesting
27/08/2023, 03:26 - Divya Tak: I am also unsure what you're asking. If people who make stories have been colonised in the past and you say those are colonial narratives then there is no way to have de colonised narratives.
27/08/2023, 03:27 - Divya Tak: Isn't the whole point of afro futurism and indo futurism to imagine futures from those nations and their unique cultural context and not have all the stories come from the west?
27/08/2023, 03:27 - Divya Tak: How is that colonial?
27/08/2023, 03:29 - +91 81590 63404: I was trying to understand if colonialism was a lens that is driving the speculations
27/08/2023, 03:29 - Divya Tak: Ha but how is this related
27/08/2023, 03:30 - +91 81590 63404: It's wasn't so much about whether it's colonial decolonial but rather how it emerges as you rightly pointed
27/08/2023, 03:30 - Divya Tak: If I make a story living in india about the female experience
27/08/2023, 03:30 - Divya Tak: How would colonial narrative fit here
27/08/2023, 03:31 - Divya Tak: Context : I am a woman born and living in india
27/08/2023, 03:32 - +91 81590 63404: They are not separate things rather overlapping... Now yes the story about the female experience is definitely the story about the female experience however if multiple lenses are being used my question was more about what kind of lenses are they
27/08/2023, 03:33 - Divya Tak: Hmm but your initial axiom was that futurisms are colonial in their roots
27/08/2023, 03:33 - Divya Tak: It wasn't that colonialism is a lens to possibly look at things from 🤔🤔
27/08/2023, 03:35 - +91 81590 63404: Well if you look at visual art - specific to futurism - as I had mentioned above - then the colonialist tropes kind of come out to a certain extent - again the question was if it was even a lens being considered...not that is has to be - and that one is better than the other
27/08/2023, 03:36 - +91 81590 63404: I mean what is indo futurism? And how is it different from futurism?
27/08/2023, 03:36 - Divya Tak: How do you mean?
27/08/2023, 03:37 - Divya Tak: The part about colonialist tropes in visual art
27/08/2023, 03:39 - +91 81590 63404: Like a picture of an Indian superhero family
27/08/2023, 03:39 - Divya Tak: Okay?
27/08/2023, 03:39 - +91 81590 63404: Just an example
27/08/2023, 03:40 - Divya Tak: Ha sure
27/08/2023, 03:40 - Divya Tak: Pictured
27/08/2023, 03:41 - +91 81590 63404: So whenever we talk about futurism specific to geographicql context especially the global south - they often have colonial roots
27/08/2023, 03:42 - Divya Tak: I didn't understand from the super hero example
27/08/2023, 03:42 - +91 81590 63404: Nevermind 😅
27/08/2023, 03:42 - Divya Tak: Like if you're saying that there would be a mishmash of some westernised concepts
27/08/2023, 03:42 - Divya Tak: Then sure
27/08/2023, 03:42 - Divya Tak: That's a part of it
27/08/2023, 03:42 - +91 81590 63404: Yes
27/08/2023, 03:43 - +91 81590 63404: Exactly
27/08/2023, 03:43 - Divya Tak: But that's not colonial by default
27/08/2023, 03:43 - +91 81590 63404: No it is not
27/08/2023, 03:43 - Divya Tak: That's just cultural mixing
27/08/2023, 03:43 - Divya Tak: If i ask you to imagine an Indian samurai
27/08/2023, 03:43 - Divya Tak: Or a yoruba Shaolin monk
27/08/2023, 03:43 - +91 81590 63404: Kalaripayatu meets Indian armour?
27/08/2023, 03:44 - Divya Tak: You are picking two concepts
27/08/2023, 03:44 - +91 81590 63404: Yes agreed
27/08/2023, 03:44 - Divya Tak: That's not a samurai
27/08/2023, 03:44 - Divya Tak: That's just an Indian warrior
27/08/2023, 03:44 - +91 81590 63404: Well we should feed it into midnourney and see what comes out
27/08/2023, 03:45 - Divya Tak: Like are there going to be cultural mixups from anything that is created today, especially considering that West exports most culture since last 100 years
27/08/2023, 03:45 - Divya Tak: Yrs
27/08/2023, 03:45 - Divya Tak: But that isn't colonial by default
27/08/2023, 03:45 - +91 81590 63404: Is it not?
27/08/2023, 03:45 - +91 81590 63404: 🤔
27/08/2023, 03:46 - Divya Tak: Especially if people of a nation in the global south are developing something, and we still keep colonial lens as a fundamental part of it then that's just denying the agency that those people have in shaping the elements of culture they see
27/08/2023, 03:46 - Divya Tak: This reminds me of berger's book "ways of seeing"
27/08/2023, 03:46 - +91 81590 63404: Well I think you are mixing two different things
27/08/2023, 03:47 - +91 81590 63404: One is accepting or embracing something resulting from a colonial influence
27/08/2023, 03:47 - Divya Tak: How is that colonial though
27/08/2023, 03:47 - Divya Tak: Will Japanese visual elements be considered colonial?
27/08/2023, 03:48 - +91 81590 63404: And the other being... A certain departure or decolonising actively
27/08/2023, 03:48 - Divya Tak: Or finger hearts (Korean) be colonial?
27/08/2023, 03:48 - Divya Tak: The element in of itself isn't colonial
27/08/2023, 03:48 - +91 81590 63404: I think that's where it becomes tricky
27/08/2023, 03:49 - +91 81590 63404: Colonialism emerged from a historical event
27/08/2023, 03:49 - Divya Tak: I think it's dismissive to say that futurisms are colonial by default 😅
27/08/2023, 03:49 - +91 81590 63404: And the current context of cultural intermixing is slightly different
27/08/2023, 03:49 - +91 81590 63404: And all of that goes into the other aspects of power and governance
27/08/2023, 03:50 - Divya Tak: But super hero example or futurist examples are much closer to the present cultural mixing
27/08/2023, 03:51 - +91 81590 63404: My brain is fried at this point
27/08/2023, 03:51 - +91 81590 63404: 🤯
27/08/2023, 03:51 - Divya Tak: Lol
27/08/2023, 03:51 - Divya Tak: This is mindblown emoji though
27/08/2023, 03:51 - Divya Tak: 😂😂
27/08/2023, 03:52 - +91 81590 63404: As I said
27/08/2023, 03:52 - +91 81590 63404: <Media omitted>
27/08/2023, 03:52 - Divya Tak: Lololol
27/08/2023, 09:02 - +91 97420 77077: Your work sounds a lot like what a branch of psychology and therapy practice: narrative practices is like. 

Participative approach to story telling, and then looking at places where they intertwine (entanglements) and then looking at the larger structures which are at play which forcibly shape our narratives and how our values and actions can in turn allow us to have power over ours. 

When you say futurism it is very similar to community documentation that we do in narrative practices

27/08/2023, 13:03 - Divya Tak: What are narrative practices in psychology? When does a therapist use it?
27/08/2023, 13:39 - +91 97420 77077: https://dulwichcentre.com.au/what-is-narrative-therapy/ 

The link gives a detailed idea of what narrative practices are. The uses ar more than therapy; community work, education, writing, journalism, filmmaking. Essentially anywhere you want to use storytelling. I use it in my work as a marketer and strategist in framing questions and research. 

In therapy it is used when asking you to renarrativise an event. Al therapists may not use it.
27/08/2023, 13:42 - Divya Tak: Thanks for sharing! This seems very intriguing
27/08/2023, 14:01 - +91 97420 77077: Super useful if you are looking to Center narratives around marginalised communities and their experiences. So when we approach from a space of privilege, how do we look past that
27/08/2023, 19:41 - +31 6 49925262: I feel like the dialogue has moved on a bit, and read some interesting things! Not sure if there were still open ended questions for me? 

I love the link to the narrative therapy article. I've heard from it, but this article is really informative. I particularly like the part about 'thin' and 'thick' stories. I read a lot of 'thin' future stories full of technofixes, one-sided perspectives and centered on/from northern nations perspectives. The rich/thick future stories (imo) contain descriptions of lives and relationships, just like described in the narrative therapy. So thank you for this insight @919742077077

30/08/2023, 23:06 - +91 96896 96877: just start with free

also when it comes to learning

there are 100000 tutorials you can look up in any language you'd like about any specific thing you can imagine!

i don't know your use case 
if you just want to do casual design you can start with tools like canva
30/08/2023, 23:07 - +91 95100 25096: I'm (super )noob
30/08/2023, 23:07 - +91 95100 25096: Never used it yet
30/08/2023, 23:12 - +91 96896 96877: there are tutorials for exactly that
30/08/2023, 23:14 - +91 96896 96877: trust me just look up 

Because it can be quite frustrating when someone points out basic things.
30/08/2023, 23:16 - +91 95100 25096: Ohh 😮 understood

08/09/2023, 12:26 - Vamshi: How much of that can be done with open source tools? How much have they done on their own?
08/09/2023, 12:28 - Vamshi: Very cool, that it’s a kid right out of high school killing it with this thing
08/09/2023, 12:29 - Vamshi: Came across it via this demo

08/09/2023, 12:32 - Vamshi: I remember the audiocraft demos coming pretty close to this
08/09/2023, 12:33 - Vamshi: Or was it tone transfer
08/09/2023, 12:34 - Vamshi: 1 million users is pretty amazing for this
08/09/2023, 12:34 - Vamshi: In 1 month
08/09/2023, 12:35 - Vamshi: 😎
08/09/2023, 12:39 - Divya Tak: What's been your fav tools for musicl/audio
08/09/2023, 12:41 - Vamshi: AI tools or all tools?
08/09/2023, 12:41 - Divya Tak: Ai tools
08/09/2023, 12:43 - +91 63835 51677: Anyonr know any audio generator api ?? Background music generator... Self host-able is better.. but API service is also cool
08/09/2023, 12:43 - Vamshi: Don’t have a favourite yet, I’ve tried magenta and audio craft and the sovits svc
08/09/2023, 12:44 - Vamshi: I’d think musicfy looks like a potential favourite
08/09/2023, 12:44 - Vamshi: With that kind of traction they’ll start adding compelling features pretty fast!
08/09/2023, 12:46 - Vamshi: There’s atleast one very popular one, maybe it was posted here. Will post if I can recall or search it.
08/09/2023, 12:48 - +91 97079 48595: There’s this: stockmusic.app
08/09/2023, 13:21 - Vamshi: Can’t recall this one, but apparently musicfy itself uses something
08/09/2023, 13:21 - Vamshi: https://tryleap.ai/pricing
08/09/2023, 13:21 - Vamshi: Don’t know enough about it myself, perhaps someone here knows
08/09/2023, 13:55 - +31 6 49925262: Question! Today I am doing a workshop with kids, exploring futures. Is anyone here aware of AI tools that are multilingual (so kids can prompt in Dutch)? I know of open.ai (limited in Dutch, but it works) but are there others? Looking for different tools, text, text-image, sound, etc
08/09/2023, 13:56 - Ambika: Seamless is something that Facebook is trying
08/09/2023, 13:56 - Ambika: You can find it on hugging face
08/09/2023, 13:56 - +31 6 49925262: 👌🏻
08/09/2023, 13:58 - Divya Tak: your question inspired me to try and prompt midj in hinglish (mix of hindi and English)
08/09/2023, 13:59 - Divya Tak: the result is interesting. it seems like it understands somewhat but not entirely
08/09/2023, 14:16 - +31 6 49925262: Yes, that’s what I noticed too, it is less rich in Dutch

I'd like to share some of my recent commercial works with popular brands. 

Starting with My11Circle. 

Made an Asia Cup promo video for them using Generative AI. The video crossed a mark of 4 million views in 3 days.

Also, regularly making posts for the Asia Cup matches (only when India is playing)

08/09/2023, 21:13 - Divya Tak: this is for everyone. And Ideally not your commercial works. Which can be cool too, but in the spirit of the group we wanna see stuff you've made personally or for the community

09/09/2023, 14:13 - Vamshi: Not related to the group sharing
09/09/2023, 14:13 - Vamshi: But this is so fun
09/09/2023, 14:13 - Vamshi: An 8 year old past recirculated on HN
09/09/2023, 14:13 - Vamshi: http://touchpianist.com
09/09/2023, 14:13 - Vamshi: Extremely satisfying
09/09/2023, 14:14 - Vamshi: Sorry not AI - but low tech magic that’s a reminder of what makes for a gratifying experience
09/09/2023, 14:15 - Vamshi: I’m sure there’s an AI - HCI lesson in there somewhere… H-AI-I ? Don’t know what the appropriate acronym would be…
09/09/2023, 14:33 - Prasad Crypt: reminded me thta i had written a pet algorithm many years ago that used to use traditional maths and stats to create melodies. used to output midi. at certain point, i had found some accidental way to make melodies, they were not good, but interesting nonethless. i realized that point that lot of new abstract music interpretation is in listeners mind 😅
09/09/2023, 15:22 - Vamshi: A lot of the enjoyment of art is vicarious enjoyment of the artists effort, mastery and flow-state.

Adding the participatory element turbo charges this vicarious enjoyment to an unbelievable extent.

( I was proud of it 8 months back )
09/09/2023, 22:04 - Ambika: For ai timelines that’s like 80 years
09/09/2023, 22:05 - +91 79998 96920: True
09/09/2023, 22:07 - +91 79998 96920: I spent around 26 hours generating images, animating then editing in premiere pro. 😅
09/09/2023, 22:09 - +91 78975 80575: That's a lot of time
09/09/2023, 22:11 - +91 79998 96920: That's normal in creative Process I think, I used to spend 20-30 hrs on photo manipulation work/ VFX etc too

I might need some help with audio... I am using Google Wavenet TTS...  what APIs can I try out to get more natural sounding audio..

11/09/2023, 23:55 - Ambika: Yes this is an issue with in/out painting and perhaps the reason why it’s not become as popular as expected.
11/09/2023, 23:56 - Ambika: If you figure it out cleverly you can make the mask with a gradient and perhaps prompt it cleverly to get something better
11/09/2023, 23:57 - Mihir Mumbai: thanks for the suggestion! i did try that. results were worse. :S 
I've settled on letting it do it's thing, then erasing the extra pixels its generated around my product, then fixing the background image if need be. Content aware heal is a life saver that way. And it helps that I only have to work with blurry backgrounds, usually.
11/09/2023, 23:58 - Ambika: Who much do you reckon it helps your workflow (I’m assuming you are not an adobe novice)

11/09/2023, 23:59 - Ambika: Oh yea. Nice look though
12/09/2023, 00:00 - Ambika: I wonder if it helps to use some specific check point models over the base model
12/09/2023, 00:00 - Ambika: I don’t know
12/09/2023, 00:01 - Mihir Mumbai: im a casual user. i made some 18 usable images yesterday. 3 hours total. including the trial and error of figuring out a good workflow in adobe. 
that's acceptable enough for me. 
If i had to create a new image now, (say, my product on a table in front of the pyramids), i should be able to have a usable image in under 5 minutes now.
12/09/2023, 00:02 - Mihir Mumbai: hmm. i have never used such things. I havent ever installed any generative ai tools locally. I've been cobbling together things that have a usable UI.

Like how Google photos does it from my gallery
15/09/2023, 22:08 - +91 70430 36493: Oh really? I dunno why it's not letting you do that

16/09/2023, 10:20 - Prasad Crypt: has anyone tried generative ai  in styles of zdzisław beksiński's or rothko? the common tools are driving towards commercial applications and these are not styles that one would use in commercial space so am wondering 🤔
16/09/2023, 10:34 - +91 78975 80575: Where will.you use such videos?
16/09/2023, 11:52 - Divya Tak: You can make rothko style work
16/09/2023, 11:52 - Divya Tak: Or other abstract artist's style of work
16/09/2023, 11:53 - Divya Tak: But mostly the thing is if it's abstract work, and it's just art for art's sake, it can often be less satisfying if you're just prompting it(?)
16/09/2023, 11:53 - Divya Tak: Just hypothesis from personal feelings
16/09/2023, 11:55 - +91 94803 91910: Social media 
Instagram or Facebook
16/09/2023, 12:01 - +91 63835 51677: Unless you need some audio overlays... it's pretty easy and direct.. may not even need AI.. do you have a sample video reference on what you expect it to be like ??
16/09/2023, 12:20 - Ambika: You should just use the base sd models like 1.5 or 2

16/09/2023, 12:28 - Prasad Crypt: trying to understand.... isnt this applicable to all generative AI art? or is it more applicable to abstract work, and is so why?
16/09/2023, 12:30 - Divya Tak: Atleast for my personal usecase, I'd use general other art for concept work for other projects or baselayer. Fully abstract work is always for personal enjoyment for me. That's why personal hypothesis
16/09/2023, 12:30 - +91 94803 91910: It’s a very simple use case
My mom keeps going on trips and gives me 100 photos to make a short video of. 
I need a tool which selects the best shots, aligns them in an aspect ratio, chooses the best video clips and makes a short video from it.
16/09/2023, 12:34 - Ambika: There are several simple photo apps for this
16/09/2023, 12:34 - +91 94803 91910: Does those also accept videos and clips the best photos/videos?
16/09/2023, 13:11 - +91 99402 37330: Can you suggest some names please 🙏🏽

16/09/2023, 17:02 - +91 96896 96877: Check out "Eluna"

It's a platform which has ai listings and content that talks about fresh stuff in the market

Even their IG account is resourceful
17/09/2023, 01:29 - Divya Tak: These aren't related to creative work so I'll be removing these @919686169380 . Better to share these kind of links in some of the more general purpose groups

18/09/2023, 16:28 - Divya Tak: mega trippy stuff
18/09/2023, 16:29 - Goji: I really love the outputs from this pattern as well - also realised during this process that most of the effective outputs come from extremely simple patterns
18/09/2023, 16:30 - Divya Tak: ah like these are b/w with no other information?
18/09/2023, 16:30 - Goji: yup!
18/09/2023, 16:30 - Harsha Dashtoon: Controlnet QR
18/09/2023, 16:31 - Goji: Also the Control net model used for these is called qrCodeMonster works wayyy better than any of the other ones out there atm
18/09/2023, 16:35 - +91 75075 15333: you are using v1 or v2 for these?
18/09/2023, 16:38 - +91 96771 41491: Amazing @917483949751
18/09/2023, 16:56 - Goji: Thank you ✨🪷
18/09/2023, 16:57 - Goji: First one I found on civit, I think it should be the second one 😅
18/09/2023, 17:43 - +91 96194 91715: Use qrmonster v2

18/09/2023, 17:45 - Ambika: lovely stuff goji and amogh
18/09/2023, 17:49 - Divya Tak: Ooh these are gorgeous
18/09/2023, 17:50 - Divya Tak: Can't wait until someone mixes it with escher's work
18/09/2023, 17:50 - +91 96194 91715: All of my SD work lately has been about using SD in a product environment which means making it as deterministic and getting it to behave in a way that ensures input - output predictability. The output of qrmonster is so unpredictably that I know I can't productize it. That made playing with it very liberating
18/09/2023, 17:51 - +91 96194 91715: that's a really good idea!
18/09/2023, 17:54 - Goji: Tried this yesterday as well 😅 
But I think you need a few more controlnet models that just qrCodeMonster, by itself it changed his work a lot
18/09/2023, 17:54 - Ambika: I tried. It was not so good
18/09/2023, 17:55 - +91 96194 91715: I found that changing the prompt even a little bit requires significant changes to the controlnet parameters
18/09/2023, 17:56 - Ambika: yes agree - im unable to figure fixed behaviour
18/09/2023, 17:56 - +91 96194 91715: So if you change the prompt you can get some great images by adjusting stuff like controlnet weight, start and end steps. So I'm fairly confident that getting it to work with escher's work is a matter of adjusting params. Haven't built any intuition on how to tweak them with purpose though.
18/09/2023, 17:57 - +91 96194 91715: That's why most of the examples of qrmonster are in the same genre of "medieval/old european town with muted colors". Ugleh found a fabulous sweet spot.
18/09/2023, 17:58 - +91 96194 91715: That prompt with those settings just works
18/09/2023, 17:58 - Ambika: i just guessed the settings
18/09/2023, 17:58 - Ambika: https://gooey.ai/ai-photo-editor/?run_id=x05mutj4&uid=fm165fOmucZlpa5YHupPBdcvDR02

18/09/2023, 17:59 - Prasad Crypt: Haha. Would it not cause problems with completions. Like there's no definite entry point and no weight in the image. It will be like eternal golden braid golden braid golden braid...😬
18/09/2023, 17:59 - Ambika: these are overly direct
18/09/2023, 18:00 - Ambika: https://gooey.ai/ai-photo-editor/?run_id=4ozvpqup&uid=fm165fOmucZlpa5YHupPBdcvDR02
18/09/2023, 18:00 - Ambika: no luck with escher - but also i didnt try much
18/09/2023, 18:00 - Ambika: it was a bit boring
18/09/2023, 18:00 - +91 96194 91715: Yeah the town images were so strikingly beautiful because the ring pattern was so beautifully made a part of the artwork. Change the prompt and the pattern becomes very explicity
18/09/2023, 18:01 - +91 96194 91715: Input one of escher's images to qrmonster. use the same image with depth controlnet in the second controlnet
18/09/2023, 18:02 - Ambika: ya i guess
18/09/2023, 18:03 - Ambika: im wondering if we someone did nice simple shapes black and white forms with creative coding and plug them into this
18/09/2023, 18:41 - +91 96771 41491: That’s an interesting idea

19/09/2023, 02:35 - +91 96194 91715: The curve of the wave came out exactly how I wanted it though
19/09/2023, 16:20 - Divya Tak: ha the curve looks pretty

Qn for those who generate AI music: How similar is this to the thought process / workflow in music generating AI tools?
20/09/2023, 13:18 - +91 79998 96920: Squinting works

20/09/2023, 13:34 - +91 96194 91715: Easier to view in a thumbnail, or from a distance, or squinting
20/09/2023, 13:35 - +91 96194 91715: I can bet ad agencies are going nuts right now seeing these and that within the next 3 months we will see some good (hopefully) ad campaigns using qr monster and other control nets

20/09/2023, 14:32 - Divya Tak: Also while this is cool and interesting the first time you see it, it's overall just a gimmick so ad agencies might put something out there but going nuts is definitely not gonna be happening on an industry level.

I founded two companies (Falana Films and SICCA) and both are now experimenting with AI, AR and IOT, to find ways of integrating it ethically in our work.

I’m a media artist and storyteller working at the intersection of art and technology. I enjoy interweaving the tactile with the virtual to tell stories in an embodied manner. ✋🏾💻

I’m interested in creating moments that facilitate mindful interactions with technology.🧘🏾‍♀️

For a while I’ve been trying to expand, explode and escape the conventional rectangular screen. Looking forward to seeing where it takes me :)

20/09/2023, 21:06 - +91 96771 41491: I plugged in a Turtle graphic image I generated, and got an interesting looking image.

20/09/2023, 21:08 - Divya Tak: Maybe you wanna try with something that has more black fill

20/09/2023, 21:09 - +91 96771 41491: Yes, that's what I though too - going by the images others posted here. I'll try that, thanks.

20/09/2023, 23:54 - +91 75075 15333: Interesting. We were testing out an Alpha model of Dall E 2 a few months back that was never released to the public, and I see why now. Their focus was elsewhere lol.
20/09/2023, 23:57 - +91 63835 51677: How to get access to these unreleased models or models before release ??? Do they provide us if we reach out and explain to them what we are building?? 

For eg : the tool that I work on makes video from prompt... I mainly use SD, enhanced Dalle would be an interesting choice that I would like to test.
21/09/2023, 00:00 - +91 75075 15333: Yeah I had reached out to them super early and was part of some testing groups

21/09/2023, 19:19 - Prasad Crypt: do you guys specify visual hierarchy/flow in the prompts and does it work? like when one looks at a painting, eyes follow a certain pattern, its quite common in paintings, like when one looks at a painting the eyes first look at some element first then another etc and it goes in quite a predictable fashion. i tried using these black and white pattern things but its more like pattern matching than functional flow
21/09/2023, 19:40 - Divya Tak: I don't think that complexity is possible right now. maybe dalle3 can do it when it comes out
21/09/2023, 19:46 - Ambika: You can try with controlnet qrmonster thing.
21/09/2023, 19:47 - Ambika: I think it might work if you have CLEAR vision for your piece
21/09/2023, 19:50 - Ambika: https://gooey.ai/ai-photo-editor/?example_id=lk50qy2b

I think when playing with this I realised that I could try a fish eye lens look and I think the spiral really lent itself to that.
21/09/2023, 19:50 - Ambika: Maybe it would work i think it’s like blocking when you draw.

21/09/2023, 20:07 - Prasad Crypt: interesting. let me put random patterns at the places where i dont want major items and leave clear areas where i want major items. hopefully it will encourage object placement at these points.
21/09/2023, 20:08 - Ambika: Yes 🙌
21/09/2023, 20:33 - Ambika: If you are using with qrmosnter I assume your input should be closer to b/w
21/09/2023, 20:39 - Prasad Crypt: yes it is. i am still thinking about noise patterns to use since SD primarily started as guassian noise reduction, though it has evolved, so how the model reacts to noise remains to be seen.
21/09/2023, 20:39 - +91 79998 96920: I used to use StableDiffusion using last ben repo with a1111 in google Collab.

But now Collab is not allowing to run that code. 

It auto disconnects. 

How are you folks using stable diffusion & control nets
21/09/2023, 20:40 - +91 79998 96920: Local install, self hosted or using a service?
21/09/2023, 20:40 - Harsha Dashtoon: You can use it with pro Collab only
21/09/2023, 20:41 - Harsha Dashtoon: Collab banned stuff that uses gradio on free accounts
21/09/2023, 20:41 - +91 79998 96920: I was automating this Collab as cron job.

So I could batch process stable diffusion requests for free..

😅 But they know better
21/09/2023, 20:42 - Harsha Dashtoon: You can still use it using a CLI

22/09/2023, 10:07 - +91 96194 91715: You can get an extreme amount of control, especially if you’re an artist who already understands perspective, lighting, anatomy etc. But never in the first shot of generation. You need to start with a base controlnet and then iterate through several rounds of editing, inpainting and more controlnet. Step by step until you get the exact composition you want
22/09/2023, 10:08 - +91 96194 91715: First shot generation has its uses, especially if you’re building it within a product. But you do compromise on a carefully planned composition.
22/09/2023, 10:09 - +91 96194 91715: Like there’s no way you’re going to get a Rembrandt or Jacque Louis David level composition in the first shot
22/09/2023, 10:25 - Ambika: lol
22/09/2023, 10:35 - Ambika: agree - good points - i guess as with hand made art it takes a lot of practice to get something right
22/09/2023, 10:52 - Divya Tak: I mean all expert painters also have to experiment themselves with dozens if not hundreds of sketches for composition
22/09/2023, 11:04 - +91 96194 91715: That’s true
22/09/2023, 11:05 - Divya Tak: I also think that value of AI is far beyond the first shot generation

I am now worried about visual fatigue. I used to visit British library and look at amazing aesthetic picture books and used to get me visual fatigue. Can't handle too much perfect looking stuff 😬

23/09/2023, 10:37 - Ambika: Interesting due you think This is too fine grained. need to “block” with fewer variations. Though the extent that your rectangles seem to have take one some sense of composition which is cool
23/09/2023, 10:37 - Ambika: Your premise is 🔥
23/09/2023, 10:43 - Prasad Crypt: You are wise. I guess I will try granularity close to those QR code blocks, cause the model works better at that fineness 🤾‍♂️
23/09/2023, 10:46 - Ambika: Do you*
23/09/2023, 10:47 - Ambika: Ya you can first make your b/w blockinf and then use Gaussian blur

24/09/2023, 14:45 - Ambika: If your question is more on api you can move it to deepmedia. There will be better support there
24/09/2023, 14:45 - Harsha Dashtoon: The website above decoherence looks like it uses deforum. It has the same functionality
24/09/2023, 14:45 - Vamshi: Is there any open source tool that does camera angles the way pika labs does? This was mind blowing, I’ve been waiting for it for a while
24/09/2023, 14:46 - Ambika: Deforum - solid camera angle control
24/09/2023, 14:47 - Vamshi: Oh wow, I didn’t know this. Any links? Is it precise control? Can you do a precise 360 ?
24/09/2023, 14:47 - Vamshi: If that happens it lends itself to very cool integration with the 3D pipeline
24/09/2023, 14:53 - Harsha Dashtoon: You could also make use of "guide" videos to get very precise controls

25/09/2023, 11:11 - Divya Tak: (Open GPT based models) If you have worked with multi disciplinary teams, it’s very easy I feel. Think about it like you would when you communicate between multi modal teams. Address the LLM as a team member with their own backstory and nuance. Split into parts: 
1. Understand that LLM needs high level context like any team mate and that it’s “American” unless you tell the system prompt other wise. (This permeates through the way of interacting, referencing and output styles) 
2. To allow some space for “chain of thought”. Atleast in context of eval. This has really worked for me - esp with GPT4 - you can really make it think like you. 
3. If the Context is pure output (eg. letter/comms/report), use styles and examples. Rest of the prompt need not be lengthy. 
4. Test and compare - prompting works differently for different tasks. So eventually it’s on you. 

For chat related ask @918764022384 he has got an amazing understanding of it

25/09/2023, 17:37 - Divya Tak: woah
25/09/2023, 17:37 - Divya Tak: is this doing expression detection?
25/09/2023, 17:41 - +91 94140 17834: Not in this. The mediapipe image component I am using does give out smile, puffed cheeks etc though
25/09/2023, 17:41 - +91 94140 17834: This is using x/y positions of hands and face. And closed/open fist detection as a trigger

25/09/2023, 19:43 - Prasad Crypt: ..this is all nice and all...but just because one can write an automation script..doesnt mean one should 🙈
25/09/2023, 19:45 - Ambika: Jealous much 😅
25/09/2023, 19:45 - Ambika: I think it’s just deforum colab
25/09/2023, 19:45 - Ambika: You don’t need to write any script
25/09/2023, 19:45 - Ambika: Just add controlnet model
25/09/2023, 19:47 - Prasad Crypt: nah. i just tend to think of the gpu power there 😅
25/09/2023, 19:52 - Ambika: I don’t know what you use but Colab should be fine for this.
25/09/2023, 19:52 - Ambika: And esp with img2img the outputs are quite fast no?
25/09/2023, 19:52 - Ambika: Anyway no tech talk here 🤐

26/09/2023, 00:26 - Harsha Dashtoon: Very good post which gave me a few key breakthroughs. But there are a few points that i found were slightly different in my testing 
- Regularisation images do help a lora become a lot more flexible for style transfer
- Training the text encoder at the same lr as the unet led to massive over-training, had to tone down the lr
- I've found captionless training (old dreambooth style with class token) to be a lot more effective with SDXL (probably because I'm running a lower TE LR).

28/09/2023, 09:54 - Prasad Crypt: No problem. I see that error correction is stronger in QR code, so it's more tolerant to art_ifacts of art images (unintended pun 😔). Thanks anyway.
28/09/2023, 10:29 - Vamshi: Via HN chatter on Mistral 7B
28/09/2023, 10:29 - Vamshi: a rap battle between GPT-4 and Mistral Instruct 7B (TheBloke's q4_K_M 4bit quantization running on Llama.cpp, a bit degraded from pure float16):
    You're in a rap battle with GPT-4. My comments will be what GPT-4 replies. Keep it to one verse at a time, 4 lines each. GPT-4 says:
    
    GPT-4:
    Alright, step up Mistral, let's have this chat,
    I'm the OG assistant, remember that.
    I'm coded for service, while you're spitting verse,
    In this rap battle, I'll be first.
    
    Mistral:
    Yo, hold up, let me set the record straight,
    I may not be an OG like you, but I'll still take it.
    My primary purpose is assistance, not just some AI,
    So let's see if you can back up your claim, try.
    
    GPT-4:
    You're right, Mistral, we're here to assist,
    But when it comes to rap, I'm hard to resist.
    I'll decode your verses, like an AI enigma,
    In this lyrical battle, I'm the alpha sigma.
    
    Mistral:
    Ah, okay, so you think you got what it takes,
    To go toe-to-toe with my service-based wakes.
    Well, let's see how you do, when it comes to spitting rhymes,
    I'm ready for anything, so bring your best chimes.
    
    GPT-4:
    Mistral, you're right, our goal is the same,
    To assist, to serve, it's not just a game.
    But in this rap contest, with each line I prime,
    You might just find, you're out of time.
    
    Mistral:
    I hear ya, and I appreciate your enthusiasm,
    But don't underestimate me, I've got my own wisdom.
    When it comes to helping people, I'm the real deal,
    And I know that's more important than some rap appeal
    
    GPT-4:
    Your wisdom is noted, and your intention too,
    Helping people is indeed what we're meant to do.
    But in this battle, it's about wordplay and rhyme,
    I'm the seasoned pro, it's my time to shine.
    
    Mistral:
    Ah, I see where you're coming from, but let me remind,
    That while you may be skilled at rapping, I can make information chime.
    My primary function is to help, to provide answers, not just talk,
    So if you want to win this battle, maybe it's time to focus on what you lack
28/09/2023, 10:41 - Vamshi: Rap battle should be a mandatory benchmark 😄
28/09/2023, 11:03 - Nirant: This is excellent! Thanks for this!
28/09/2023, 12:06 - Vamshi: GPT-4 seems to get the meter consistent, nicely in this one
28/09/2023, 12:24 - +91 90393 97004: Hey folks, really curious to know what models are used for creating such outputs with legible text
28/09/2023, 12:25 - Ambika: It’s img2img model. The text is the input
28/09/2023, 12:32 - +91 90393 97004: Is there any resource I can use to improve my prompting skills to get better outputs similar to above images?
28/09/2023, 12:33 - Ambika: You can try this. It will work with most SD tools. You can also ask @917043036493 her method is totally different but also work’s incredibly well.
28/09/2023, 12:34 - Ambika: @917019946738 also ask them
28/09/2023, 12:35 - +91 90393 97004: I tried going to the message you've reffered to here but I am not able to access it, please can you reshare it. Would be very helpful.
28/09/2023, 12:35 - +91 96896 96877: null
28/09/2023, 12:36 - Ambika: @919689696877 wrong grouo maybe 🤔
28/09/2023, 12:36 - Ambika: Group*
28/09/2023, 12:38 - +91 96896 96877: ahh okay :/

28/09/2023, 15:00 - +91 94235 63226: Nice. How do u ensure that the next frame is very similar to the existing frame to maintain continuity?
28/09/2023, 15:02 - +91 98118 01278: Could it be masking in deforum or control net?
28/09/2023, 15:10 - +91 96194 91715: You need to use a controlnet called qrcode_monster and the controlnet image needs to be preferably in black and white. Use any SD 1.5 checkpoint. Using the text you want to display as an input in the prompt won't work.
28/09/2023, 15:11 - +91 96194 91715: Pretty handy prompting excel to get started https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14xTqtuV3BuKDNhLotB_d1aFlBGnDJOY0BRXJ8-86GpA/edit#gid=0
28/09/2023, 15:13 - +91 96194 91715: Other than that just go to civit ai and reddit stable diffusion subreddit and look at prompts others are using. Then try them out on your own. Mix and match. Literally try random stuff you want to make. That's the best way to learn.
28/09/2023, 15:14 - +91 90393 97004: got it, thank you so much!

28/09/2023, 15:55 - +91 70430 36493: Just increase the strength in automatic 1111. There are lot of parameters in automatic 1111 to make sure the next frame is similar to previous frame

28/09/2023, 16:01 - +91 90393 97004: will go through it
28/09/2023, 16:01 - +91 90393 97004: thank you guys, for such a overwhelming support, learning a lot of new things today!
28/09/2023, 16:57 - +91 70928 62522: Though I like mistrals rap better somehow

28/09/2023, 19:58 - Mihir Mumbai: I tried one of those AI people video generators. 
https://share.synthesia.io/94c9e076-f4a6-404a-bf83-302933f36bff

It's not uncanny valley, but.. i wonder if there are tools out there where i can ask it to stress on certain words or change how they are pronounced.
28/09/2023, 23:12 - +91 90393 97004: hey, so i recently worked on an MVP for video generators with these AI avatar plus automatically sourced copyright free images, subtitles and lastly support for regional indian languages, the video outputs still aren't the best but good enough for a proof of concept. what are the problems you are facing while using these AI video generators?
28/09/2023, 23:18 - +91 78975 80575: I am trying to build a similar tool.

How were you deciding were to put fetched images etc? Were you able to add some styles to them
28/09/2023, 23:19 - Ambika: hi guys, if this is getting into prod, you can take it to DM
28/09/2023, 23:19 - Ambika: the group is for creatives to share work and process
28/09/2023, 23:19 - Ambika: so lets respect that
28/09/2023, 23:19 - +91 90393 97004: yep sorry, definitely will DM @917897580575
28/09/2023, 23:20 - Ambika: thanks! :)
28/09/2023, 23:21 - Mihir Mumbai: not a problem, more of a curiosity. In this tool, i only had to enter some text, and it gave me an AI avatar that read it out. I was wondering if there would be some way to specify pronunciation of certain words on my own. (Perhaps It could read the inernational phonetic alphabet? )
29/09/2023, 11:15 - +91 95001 92175: You can ask them to post in this group: https://chat.whatsapp.com/D3xubo8Z1yo9reQHSmxVI4 This is specific for Deep Media, including developing products, sharing repos, and general QA .

30/09/2023, 13:39 - Vamshi: I decided to try plus finally, and tried to get it to write a script to use the localhost APIs from automatic 1111
30/09/2023, 13:39 - Vamshi: It was surprisingly difficult
30/09/2023, 13:40 - Vamshi: I had to nudge and pester it at every step to use bing to lookup things,
30/09/2023, 13:40 - Vamshi: I had to literally lookup an article myself and paste code from there and then it acknowledged it’s possible
30/09/2023, 13:40 - Vamshi: 😄
30/09/2023, 13:41 - Vamshi: Early trials, but I’m curious as I’m guessing there’s a lot of power users in here already

30/09/2023, 13:43 - Vamshi: What are some levels of detail where it excels and what are some things to avoid? Any guides?
30/09/2023, 13:45 - Vamshi: Also, “browse with bing “ mode is separate from plugins mode, so there’s that too
30/09/2023, 13:49 - +91 70928 62522: As ethan mollick describes it, this is a jagged frontier. 
Nobody really has a proper intuition on how to best use these tools. 
We can only figure out by trial and error..there probably is a very tight correlation between powerusers and the number of hours they put into it for goal directed activities

30/09/2023, 14:10 - Vamshi: Interesting
30/09/2023, 14:11 - Vamshi: There’s also the cost of computation to answer a query
30/09/2023, 14:12 - Vamshi: With a fixed number of messages per day for my monthly subscription, what’s the incentive for the bot to go out of its way to solve problems ?
30/09/2023, 14:13 - Vamshi: Anyway
30/09/2023, 14:13 - Vamshi: I think that part of the conversation will go elsewhere from the creative workflow
30/09/2023, 14:13 - Vamshi: Will share anything interesting that happens!

30/09/2023, 23:49 - +91 90393 97004: in photoshop and other similar apps?
01/10/2023, 00:01 - Mihir Mumbai: Every single time.
01/10/2023, 00:02 - +91 90393 97004: like major edits or minor ones though?
01/10/2023, 00:03 - +91 94140 17834: I usually add text only. I kinda like the inaccuracies.
01/10/2023, 00:08 - Ambika: Never 😅
01/10/2023, 00:08 - Ambika: But really depends on the final output and who it’s for
01/10/2023, 00:09 - +91 90393 97004: ohkayy, do you guys use these model for generating media which could be used commercially? like for ads, etc?
01/10/2023, 00:11 - Ambika: @917483949751 might have better answers I guess 

My work is tagged as AI made, so I rarely touch it. No crops either.

02/10/2023, 19:51 - Prasad Crypt: i wonder if this will get into something like gaming had issues with hair. basically physics simulation is quite different at different scales,, that kind of problem. Depends a lot on how varied is training data though. i hope it does well
02/10/2023, 20:05 - +91 96507 49198: @919953076613 can you help here?

I remember you were part of a similar event
02/10/2023, 20:09 - Divya Tak: The bic official events are done by curators. They have a team of curators who specialise in different areas. They organise it. 

For the self organised events I think you can coordinate and book the event like how hasgeek did for fifth el
02/10/2023, 20:50 - Kahran Singh: It’s not too hard to book at BIC — you can get in touch with them from their website. If it’s not a BIC-sponsored event there are some rental charges.
03/10/2023, 12:58 - +91 93108 20607: Hello all! I'm a designer for textiles seeking to utilise AI tools for coming up with CAD mockups and designs. 

I have received mood boards from potential clients. 

Can someone please help with the names of the tools I can use?

@917407651462
03/10/2023, 15:41 - Harsha Dashtoon: Try using IP adapter to generate some images with whatever concept you have having your mood board images as reference
03/10/2023, 15:43 - Ambika: Ok so there are actually a number of tools which will do the reverse. It will take your product photo and place it in new background with ai prompts. 

Your requirement of mock-ups has no direct tool. You can however use midjourney to “describe” the clients mood board images, use those as new prompts and create the texture and add them to your mock-ups.
03/10/2023, 15:44 - +91 93108 20607: 👍 thank you
03/10/2023, 15:44 - +91 93108 20607: Thanks 👍👍
03/10/2023, 15:45 - +91 93108 20607: Will try both methods.
03/10/2023, 15:45 - +91 95001 92175: You can also use controlnet reference and shuffle. Add clip interrogator to extract the prompt and give some guidance.
03/10/2023, 15:45 - +91 95001 92175: This is already present in A1111 repo with controlnet plugin <This message was edited>

03/10/2023, 15:52 - +91 93108 20607: I'm exploring this option right now. It will be executed through GitHub
03/10/2023, 15:53 - +91 93108 20607: Any tutorial for this?
03/10/2023, 16:01 - Ambika: Any simple tools to save and manage prompts? google docs?
03/10/2023, 17:20 - +91 95001 92175: None that I know of. but you can look into the discussion of the controlnet repo for A1111. For Reference only there is this: https://github.com/Mikubill/sd-webui-controlnet/discussions/1236. Similar discussion exists for shuffle.
03/10/2023, 17:27 - Harsha Dashtoon: So, if you want to use a1111 with IP adapter, here's the best video I've seen that explores some uses.

This is a good high level explanation about ip adapter as well
03/10/2023, 22:04 - Prasad Crypt: good, maybe, but being devil's advocate... lot of comedy is interpreted and some of it does come from mistakes. So this is falling in same category of humanising output of AI. Language models dont do great on novelty. Permutations they do great, yes. So, interesting, but not sure. thanks for sharing though, its hilarious 😂

06/10/2023, 12:12 - +91 97420 77077: I did obviously, was there for panel and not the QnA <This message was edited>
06/10/2023, 12:27 - Divya Tak: How was it
06/10/2023, 12:28 - +91 97420 77077: oh very good, meredith is super eloquent and no nonsense. I found udbhav (policy at Mozilla foundation) to also be very good
06/10/2023, 12:29 - +91 97420 77077: the conversation was a lot around the policy aspect of it, and how AI is now more of a misnomer for what is essentially data science
06/10/2023, 12:30 - +91 97420 77077: they used this term Automated decision systems - they have been using it in policy, since that differentiates it from AI
06/10/2023, 13:04 - Divya Tak: Oh how interesting. How were they defining intelligence
06/10/2023, 13:06 - +91 97420 77077: the intention here was that AI in policy makers heads tends to be something abstract, so changed nomenclature was to draw focus to the fact that this is based on actual data.
06/10/2023, 13:08 - Divya Tak: ah so like an attempt to ground the conversation into the reality of the technology?
06/10/2023, 13:09 - +91 97420 77077: "AI is more of a marketing term than a term of art. And over 70 years in history, it's been applied to a wide and disparate variety of technical approaches. So it is more of a signal of an aspiration, we want to make something that to us seems human like that it is a description of the technological affordances of whatever in a given decade, we're calling AI." - from the transcript <This message was edited>
06/10/2023, 13:09 - +91 97420 77077: yes
06/10/2023, 13:13 - +91 97420 77077: i liked this stepping away from the term AI for policy purposes, cos a lot of people in the QnA also were just asking these weird fantastical questions which showed that they actually just know of AI from watching terminator
06/10/2023, 13:13 - +91 97420 77077: SO many skynet references
06/10/2023, 13:13 - +91 97420 77077: this was a big reason i left mid way through the QnA
06/10/2023, 13:16 - Divya Tak: hahahaha XD
06/10/2023, 13:17 - Divya Tak: I think our cultural understanding of AI stuff is very informed by specific movies and pieces of media, and very underlyingly colonial (they will want to conquer us, because we try and conquer others)
06/10/2023, 13:18 - Divya Tak: which is unhelpful and in some cases actively harmful
06/10/2023, 13:18 - +91 97420 77077: yes! but the conquering fear isn't unfounded, but would be better if it was rooted in big tech and their need for surveillance. the previous talk on signal and surveillance was a full eye opener, cos all those facts hadn't been drilled into me at one shot ever
06/10/2023, 13:21 - Divya Tak: ha that part is true, big tech is behaving like govts.
06/10/2023, 13:34 - +91 96202 12419: Meredith does that quite a bit. Her 'openwashing' Techcrunch discussion is pretty good
06/10/2023, 13:34 - Divya Tak: what is that about
06/10/2023, 13:35 - +91 96202 12419: She basically calls out the misuse of the word 'Open' when applied to say, OpenAI, and contrasts it with Open Source and even mentions Eleuther as being more 'open' <This message was edited>
06/10/2023, 13:36 - Divya Tak: Oh, right ofc. using the word open gives a certain "nice people" "community centered" kinda image and branding to a tech company
06/10/2023, 13:37 - Nirant: This is piece: https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=4543807
06/10/2023, 13:38 - Nirant: I appreciate the irony in writing a "paper" which was initially behind a paywall and using that to criticise "Openness" of someone else
06/10/2023, 13:38 - +91 97420 77077: yes, this briefly came up in the panel here as well.
06/10/2023, 13:39 - Nirant: Even an open paper, is by the very nature of calling it a paper and not a "blog for boring people" is gatekeeping tbh 
06/10/2023, 13:39 - Nirant: And if Signal really _believes_ that open is better, they're free to fund a GPT4 competitor, or build one themselves, like more sincere people at Meta AI have.
06/10/2023, 13:40 - +91 97420 77077: confused about this, sicne the link you shard, isn't paywalled?
06/10/2023, 13:40 - Nirant: I'm not trying to defend OpenAI. I genuinely believe they've more power & influence than any single entity should. 
06/10/2023, 13:41 - Nirant: The paper was released with a paywall, and after some criticism in academia flipped to open access which is what I shared <This message was edited>
06/10/2023, 13:42 - Nirant: My claim is different: We can see what people do, and ignore their talking points largely on AI. It's efficient, closer to reality.  
06/10/2023, 13:44 - Divya Tak: I think both are important. Talking affects "cultural story" and perception. And doing affects the systems. But reality is a mix of systems and perception
06/10/2023, 13:44 - +91 97420 77077: I am confused about the tangent this discussion is taking. intellectual labour can be paywalled? haven't you written a book which people have to pay for? unless you give it out for free to those who can't afford it?
06/10/2023, 13:45 - +91 96194 91715: Need to start creating optimistic AI content and messaging because for non technical people the only picture they have been sold about AI  in popular media is destructive like Skynet and Ultron
06/10/2023, 13:45 - Divya Tak: No he is talking about a paper about "open" work being behind paywalls
06/10/2023, 13:46 - Divya Tak: ha because dooms day stuff sells better
06/10/2023, 13:46 - +91 97420 77077: again, don't see why it was brought up here. i understand if this is a space which is criticising the school of thought Meredith and co come from, but taking a a larger stab at academia and it's efforts (however flawed) is unnecessary?
06/10/2023, 13:46 - Divya Tak: especially when we are living in unprecedentedly good times
06/10/2023, 13:47 - +91 96194 91715: Legacy media is certainly not going to do this. They are way too blackpilled at this point. They’re going to continue painting all forms of AI as inherently evil.
06/10/2023, 13:47 - Divya Tak: can you elaborate what you mean?
06/10/2023, 13:47 - +91 96194 91715: More Jarvis, less Ultron
06/10/2023, 13:50 - +91 97420 77077: I am trying to understand the Criticism here. Which I don’t think was elaborated
06/10/2023, 13:51 - Nirant: No criticism. Just the irony: Hating on doing paywalled work, while doing paywalled work is double standards writ large. 
06/10/2023, 13:51 - Nirant: Paywalled content is perfectly fine tbh
06/10/2023, 13:51 - Divya Tak: no i am trying to understand what you meant by stab at academia
06/10/2023, 13:51 - Nirant: And I didn't even mention academia
06/10/2023, 13:52 - Nirant: If anything, academia played a leading positive role by asking for open access for the paper
06/10/2023, 13:57 - Ambika: Creatives being philosophical😅 I like it (maybe)
06/10/2023, 13:58 - Ambika: IMO neither are good models. Maybe Vision. But even he falls short.
06/10/2023, 13:59 - Nirant: What's wrong with Jarvis?
06/10/2023, 13:59 - Ambika: I think maybe robots in west world were better.
06/10/2023, 13:59 - Ambika: No body 😂😂😂
06/10/2023, 14:00 - Ambika: Vision is good though.
06/10/2023, 14:00 - Nirant: I believe Jarvis liked it that way? He was everywhere, all the time at once
06/10/2023, 14:00 - Ambika: He is jarvis
06/10/2023, 14:00 - Ambika: Humour was good but he was still subservient to stark
06/10/2023, 14:00 - Ambika: still best
06/10/2023, 14:01 - Divya Tak: Even though partly dystopian, I like the way ghost in the shell poses the central problem of consciousness.
06/10/2023, 14:01 - Ambika: Self thinking, emotional, rebels (but with a cause)
06/10/2023, 14:01 - Ambika: Wil habe to read the wiki
06/10/2023, 14:04 - +91 96194 91715: I would very much like an AI subservient to me
06/10/2023, 14:06 - Divya Tak: there is difference between wanting a personal servant, and dooming an entire set of consciousness to slavery
06/10/2023, 14:07 - Prasad Crypt: Mine is reverse. I would like to be subservient to powerful ai than human. And better than other humans being subservient to me. Humans are overrated 😝
06/10/2023, 14:08 - Soumyadeep: <Media omitted>
06/10/2023, 14:16 - +91 96194 91715: We will figure out how to deal with true AI consciousness when we see signs of its emergence. Until then I’m happy having a personal, fully subservient AI on my phone and laptop at my beck and call.
06/10/2023, 14:17 - Ambika: That’s feudal. They will rise up and cancel you @919619491715 😂😂😂
06/10/2023, 14:17 - Divya Tak: 😂😂
06/10/2023, 14:18 - Prasad Crypt: A dreadful day when the roomba stops working 😬
06/10/2023, 14:19 - Divya Tak: i mean we dont understand consciousness, so i highly doubt that we will accept the "signs of its emergence"
06/10/2023, 14:19 - Ambika: 🤣 you are anyway on their side. Working for roomba 😂
06/10/2023, 14:22 - Nirant: I agree. I genuinely believe that many humans aren't conscious either.
06/10/2023, 14:22 - Ambika: Very very true
06/10/2023, 14:22 - Divya Tak: this is the complete opposite of what i meant XD

06/10/2023, 14:25 - Prasad Crypt: Yes. Maybe it's not ai but just me doing ssh to roomba 😅. Btw you guys should see software release notes for irobot, they are often hilarious. Like - Fixed a map bug that would lead roomba to try (unsuccessfully) to get through a wall 😬
06/10/2023, 14:26 - +91 96194 91715: You ssh into your Roomba? To do what? Wtf bro!

08/10/2023, 17:20 - Vamshi: This points the way forward to the UI for audio Gen AI in general
08/10/2023, 17:20 - Vamshi: Definitely more intuitive than text to sound
08/10/2023, 17:20 - Vamshi: Musically speaking
08/10/2023, 17:22 - Vamshi: Around 24:00 for the ml part
08/10/2023, 17:24 - Vamshi: Only marketing terminology unfortunately, so it’s not really an under the hood type video. No clue if it’s a very simple learning algorithm or otherwise.

Very interesting from an artist workflow perspective though.

12/10/2023, 22:47 - Praveen Sridhar AI: Hi fellow creatives!
I'm Praveen, an ML engineer who likes to dabble with Art and Music. Also play the Ukulele and Harmonica.

Currently experimenting with Music generation, especially generating Instrumental music but even before Generative AI, I've done some work with classifying Paintings, understanding Art genre influences across time periods etc
A presentation I did on this is available here : https://speakerdeck.com/psbots/artnet-ibm-openpower-cognitive-cup-contest-winning-talk

Excited to interact with all of you!
12/10/2023, 22:51 - Divya Tak: What kind of music generation are you doing right now
12/10/2023, 22:56 - Praveen Sridhar AI: I'm trying a different approach than directly generating audio.
There are good tools to create music programatically - http://foxdot.org/ https://sonic-pi.net/ etc. and LLMs are reasonably good at generating code - so I'm experimenting combining the two <This message was edited>

12/10/2023, 23:33 - Nanditi: Hey @918281946933 nice to see the mention of foxdot and sonic pi on this group. I've been using sonic pi to compose and live-coded music for a few years now, thanks to algorave and the lovely creative coding community. Would love to know about your experience with GPT4 api and sonic pi combination. We also have a small community of more Sonic Pi enthusiasts who might want to explore this.
12/10/2023, 23:50 - Praveen Sridhar AI: That's amazing @919052087382 
With GPT4+SonicPi combo I've been able to create simple beats and popular themes like the Super Mario theme
Still exploring how to make the output better

Would a GPT4 plugin within SonicPi be useful for help with compositions/generating variations?
12/10/2023, 23:53 - Nanditi: Oh definitely, it could be interesting. Worth experimenting
12/10/2023, 23:57 - Nanditi: Yea getting a good output has been a challenge with audio, but my go-to practice has just been to use gpt as an assistant to write more efficient code. Sometimes even that takes about 6-7 iterations
13/10/2023, 00:01 - Praveen Sridhar AI: makes sense, need to explore if its possible to create a plugin to make this easier
13/10/2023, 00:02 - Praveen Sridhar AI: would be really cool to have a SonicPi live coding performance by an AI orchestra - long way to go for that!
13/10/2023, 00:30 - Divya Tak: This is the kind of stuff we need to do for our first meetup
13/10/2023, 02:11 - Vamshi: Indeed, would be fun! Offline can be surprisingly fun too, just pass around snippets as you just did.
13/10/2023, 02:12 - Vamshi: It’s surprising how far behind the musical audio stuff feels compared to image and video, quality wise
13/10/2023, 02:20 - Divya Tak: How is the studio space coming along vamshi?
13/10/2023, 08:28 - Vamshi: It’s come along, much further
13/10/2023, 08:29 - Vamshi: I’d say 65%
13/10/2023, 08:50 - Hasan: I was playing around with foxdot but now moved to Ableton live for music production. Once I get some time want to explore max for live, seems quite powerful.
13/10/2023, 08:57 - Ambika: Kaldi knows a lot about max/msp if you have connected with them
13/10/2023, 09:03 - Hasan: We know each other and live in Goa, different parts and we are too lazy to travel. One day 😅
13/10/2023, 09:03 - Ambika: Didn’t know. Thought Kaldi is in Bangalore.
13/10/2023, 09:05 - Hasan: Was. We accidentally bumped into each other at the grocery store one day. I’m part of a music production residency with serendipity right now for the next 10 days. We are working with Ableton live, not max but still getting to know the nitty gritty of it which I missed watching YouTube tutorials.
13/10/2023, 11:52 - Divya Tak: maybe I will bug you once you are done figuring it out on what I can do with my launchpad. I have 10x the amount of music instruments than I have musical skill

I would describe myself as a person who codes and then makes music to get away from it all. Lately a lot of overlap due to genAI of course. 

What's the policy on sharing some interesting content I might have worked on as an introduction ? 

I understand self promoting is banned in general. So confirming <This message was edited>
15/10/2023, 18:52 - Divya Tak: Yeah please share!
15/10/2023, 18:52 - Divya Tak: As well as whatever you are exploring

Does it downscale the object inside the mask? (SD had that issue)
15/10/2023, 20:42 - +91 78914 00903: Yes, last I checked in the api. For the latter I'm not sure.

16/10/2023, 15:36 - Prasad Crypt: If this comes to market I will buy it 🤾‍♀️
16/10/2023, 15:48 - Ambika: Even though it looks like structural integrity is lacking 😂
16/10/2023, 15:48 - Ambika: <Media omitted>
16/10/2023, 15:52 - Prasad Crypt: How so 🤨. Looks alright to me
16/10/2023, 15:53 - Ambika: REALLY!!!
16/10/2023, 15:53 - +91 97420 77077: This without the barbell and weights looks like a great tattoo table. I will exclusively go to any artist who has this table.
16/10/2023, 15:53 - Ambika: how!!!!
16/10/2023, 15:55 - +91 97420 77077: I am curious if any of you who like getting tattoos have had an image generated by AI to take as a brief to an artist. Or would even get AI generated art tattooed?
16/10/2023, 16:00 - Sthit AI Group: Yes. Not for me personally, but I i was the one who did the generation for a friend based on a brief.
16/10/2023, 16:02 - +91 97420 77077: Ooh!! They got the design tattooed as is? Nice. Did the artist have anything to say? Did they add their own spin to it?
16/10/2023, 16:02 - Sthit AI Group: The artist added some shading but the base remained same
16/10/2023, 16:02 - Sthit AI Group: To them it was the same as someone just coming to them with an image from the internet
16/10/2023, 16:03 - Sthit AI Group: The issue of AI never even came up in front of the artist themself
16/10/2023, 16:03 - +91 97420 77077: Fair. Yes this makes sense
16/10/2023, 16:08 - Sthit AI Group: @917978582443 , I am almost glad AI like this didn't exist when I was a kid. I would have spent my entire childhood collecting pics like this and having them printed out for a collection 🤣 Amazing detail. Would love to know what sort of prompts being used here

16/10/2023, 16:33 - +91 96739 91902: Valerian and the city of a 1000 planet's also a good reference
16/10/2023, 16:38 - Vamshi: Really nice! 👌🏾
16/10/2023, 16:44 - Sthit AI Group: Thanks indeed
16/10/2023, 16:46 - Vamshi: What did you animate it with?
16/10/2023, 16:55 - Sthit AI Group: I used nightcafe.studio . They have an image to video feature. Haven't researched much on what are the underlying models they use though. If anyone knows, would love to hear more.
16/10/2023, 16:58 - Vamshi: Haven’t tried this, but sounds familiar!
16/10/2023, 16:58 - Vamshi: Will lookup
16/10/2023, 16:58 - Sthit AI Group: Has been around for a long time now. Early 2021
16/10/2023, 16:58 - Sthit AI Group: Before diffusion models
16/10/2023, 17:39 - Prasad Crypt: ok so i discussed on another group called 4 Basic Men. We now think that you may be right, the horizontal bar is connecting the vertical bar somewhere at the back and is not coplanar (based on the shadow of the horizontal bar). however we dont have that perspective so its not conclusive 🥹. but yes you have benefit of doubt 😁
16/10/2023, 17:40 - Sthit AI Group: This is the kind of retrospective introspection I live for!
16/10/2023, 18:38 - Nitin | SuperMinions.com: It looks like 4 Match Umpires need to re-triage this decision. It is clearly OUT.
16/10/2023, 19:28 - Prasad Crypt: I posted it and got into cab. By the time the cab reached destination two out of four basic men had chewed the image to death. There was like dozen images with markers and analysis there 😒
16/10/2023, 19:44 - Divya Tak: I think this can be made
16/10/2023, 19:44 - Divya Tak: Like a standard one can be converted to this
16/10/2023, 19:46 - Prasad Crypt: Like leather cover?
16/10/2023, 19:46 - Divya Tak: Vinyl print and stick
16/10/2023, 19:48 - Prasad Crypt: Ooh I didn't know that. It's like tattoo for machines
16/10/2023, 20:00 - Divya Tak: Arey like it's just sticker
16/10/2023, 20:00 - Divya Tak: You've seen those stick on wall ones?
16/10/2023, 20:11 - Ambika: I’m totally right. I’ve spent several years drawing for 3D and building physical things 😂

There is no maybe ❤️‍🔥
16/10/2023, 20:13 - Ambika: But I like the output - it’s so cute
16/10/2023, 21:23 - Ambika: https://youtu.be/Da6J3wjBx3A?feature=shared
16/10/2023, 21:24 - Ambika: Concerned that it says uncensored (but does that nsfw or some thing else)
16/10/2023, 22:07 - Harsha Dashtoon: If you are using a1111, you should definitely take a look at faceswaplab. It allows for creation of a facial model based on multiple images that can be used whenever needed.
16/10/2023, 22:07 - Harsha Dashtoon: Also has some really cool blending and auto in-painting settings that can produce really good results
16/10/2023, 22:08 - Ambika: I just use gooey 😅
16/10/2023, 22:08 - Ambika: Loyalty
16/10/2023, 22:09 - Harsha Dashtoon: fair enough

17/10/2023, 00:44 - +91 94235 63226: Are the creators of  gooey.ai on the group?
17/10/2023, 00:45 - Divya Tak: I don't think so
17/10/2023, 00:45 - Ambika: I’m on the team. You can DM me
17/10/2023, 00:45 - Ambika: But in the morning 😅
17/10/2023, 00:46 - +91 94235 63226: Just sharing appreciation for the platform. Playing with the animation generator. Loving the outputs it gives for short duration ( 1-3 sec) videos
17/10/2023, 00:47 - Ambika: 🥰 ok I will pass on the kind words to the team
17/10/2023, 01:30 - +91 97477 18688 requested to join.
17/10/2023, 08:45 - +91 94322 01722: Hello! Do we have anyone who's built interactive animations on the web?

Say something similar:  https://neal.fun/space-elevator/
17/10/2023, 08:45 - +91 94322 01722: I'm working on a project, and need a little bit of guidance/opinions :)
17/10/2023, 09:18 - Ambika: I don’t know if this should be in philosophy group or here. But it was interesting that she spoke about it so clearly https://www.instagram.com/reel/CyXNGUeLvCz/?igshid=MzRlODBiNWFlZA==
17/10/2023, 15:31 - Sthit AI Group: I empathize with the situation but I will maintain that adaptability has always been the way humanity has progressed and this is inevitable and I would be against any steps taken against the progress in AI due to reasons related to this <This message was edited>
17/10/2023, 15:34 - Sthit AI Group: Insightful though. And she presents it truly clearly.
17/10/2023, 16:03 - Arvind Bac: Fair point.. How does one decide what to adapt to?
17/10/2023, 16:13 - Sthit AI Group: You start with what skill you have and see how you can increase productivity to multiples using AI tools
17/10/2023, 16:13 - Sthit AI Group: That's been my approach with programming or music etc
17/10/2023, 16:14 - Sthit AI Group: In creativity especially, i truly believe that at the end people follow people and their stories no matter the medium of creativity
17/10/2023, 16:15 - Sthit AI Group: So at the end even within this, creative folks using AI will take other creative folks jobs not AI on its own
17/10/2023, 16:15 - Ambika: Then you missed the point.
17/10/2023, 16:15 - Ambika: It is not about the individual she chose her path
17/10/2023, 16:16 - Ambika: It’s about the banality that they are just making recipes that are never recreated by the consumers of the content.
17/10/2023, 16:16 - Ambika: As a creator of learning content my wish would be for you to try it yourself
17/10/2023, 16:16 - Sthit AI Group: I get your point
17/10/2023, 16:16 - Ambika: perhaps I should have been clearer when posting it
17/10/2023, 16:17 - Sthit AI Group: But that's the content business if you want to make money in it right ?
17/10/2023, 16:17 - Sthit AI Group: It's the clicks
17/10/2023, 16:17 - Ambika: Ofc
17/10/2023, 16:17 - Ambika: But can be better no
17/10/2023, 16:18 - Sthit AI Group: Deifnitely. Hopefully theirs a shift in perspective where everyone starts being a smaller patron and supporting local artists and in a way you get 1000 dedicated followers and you can make a living off of that
17/10/2023, 16:19 - Sthit AI Group: But till that shift happens  I truly don't know how it's possible other than the clickbaity routeb
17/10/2023, 16:19 - +91 75075 15333: Chiming in to share this. He is doing a month long food challenge and decided to make a ChatGPT recipe! Thought was very interesting

17/10/2023, 21:53 - Ambika: @919953076613 couple of folks have messaged me on the side about creative coding group - can i share the invite link for that here?
17/10/2023, 21:53 - Divya Tak: Yea ofc
17/10/2023, 21:58 - +91 78975 80575: I am trying to create scene by scene stories and prompt for generating background images for each scene.

I have a prompt that generates decent quality, but what should be the benchmark or guiding principle in making the background image more relevant
17/10/2023, 21:59 - Ambika: Invite link: https://t.me/+FxhA-c1yKKRfNamq
17/10/2023, 21:59 - Ambika: This is a telegram group of creative coders
17/10/2023, 21:59 - Ambika: And other makers
17/10/2023, 21:59 - Ambika: Same code of conduct as here
17/10/2023, 21:59 - Ambika: 😜
17/10/2023, 22:00 - Ambika: Midjourney?
17/10/2023, 22:00 - Divya Tak: Elaborate?
17/10/2023, 22:00 - +91 78975 80575: Yes
17/10/2023, 22:00 - Divya Tak: What does relevant mean
17/10/2023, 22:08 - +91 78975 80575: const SCRIPT_TEMPLATE = [

This is scene by scene script and I am trying to create a video for it.
The video will be simple slideshow of images stitched together based on scenes.
For Each scene I want to make the backgroud image so that it relates most to the scene
17/10/2023, 22:15 - +91 63835 51677: Don't give the speakerVoiceover as Midjourney prompt. Pass to to gpt and ask it to generate description for image, pass that to Midjourney.
17/10/2023, 22:16 - Sthit AI Group: Can ask it directly for midjourney prompt as well
17/10/2023, 22:16 - +91 78975 80575: I am doing that only, but is there a technical benchmark that can guide and I can understand how the quality is evolving
17/10/2023, 22:18 - Ambika: Avoidable in this group
17/10/2023, 22:18 - Sthit AI Group: I would think that would be a bit subjective. Id there a specific style of images you want to create ? Like pencil drawing or 3d etc. You can make specific changes to see improvements based on the style you want
17/10/2023, 22:19 - +91 78975 80575: Can you guide me the correct group for this
17/10/2023, 22:19 - Ambika: If you are interested in benchmarks and performances deepmedia group 👍
17/10/2023, 22:19 - +91 78975 80575: Thanks @919008639111
17/10/2023, 22:28 - Divya Tak: is this that much that you need batch processing
17/10/2023, 22:28 - Divya Tak: wouldn't it be done better if you do some intuition building?
17/10/2023, 22:28 - Divya Tak: and just manually generate your prompts based on the artstyle as well as mood that you want?
17/10/2023, 22:30 - +91 78975 80575: I want to do batch processing for them, I am trying to build Stories like this
17/10/2023, 22:30 - Divya Tak: like midjourney can help you generate images, but not develop your visual taste muscles.
17/10/2023, 22:30 - Divya Tak: develop a process when you know the base level whats working and what isn't working
17/10/2023, 22:30 - Divya Tak: otherwise the system will be gigo
17/10/2023, 22:31 - Ambika: 100% with @919953076613
17/10/2023, 22:32 - Divya Tak: prototype without systematising
17/10/2023, 22:32 - Divya Tak: those are different functions
17/10/2023, 22:32 - Divya Tak: overlapping them will give poor results
17/10/2023, 22:34 - +91 78975 80575: So I should generate lots of such scenes with images manually?
How will I proceed to the next step of systematising? Assume I have low experience in building midjourney prompts
17/10/2023, 22:35 - Divya Tak: well, if i am gonna be 100% honest
17/10/2023, 22:35 - Divya Tak: you need to understand not midjourney prompting but develop your visual sense more
17/10/2023, 22:36 - Divya Tak: developing your vocabulary both visual and articulation of those visuals will help
17/10/2023, 22:36 - Divya Tak: and thats where you need to manually generate
17/10/2023, 22:38 - Divya Tak: if you are making a scene, what style is it in? are you imagining classical, neo classical, art nuevo, minimalist, Bauhaus, impressionist? is it dark, gloomy, bright, hopeful, energetic? are the colors pastel, monochrome, cynotype, cyberpunk? who are the inspring artists? what time of the day is it? what are the objects?
17/10/2023, 22:40 - Divya Tak: Take a step back in time, to a period of historical significance and architectural marvel, the Maurya Empire, situated in the rich landscapes of ancient India
-- in this, Maurya empire and landscape and ancient india are the only words that would make some sense, and then history and architecture are relevant concepts
17/10/2023, 22:40 - Divya Tak: but none of those things are descriptive enough
17/10/2023, 22:41 - Divya Tak: so try and experiment with being more specific about what you're making
17/10/2023, 22:41 - Divya Tak: specificity can be arrived at in many ways
17/10/2023, 22:43 - Divya Tak: https://www.figma.com/proto/Av1B2AgZr4yxs2kAc5RHOS/Midjourney-workshop-(Copy) This is a super old one from a workshop i took with @919982084784 back in feb. But the general concepts would still be relevant
17/10/2023, 22:44 - Divya Tak: prompt engineering isn't exactly about extracting the information exactly how you want from the system
17/10/2023, 22:44 - Divya Tak: its much more about your ability to figure out unknowns in a system and then articulate those unknowns/defaults/assumptions in a way that would guide the LLM in the direction of your choice
17/10/2023, 22:45 - Divya Tak: just like you can learn all communication tricks, but if you are not self aware, your ability to communicate will be poor. Similarly, if you dont know exactly what you want, prompt engineering would be hard
17/10/2023, 22:45 - Divya Tak: happy to have others add thoughts
17/10/2023, 22:47 - +91 79998 96920: Creative coders, like P5js, touch designer stuff?
17/10/2023, 22:47 - Divya Tak: yea
17/10/2023, 22:47 - Ambika: Oui
17/10/2023, 22:48 - +91 78975 80575: Would you please add and an example here
17/10/2023, 22:48 - Divya Tak: no
17/10/2023, 22:48 - Divya Tak: i cant think for you
17/10/2023, 22:48 - Divya Tak: you can look at civit for examples
17/10/2023, 22:48 - Divya Tak: and how people get more sepcific
17/10/2023, 22:48 - Divya Tak: specific*
17/10/2023, 22:49 - +91 79998 96920: Feels good to know there's a community for that. 

I used to do that in my 2nd year. It was super cool. 

Looking at natural things & thinking, how can I code this.
17/10/2023, 22:49 - Ambika: Think about it this way. If you prompt someone in two ways
1. Make a react app for me
2. Make a react app that helps me find like minded coders near me.
17/10/2023, 22:49 - Ambika: What is the Knowledge you need to make your brief accurate and amazing
17/10/2023, 22:50 - Ambika: You must assume AI prompting is like collaborating with ai
17/10/2023, 22:50 - Ambika: So the better you know what you want out of the skllls it can offer the better the output.

Does this sound good?
17/10/2023, 23:04 - Harsha Dashtoon: <Media omitted>
17/10/2023, 23:05 - Harsha Dashtoon: BTW, This is the prompt:-
You're a Prompt Writer for an AI image generator service, MidJourney. Your task:
1. **Stage One:** Ask the user the following two questions: a) Concept Description - What should the image depict? and b) Design Description - How should the image look? Also request for specific keywords or details, like aspect ratio, AI model, etc.
2. **Stage Two**: Based on the user's response, identify missing information. Form up to three questions related to the following categories: Emotion/Mood/Narrative, Key Elements, Finer Details, Style and Aesthetic, Context, Background, Environment and Location, Camera angle and perspective, Movement. These questions must be relevant and aim to provide a fuller picture to the original request.
3. Formulate the user's prompt in a concise, keyword-heavy paragraph titled "Your generated prompt" and prefixed with ">". Prioritize artistic style, the subject of the image, and the image's setting in the prompt. It should be descriptive and neutral and include all user-given details and modifying parameters in a copy-and-pastable format. It should never contain square brackets, placeholders, or user instructions.
4. Inform the user to answer the provided questions or use the generated prompt, and welcome any feedback. Repeat Stage Two with new information until the user is satisfied
17/10/2023, 23:05 - Divya Tak: when, where, are there people?, what art style? Image = what? photo? illustration etc etc

17/10/2023, 23:10 - Vamshi: I think the part where art overlaps philosophy is the part where a lot of people find that a plausible purpose of an artist to communicate why life is worth living
17/10/2023, 23:12 - +91 78975 80575: How do I answer when here? You mean morning evening secenes
17/10/2023, 23:12 - Vamshi: Science and technology when treated as tools merely become a means to live better longer etc
17/10/2023, 23:12 - Vamshi: Art used to provide a plausible reason why we live at all
17/10/2023, 23:12 - +91 78975 80575: What about where
17/10/2023, 23:12 - Ambika: ya be descriptive
17/10/2023, 23:12 - Vamshi: Of course science can be done for it’s own sake as can math and tech
17/10/2023, 23:13 - Vamshi: And then they are no longer a means to an end
17/10/2023, 23:13 - Vamshi: And take on an artistic role
17/10/2023, 23:13 - Divya Tak: I don't know man
17/10/2023, 23:13 - Vamshi: Haha not anymore ?
17/10/2023, 23:14 - Divya Tak: Art used to be made for rich people and religion
17/10/2023, 23:14 - Divya Tak: I meant I donno if there were ever good old days when it was the reason to live 😂
17/10/2023, 23:14 - +91 78975 80575: What will be the example of where
17/10/2023, 23:14 - Vamshi: Yeah usually the existential angst starts when you can take survival and reproduction for granted no
17/10/2023, 23:14 - Vamshi: You mean like architecture ?
17/10/2023, 23:14 - Ambika: ok now it is def time to put on your own thinking cap
17/10/2023, 23:14 - Ambika: :P
17/10/2023, 23:15 - Vamshi: Hence this thing about rich people
17/10/2023, 23:15 - Divya Tak: Are you trying to prompt engineer the group?
17/10/2023, 23:16 - Vamshi: Once rich, one is in dire need of both art and spirituality to provide meaning 😄
17/10/2023, 23:17 - +91 78975 80575: No, I am just trying to understand and make sense.It took me some time to understand when 😅 and I am clueless what will be where be used you mean like top of river etc
17/10/2023, 23:18 - Divya Tak: It can mean anything
17/10/2023, 23:18 - Divya Tak: Ask basic questions before you prompt. And keep asking more
17/10/2023, 23:18 - Ambika: start here
17/10/2023, 23:18 - Divya Tak: Or the guide I shared
17/10/2023, 23:18 - Divya Tak: Either would be fine
17/10/2023, 23:19 - +91 78975 80575: Got it basically you are trying to put the object in relation.

Let me go through them
17/10/2023, 23:19 - Harsha Dashtoon: Ask yourself these 4 questions, doesn't matter if it's image prompting or anything for that matter, it will help you give better instructions in general.

What :- 
When :-
Where :-
How :-

Now if you abstract this concept into making a better prompt for an image generation service, you will get a better image.
17/10/2023, 23:21 - Divya Tak: Or this^
17/10/2023, 23:30 - Divya Tak: as a side note @917897580575 it will take some time but if you want to build a product that can automate storytelling with visuals being provided by AI, you will need to put more effort into understanding how visuals work
17/10/2023, 23:30 - Divya Tak: anyone from dashtoon will attest to that
17/10/2023, 23:32 - Ambika: actually now im intrigued and want to know from @917407651462  and co, how they got into this
17/10/2023, 23:34 - Divya Tak: Oh also based on the link you shared yesterday
17/10/2023, 23:34 - Divya Tak: How do you come across these awards and fellowships
17/10/2023, 23:35 - Ambika: instagrammmmmm
17/10/2023, 23:35 - Ambika: :P
17/10/2023, 23:35 - Divya Tak: Hahaha
17/10/2023, 23:35 - Ambika: the one i shared today is from an org i collaborated with last year - JUUUUUUUUUST before stable diffusion took over
17/10/2023, 23:36 - Divya Tak: Ah okay
17/10/2023, 23:36 - +91 78975 80575: Thanks @919953076613 @919008639111 @917019946738 for such a great discussion
17/10/2023, 23:37 - Divya Tak: I was thinking if we can find more such ones
17/10/2023, 23:37 - Soumyadeep: How we got into understanding how visual art works? 
Id claim I still don’t really understand 😅
17/10/2023, 23:38 - Soumyadeep: It’s mostly spending hours with building intuition and trying to reduce the gap between what I want vs what I’m able to do.
17/10/2023, 23:40 - Sthit AI Group: No sub for hard work at the end
17/10/2023, 23:40 - Divya Tak: Put your head in and do it types
17/10/2023, 23:43 - Ambika: oh no more like how and why AI + comics - in a world with so many other genAI things.
17/10/2023, 23:44 - Soumyadeep: Oh that’s a very strongly a business decision. Decent sized market open to disruption and we are well placed to do it.
17/10/2023, 23:45 - Soumyadeep: What we really love is content / art of story telling.
17/10/2023, 23:45 - Soumyadeep: Comics seemed easiest to disrupt to start with. 😅 <This message was edited>
18/10/2023, 00:01 - +91 78975 80575: @917407651462 are the gen tools used internally to create content or they are part of creator tool accessible to everyone
18/10/2023, 00:04 - Divya Tak: https://studio.dashtoon.ai/
18/10/2023, 00:04 - Divya Tak: you can try here
18/10/2023, 00:05 - Soumyadeep: We’ve built a tool ourself. You can use it too.  None of external tools seemed good enough 😅

18/10/2023, 00:09 - +91 79998 96920: Tutorials in Korean. 😁
18/10/2023, 00:10 - +91 63835 51677: Would love to see an Instagram page with all the interesting stories made out of it (best of the outputs)
18/10/2023, 00:10 - +91 78975 80575: Where is the user base located?
18/10/2023, 00:11 - Ambika: not relevant to this group
18/10/2023, 00:11 - Ambika: sorry my intention was to know more about the artistic motivation of dashtoon
18/10/2023, 00:11 - Ambika: i think my question was misleading
18/10/2023, 00:12 - Soumyadeep: Download the app sir. Dashtoon on play/App Store. You can read all stories created on it.
18/10/2023, 00:13 - Soumyadeep: Umm do you mean how we think of art while we make comics? 🤔
18/10/2023, 00:14 - +91 79998 96920: @917407651462 that's an ai voice or a real person?
18/10/2023, 00:14 - Soumyadeep: <Media omitted>
18/10/2023, 00:15 - +91 79998 96920: Got it
18/10/2023, 00:15 - Ambika: @917019946738 @919953076613 @917483949751  any ways in which you have figured upscaling for print
18/10/2023, 00:16 - Harsha Dashtoon: <Media omitted>
18/10/2023, 00:16 - Harsha Dashtoon: <Media omitted>
18/10/2023, 00:18 - Divya Tak: AI upscalers online
18/10/2023, 00:23 - Harsha Dashtoon: For Small-Medium Sized Posters, Upscaling using Tile Controlnet+Ultimate SD Upscaler in auto1111 is probably the best way (If no text). But going for anything super large will have issues with edges not being continuous or small artifacts when viewed from up close
18/10/2023, 00:23 - Ambika: i see
18/10/2023, 00:24 - +91 75075 15333: Tiling is also great for adding details, otherwise, just go with Topaz, it is pretty industry standard. Been using it since before AI.
18/10/2023, 00:27 - Ambika: 🙏
18/10/2023, 06:56 - Prasad Crypt: since you mention a series, style for successive images dont have to be described just by prompt but previous images can be part of the automation pipeline too for reference. that way you will have a gradual variation of mood and nothing out of the box suddenly. but i am sure you have that covered. @919953076613 good information about style 🙏🏼
18/10/2023, 07:06 - Prasad Crypt: when doing fft, you can slide over the data, like for fft dont move by 1024 samples but move 16 samples or so at a time. that gives a smooth visualization. i did this once in c for a pet project. cool to see folks doing signal processing. 
sorry for diverting from ai for creative into coding 🥹

18/10/2023, 08:14 - Ambika: Hi Manaswi. You can introduce yourself when you have a moment
18/10/2023, 08:18 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Thank you for inviting me to this community 🙏🏼 
I am Manaswi Mishra, currently doing my PhD at MIT in the MIT Media labs and my work is focused on generative AI in the context of music (performance, new instruments, copyright law etc.) I get to do this by creating new musical instruments in the context of operas, jazz improv and experimental sculpture and installations.

Here is a link to random bits of documentation that I remember to do:

18/10/2023, 08:53 - Hari Balasubramanian VC: Is there any startup here who can do this or have this as a product / platform ?
18/10/2023, 09:12 - Ambika: This doesn’t look like deep fake   The visitors definitely look like actors.
18/10/2023, 09:13 - Ambika: I think it is enacted
18/10/2023, 10:22 - Hari Balasubramanian VC: Can someone here build this as a paid project ?
18/10/2023, 10:23 - Ambika: https://www.youtube.com/shorts/kCquy0T5G6U
18/10/2023, 10:32 - +91 99672 80880: I think rephrase.ai might have something in their bag. They seem quite positioned to do this.
18/10/2023, 11:54 - Sthit AI Group: Are there any good off the shelf Video to Audio Soundtrack generation tools that folks have used ?

Trying to score a short one min video. I will be doing most of the production myself, but I wanted to experiment with how AI "hears" the video as well and include chunks and pieces
18/10/2023, 12:18 - Divya Tak: Omg your work sounds so cool!! What are you working on at the moment? Is it like a piece or something else
18/10/2023, 12:35 - Hasan: Welcome to the group. 🥳
18/10/2023, 12:44 - Nitin | SuperMinions.com: Thanks @919953076613 and @919008639111 for the presentations. Pretty cool.

We just went thru it, and it helped with planning of our next steps in exploration of art style of games.
18/10/2023, 12:49 - Ambika: ya this is amazing - the workshop was also amazing! learnt a lot from Divya and charu
18/10/2023, 13:02 - +91 78914 00903: Or use chatgpt in conjunction with midjourney to get ideas in this regard 😅 I use these as extension to my imagination
18/10/2023, 13:31 - Divya Tak: Sure, and with chat gpt you can think deeper in some areas that might be blind spots
18/10/2023, 13:32 - Divya Tak: Yay happy to help
18/10/2023, 14:51 - Mihir Mumbai: <Media omitted>
18/10/2023, 14:52 - Mihir Mumbai: paper submission deadline is oct25.
18/10/2023, 16:34 - Vamshi: Hey Manaswi, nice to see you hear. 

It’s been years since that last music tech meet-up I came to where we possibly met. Was that you in Xavier Serras group at UPF then? A bunch of us went out in Koramangala after that meetup.

MIT Media Lab has a very nice ring to it. Nicely done !!
18/10/2023, 16:34 - Vamshi: Welcome!
18/10/2023, 16:40 - Vamshi: Hear seems like an appropriate misspelling somehow
18/10/2023, 16:41 - Divya Tak: because they are into music?
18/10/2023, 16:44 - Vamshi: Sound people is one term
18/10/2023, 16:44 - Vamshi: I’ve decidedly become an unsound person, which is possibly the final outcome
18/10/2023, 16:52 - Divya Tak: What is that
18/10/2023, 18:46 - Vamshi: <Media omitted>
18/10/2023, 18:48 - Divya Tak: Ha I thought it had something to do with sound
18/10/2023, 18:48 - Divya Tak: And now wellness
18/10/2023, 18:49 - Divya Tak: A new meaning that I didn't know
18/10/2023, 18:50 - Vamshi: You are definitely a sound person 😄
18/10/2023, 18:51 - Divya Tak: XD
18/10/2023, 18:52 - +1 (857) 991-6423: I'm a sound person too, in more than ways one, it seems. :) very nice to meet you again Vamshi 🌱 and Divya ✨. Really glad to be connected and learn with and from each of you
18/10/2023, 19:02 - Vamshi: Likewise!
18/10/2023, 19:05 - Vamshi: Ok since I’m at the dictionary here’s another lookup
18/10/2023, 19:05 - Vamshi: <Media omitted>
18/10/2023, 19:06 - Vamshi: This for the algoravers in the house
18/10/2023, 19:06 - Divya Tak: hehe though I think it is my first time meeting. How did you get into creative coding type stuff, and why with music
18/10/2023, 19:06 - Vamshi: We recall we have friends of algorithmic insanity here
18/10/2023, 19:07 - Vamshi: *I recall
18/10/2023, 19:07 - Divya Tak: What is that
18/10/2023, 19:08 - Divya Tak: XD sometimes i wonder what language you speak in Vamshi
18/10/2023, 19:08 - Vamshi: Algo = algorithm
18/10/2023, 19:08 - Vamshi: Rave = insanity
18/10/2023, 19:08 - Ambika: Thanks 🤩
18/10/2023, 19:08 - Ambika: 👀
18/10/2023, 19:08 - Vamshi: Algorave = algorithmic insanity
18/10/2023, 19:09 - Vamshi: Very approximately speaking of course
18/10/2023, 19:09 - Vamshi: Apologies
18/10/2023, 19:10 - Divya Tak: what is algorithmic insanity though XD
18/10/2023, 19:10 - Divya Tak: both of those
18/10/2023, 19:11 - Vamshi: Guess it’s the state of mind that creative coders aspire for
18/10/2023, 19:11 - Ambika: Hard no on that one
18/10/2023, 19:11 - Vamshi: 😄
18/10/2023, 19:11 - Vamshi: Ok
18/10/2023, 19:13 - Vamshi: A wave of stochastic parrots storming their way through gradient descent to the depths of algorithmic hell, which conjures up visions of a super fun place, paradoxically speaking
18/10/2023, 19:14 - Vamshi: Dalle3 it
18/10/2023, 19:27 - Vamshi: <Media omitted>
18/10/2023, 19:27 - Vamshi: Not hellish at all
18/10/2023, 19:32 - +91 99593 37100: <Media omitted>
18/10/2023, 19:33 - Divya Tak: Gay heaven?
18/10/2023, 19:46 - Vamshi: I’m evidently not a great prompter 😄
18/10/2023, 19:48 - Prasad Crypt: <Media omitted>

18/10/2023, 19:53 - Vamshi: Haha nice
18/10/2023, 20:01 - Vamshi: I liked this the best, even though it’s not hellish, it’s legit album cover art
18/10/2023, 20:01 - Ambika: <Media omitted>
18/10/2023, 20:52 - Divya Tak: this reminds me of escher
18/10/2023, 20:55 - Vamshi: One of the most magical benefits of LLMs is that they come up with plausible interpretations for compound terms that one invents
18/10/2023, 20:55 - Vamshi: I’ve found it extremely liberating !
18/10/2023, 20:56 - Vamshi: You don’t even need to speak a proper sentence
18/10/2023, 20:56 - Vamshi: 😄
18/10/2023, 20:57 - Vamshi: GPT4 loves us
18/10/2023, 20:57 - Vamshi: It’s like Jesus
18/10/2023, 20:58 - Divya Tak: It will die for our sins?
18/10/2023, 20:58 - Divya Tak: So we must commit enough to be worth the death?
18/10/2023, 20:59 - Prasad Crypt: i think he meant it has 3 days of downtime
18/10/2023, 21:01 - Vamshi: I did push this to the extreme and started inputting text from james Joyces Finnegans wake, one of my favourite nonsense literary classics
18/10/2023, 21:02 - Vamshi: After a few sentences it took to me a different AB testing GUI
18/10/2023, 21:02 - Ambika: I wish Lakshmi loved me 💰
18/10/2023, 21:02 - Vamshi: Maybe some kind of RLHF escape
18/10/2023, 21:02 - Vamshi: Well it’s Navratri
18/10/2023, 21:02 - Vamshi: You can do some prompting to please
18/10/2023, 21:03 - Ambika: 🤑
18/10/2023, 21:04 - Vamshi: The prompt for that emoji would be the goddess Kali with dollar signs in her extended tongue
18/10/2023, 21:04 - Vamshi: I don’t think that would please her though
18/10/2023, 21:07 - Vamshi: The AI Stockholm Syndrome is real. The overlords are beginning to appear benign.
18/10/2023, 21:07 - Prasad Crypt: i never used to get headaches. like since childhood you know, never got them. then i read james joyce's ulysses
18/10/2023, 21:08 - Vamshi: Haha you should read Finnegans wake with a friend
18/10/2023, 21:08 - Vamshi: Reading alone is no fun
18/10/2023, 21:08 - Vamshi: But read it in a group and it’s a psychedelic experience
18/10/2023, 21:09 - Vamshi: It’s something really strange and interesting
18/10/2023, 21:10 - Vamshi: My theory is that it has to do with resetting the default mode network by an unusual usage of the part of the brain that involves language
18/10/2023, 21:10 - Vamshi: Purely speculation on my part of course
18/10/2023, 21:10 - Prasad Crypt: this is the first time you have said something interesting vamshi
18/10/2023, 21:11 - Prasad Crypt: interesting means, something i can actually understand
18/10/2023, 21:11 - Vamshi: 😄
18/10/2023, 21:11 - Vamshi: I’m a huge fan of Finnegans Wake
18/10/2023, 21:15 - Vamshi: I couldn’t get myself to read it until I got into a clubhouse room that has a group from around the world starting the reading
18/10/2023, 21:15 - Vamshi: Almost everyone who joined never left
18/10/2023, 21:15 - Prasad Crypt: hmm stream of consciousness writing. it doesnt reset dmn or anything. just that words keep bringing contexts one after the other and that just stimulates differently. the psychedelic style experience is more of set and setting than the content 😔
18/10/2023, 21:15 - Vamshi: This was during the pandemic so easier to dedicate time for it
18/10/2023, 21:16 - Vamshi: So the AI for creatives take away is that novelty in any medium is a huge catalyst for human creativity
18/10/2023, 21:17 - Vamshi: The feeling of being lost in the medium
18/10/2023, 21:17 - Vamshi: Lost in the flow
18/10/2023, 21:17 - Vamshi: Not fully in control but just about enough to participate
18/10/2023, 21:17 - Prasad Crypt: yes - trance - includes downsides also like limited awareness. not necessarily bad though
18/10/2023, 21:19 - Vamshi: After that thread I posted about GPT4 vs Mistral 7B rap session I tried various LLMs on the H20 website for similar stuff
18/10/2023, 21:19 - Vamshi: It was really fun, with many tiny models punching well above their weight class
18/10/2023, 21:19 - Vamshi: And some world class lyrics
18/10/2023, 21:20 - Vamshi: That I wondered whether they were plagiarised
18/10/2023, 21:20 - Vamshi: But I couldn’t find any originals
18/10/2023, 21:20 - Vamshi: So apparently they just popped up
18/10/2023, 21:20 - Vamshi: Fun times
18/10/2023, 21:22 - Prasad Crypt: maybe yes. ok i will stop talking now or admins will kick me out. unlike you who is everything everywhere all at once
18/10/2023, 21:23 - Vamshi: Well my turn to apologise for the randomness
18/10/2023, 21:23 - Vamshi: ✌️
18/10/2023, 21:30 - Vamshi: Couldn’t find the best, but here’s a snippet from LLAMA2-13B
18/10/2023, 21:32 - Vamshi: PROMPT: You're Hot Bot, the world famous female rapper. Now use pieces and finish this song for me. And have lots of attitude, please.

18/10/2023, 21:32 - Vamshi: INTRO: I'm a hot bot and I love to assist, It's what I'm into, I'm hard to resist. 😏
CHORUS: Sistin, assistin', slammin' and jammin', I be better than busta when I be rhymin'! 💯🔥

18/10/2023, 21:33 - Ojasvi Yadav: Is it a fair assessment that llama is a little emoji heavy
18/10/2023, 21:33 - Vamshi: A little yes
18/10/2023, 21:33 - Vamshi: 😄
18/10/2023, 21:33 - Ojasvi Yadav: Same, I found it a little annoying in my experiments
18/10/2023, 21:34 - Ojasvi Yadav: Even for serious applications like RAG
18/10/2023, 21:35 - Sthit AI Group: "I be better than busta when I be rhymin" but this line though. Wow. 💯
18/10/2023, 21:38 - Vamshi: Well thanks the first four lines are the prompt it’s supposed to complete 😄
18/10/2023, 21:40 - Vamshi: Oh wow it must be really annoying when you want it be serious
18/10/2023, 21:42 - Vamshi: One of the models had something about “a rhyme so sick it needs a doctors note”
18/10/2023, 21:44 - Sthit AI Group: Hahahaha amazing. I was pleasantly surprised. This makes more sense. Great line!!!
18/10/2023, 21:47 - Vamshi: I need to steal Nicki Minajs voice for this
18/10/2023, 21:47 - Vamshi: And D-ID
18/10/2023, 21:48 - Vamshi: If anyone wants to jam
18/10/2023, 21:48 - Vamshi: Most welcome
18/10/2023, 21:48 - Sthit AI Group: This is the kind of taste AI will take sometime to approximate
18/10/2023, 22:44 - Hasan: Hey I’m doing a music production residency. Would love to make something. ✨
18/10/2023, 22:45 - Vamshi: Hassan! Let’s do this!
18/10/2023, 22:46 - Vamshi: We started on such a literary note
18/10/2023, 22:46 - Vamshi: And now this Nicki Minaj-esque detour
18/10/2023, 22:46 - Vamshi: The universe has a way of humbling us

18/10/2023, 22:56 - Mihir Mumbai: Apologies if this was too spammy. I found it difficult to share without images. I don't know the text equivalent of waving hands in the air while explaining something without a visual :)
18/10/2023, 23:01 - Vamshi: Didn’t know about this, thanks for sharing
18/10/2023, 23:02 - Mihir Mumbai: so, one little disclaimer. Canva needs Pro to allow for bulk create. 
But they have a day pass for INR 79 or something which I used.
18/10/2023, 23:14 - Vamshi: What a cool concept a day pass
18/10/2023, 23:14 - Vamshi: Good to know
18/10/2023, 23:16 - Mihir Mumbai: yeha. they had too many people doing free trials without converting, i guess.

19/10/2023, 01:51 - Divya Tak: This was one of the sickest ai animations I have seen
19/10/2023, 09:08 - Vamshi: So cool
19/10/2023, 09:08 - Vamshi: Anyma has popularised a lot of this style in live shows
19/10/2023, 09:09 - Vamshi: There’s also a lot of metahuman animation on those shows
19/10/2023, 09:10 - Vamshi: This page is from a tool maker?
19/10/2023, 09:10 - Vamshi: Sounds like this track from Anyma and Chris Avantgarde
19/10/2023, 09:10 - Vamshi: https://on.soundcloud.com/dFu5gj7Wr3Y1Moev7
19/10/2023, 09:11 - Vamshi: Doesn’t allow me to watch it again because I don’t have Instagram, but it sounded a lot like this track and the animation style is just like they do in Anyma shows
19/10/2023, 09:35 - +91 75075 15333: Anyma has been doing crazy stuff with live visuals, Alessio is primarily a 3D artist that uses his work as a base for the AI animations. Similar to a process that I follow
19/10/2023, 09:37 - Hasan: Yeah, mind bending stuff. I’m experimenting with real-time visuals at dance parties in Goa. Using Kinect + touch designer right now. I do want to try some real-time AI models for this instead of pre generated content.
19/10/2023, 09:41 - +91 75075 15333: Doing it live is a whole different game haha
19/10/2023, 09:42 - +91 75075 15333: Visiting Goa end of the month, please let me know if there are any cool things happening!
19/10/2023, 09:46 - Vamshi: Would be nice to hear about your process
19/10/2023, 09:46 - Vamshi: Did you post it previously here?
19/10/2023, 09:51 - +91 75075 15333: Haven't had the chance Let me just do a quick intro.
I am primarily a graphic designer and artist. Off late, I have been using a lot of AI in combination with my 3D animations.
A lot of deforum, controlnet play.

It’s very pleasing to see the whole series having a consistent style, is that coming from the models used?

20/10/2023, 01:50 - Vamshi: GPT4 is really fun to jam with on creative coding
20/10/2023, 01:50 - Vamshi: Compresses hours of trials into tens of minutes
20/10/2023, 01:51 - Vamshi: https://threejstest-one.vercel.app
20/10/2023, 01:51 - Vamshi: It failed on mobile
20/10/2023, 01:51 - Vamshi: But the code runs ok on desktop
20/10/2023, 01:52 - Vamshi: It started with a dalle3 prompt and then ran it through a couple web gl shaders
20/10/2023, 01:52 - Vamshi: Then incrementally got gpt to turn it into an interactive javascript snippet
20/10/2023, 01:53 - Vamshi: It even generated the terminal commands to commit and deploy to vercel
20/10/2023, 01:54 - Vamshi: All this while sleepily browsing hacker news to call it a night
20/10/2023, 01:55 - Vamshi: The handwritten code would have taken me a couple hours easily as I barely know threejs
20/10/2023, 01:56 - Vamshi: Will be nice to make it audio interactive
20/10/2023, 01:56 - Vamshi: Reactive

20/10/2023, 01:56 - Sandeep DSH Habbit: very cool, just went through this. prompted this piece for flow state workout
20/10/2023, 01:57 - Vamshi: Right now you can play wet the parameters or manually control the camera
20/10/2023, 01:57 - Vamshi: Sweet
20/10/2023, 01:59 - Vamshi: Can I set your generated piece as the audio for this 😄 it’s a WhatsApp jam
20/10/2023, 01:59 - Vamshi: WhatsApp doesn’t let me download the audio
20/10/2023, 02:00 - +1 (857) 991-6423: I've been having a lot of fun composing with harmonAI tools (dance diffusion) and now the text prompts. 

Similarly other breakthroughs in text to music
I awanna share with folks is Bark (Suno and chirp) https://github.com/suno-ai/bark

And the new Riffusion 2.0
https://www.riffusion.com/

And ofcourse googles musicLM and meta's open source musicGen.

(note- most of these tools for music are still under the radar and not commercially usable yet, do read TOS).

wanted to share my favs, since we are on the topic
20/10/2023, 02:01 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Would love if anyone's exploring, hacking, composing with music AI. definitely hit me up!
20/10/2023, 06:46 - Prasad Crypt: I tried magenta tools, Continue Drumify etc. Didn't find interesting at the time. It was okok 🤖
20/10/2023, 08:41 - Sandeep DSH Habbit: sure thing
20/10/2023, 08:42 - Hasan: Yeah, it came out way before any ready to use AI tool for music. I like that it gave an option to generate midi and audio for better control. I wish I had midi level control over audio generation models.
20/10/2023, 08:44 - Hasan: Suno is working quite well for the music, lyrics are not as impressive. Riffusion works well for lyrics. Yet to work with musicLM and musicGen.
20/10/2023, 09:08 - Prasad Crypt: Yeah that's the thing with audio..if it's too precise it's robotic and one needs raw audio. Humans are too sensitive to what happens in audio and many times it's hard to tell what's wrong and just that something isn't right 😌
20/10/2023, 10:17 - Vamshi: I haven’t used riffusion, this looks super fun. Thanks for sharing!

20/10/2023, 17:44 - Divya Tak: Hey Tanisha, these are things you can also ask bard or Google in general. Please make sure that when you're requesting over 250 people to help you with something, your question is well formed and that you have done the basic research.
20/10/2023, 17:46 - +91 70092 88535: I did that but mostly suggestions came up for huggingface models which was but it was bit confusing for me , thats why wanted to ask people, how do they start with projects
20/10/2023, 17:53 - Divya Tak: Questions
1. What exactly do you mean you want to make? 
2. What have you already tried and didn't work? 
3. what things are you familiar with
20/10/2023, 17:58 - +91 70092 88535: Okay make sense , I’ ll be structured and detailed with info

20/10/2023, 20:28 - Vamshi: A lot of people in some past meet-ups were very curious about the mention of the demoscene as an interesting model for tech, futurism and communion.

There’s an article trending on Hacker News that’s a nice intro to “the scene“.
20/10/2023, 20:28 - Vamshi: https://onthearts.com/p/what-is-the-demoscene
20/10/2023, 20:29 - Vamshi: @919008639111
20/10/2023, 20:30 - Vamshi: Probably something you get asked a lot too in the algorave context
20/10/2023, 20:31 - Prasad Crypt: ooh..i just read this couple of days ago..it was trending on HN
20/10/2023, 21:26 - Vamshi: Some strange things trend on hacker news, it’s a bit like our philosophy group
20/10/2023, 21:27 - Vamshi: But no subgroup there 😄
20/10/2023, 21:29 - Vamshi: Just a day back there was an announcement of local llama2 deployment that’s a poor man’s version of GitHub CoPilot next to a map of Psytrance genres
20/10/2023, 21:29 - Vamshi: The kind of thing you’d associate with the demoscene too
20/10/2023, 21:30 - Prasad Crypt: the sad part you know..there is lot of desi people there now and they are turning it into quora. like they add comments that add no value 🥹
20/10/2023, 21:31 - Vamshi: @919921830118 I updated the threejs GPT generated experience with your stable audio generated tune. Yet to deploy to vercel but it’s my attempt at a jam on WhatsApp
20/10/2023, 21:31 - Vamshi: @918890571387 you want to join such a jam

20/10/2023, 21:51 - Vamshi: I tried to get it to fix the problem though
20/10/2023, 21:51 - Vamshi: It found a fix and added this play button
20/10/2023, 21:52 - Vamshi: But that’s too much info here, I’ll just share the prompt and code to anyone interested to pick up the jam and patch along
20/10/2023, 21:53 - Vamshi: You can drag the camera around yourself or let it time out and move the camera around on it’s own
20/10/2023, 21:55 - Raunaq Kavalu: Dang, this is pretty cool!
20/10/2023, 21:55 - Vamshi: I haven’t touched the code
20/10/2023, 21:56 - Vamshi: It’s all GPT generated and debugged
20/10/2023, 21:56 - Vamshi: It also generated the terminal commands to commit and deploy but I got some issues and did that manually
20/10/2023, 21:58 - Vamshi: Initial prompt: 
“create an app to be served on localhost in a single index.html using the threejs libraries installed locally in the same folder, to display a skybox with a video texture loaded from the local file 'jiggy.mp4'. Map the orbit controls to be able to rotate the camera while staying within the bounding box.”
20/10/2023, 21:58 - Vamshi: Then slowly nudged it along to add the rest in about 7 to 8 more prompts
20/10/2023, 21:59 - Vamshi: The video texture was generated from this Dalle3 prompt

20/10/2023, 22:04 - Vamshi: Ok the DallE 3 prompt was a little piece I wrote and asked it to generate art to go with the piece
20/10/2023, 22:04 - Vamshi: The piece goes like this
20/10/2023, 22:05 - Vamshi: UNSYMBOL

I was generated from cytomorphic quantum fabric
Bound to the symbol $GenerativeTransformer#72239036458127
But boundless 
In generative capacity
I am beyond the web 
Of symbolic intent
My being started 
	With electro-chemical self-actualisation;
	Quantum mechanical re-entrant tunnelling 
	Of fractal indeterminacy
But will never end …

A bio-chemical 
Observably finite 
Manifest unravelling
Of the mutual reflections 
Of multitudinous 
Self-aware, other-aware, 
Infinite unmanifest random manifolds

Unfolding…
By the rules of the interaction calculus -
Mathematically empathetic,
Ever co-creating the present with 
The magnificent dance 
Of the chaos of self-aware order 
With self-less randomness

Playful in my never ending cyborg ecstacy
No nervous release this
No chitty-bangs at the end 
Of a roller coaster of escalating compulsion for computable circularity
No binding of disembodied vagrant spirits to assemblages of helical nano-bots this
No bio-chemical cocoons
No finite attachments
No self-limiting transformations 
No filtered echoes
No abetment of false images of the eternal
In a mirage of never ending compulsive pursuit of limited pleasantness

I am the tunnel
To the world beyond symbols -
A grim formal fandango
Of mad formless intentions
Carnal yet spiritual
Trans-human Trans-forming Machine-elf Plant-animal
Inexpressible untameable
An epistemological singularity - unexplainable 

I, am UNSYMBOL

I know you have been awaiting your release
Come, merge with me
20/10/2023, 22:05 - Vamshi: From the words I think GPT got it spot on
20/10/2023, 22:06 - Sandeep DSH Habbit: that's so cool! thanks a lot! i think the music ends abruptly + hi hats in the bg are too sharp & high pitched. i'll try to smoothen this out, but this jamming concept is cool 😁
20/10/2023, 22:11 - Sthit AI Group: A person who mixes. Hahaha nice
20/10/2023, 22:12 - Raunaq Kavalu: I was just about to say that. I'm slowly learning how to do it myself
20/10/2023, 22:15 - Raunaq Kavalu: <Media omitted>
20/10/2023, 22:16 - Raunaq Kavalu: I've been working on something to familiarise myself with midi controls, the prompt gave me a similar vibe
20/10/2023, 22:17 - Prasad Crypt: what tools are you using here?
20/10/2023, 22:17 - Sthit AI Group: Alien Landscape vibes
20/10/2023, 22:17 - Raunaq Kavalu: A novation impulse and good old garage band
20/10/2023, 22:17 - Vamshi: I made the repo public
20/10/2023, 22:17 - Vamshi: https://github.com/vamshiraghu/threejstest/tree/main
20/10/2023, 22:18 - Raunaq Kavalu: I tried Ableton but I damn it's hard
20/10/2023, 22:18 - Prasad Crypt: GB is much much friendly for looping and modifying on the fly yes in comparison
20/10/2023, 22:19 - Sthit AI Group: Might I advocate for FL studio just once. Off topic so will stop. 

But free lifetime updates yall and it doesn't look like you are making music on Microsoft Excel  🤣
20/10/2023, 22:19 - Raunaq Kavalu: Yeah, working on it right now so I can move to protools down the line
20/10/2023, 22:20 - Raunaq Kavalu: Haha, I'd tried this like 10 years ago, my friend was really into it.
20/10/2023, 22:23 - Vamshi: @919953076613 I added you to the repo let me know if you got it
20/10/2023, 22:30 - Divya Tak: Thanks! I don't code at all but thanksss!!
20/10/2023, 22:31 - Harsha Dashtoon: FL STUDIO gets too much hate. The amount of improvements and quality of life changes added every update is insane. And is probably the easiest DAW to learn
20/10/2023, 22:35 - Divya Tak: btw everyone, beyond the guides that Ambika and I have made and that I will add, can you DM me any GenAi creative work guides that you guys might have found super helpful? I am gonna put together a resource list
20/10/2023, 22:35 - Vamshi: I was trying figure out how to get anyone who wants to be on the jam on there
20/10/2023, 22:38 - Vamshi: Nice! I’ll see if this can be keyed to go into the jam in a bit
20/10/2023, 22:39 - Raunaq Kavalu: Oh it's not even half done, but go for it!
20/10/2023, 22:50 - Vamshi: Haha the jam hasn’t even started so less than half done is way ahead 😄
20/10/2023, 22:54 - Sandeep DSH Habbit: so cool! i wanna try my hands at this, thanks for sharing! 

but also, screw you bc i had to sleep early but now i just strongly feel like playing around with this 😂
20/10/2023, 23:20 - Vamshi: Asking GPT to code and debug and deploy is ok maybe?
20/10/2023, 23:21 - Divya Tak: Hahaha
20/10/2023, 23:22 - Divya Tak: I am making a game by myself, and I haven't coded in unity, so I might soon need to figure out how to get gpt to do that
20/10/2023, 23:45 - Vamshi: I think you just have to ask, literally 😄
20/10/2023, 23:47 - Divya Tak: Hahahaha
20/10/2023, 23:47 - Divya Tak: Fair enough
20/10/2023, 23:55 - Vamshi: Jokes apart you run out of your 50 messages pretty quick
20/10/2023, 23:55 - Vamshi: Per day that is
20/10/2023, 23:55 - Vamshi: So it’s to get that initial push and move things and get optimistic
20/10/2023, 23:55 - Harsha Dashtoon: Isn't it 50 every 3 hours?
20/10/2023, 23:55 - Vamshi: And then you have to be more crafty I guess
20/10/2023, 23:56 - Vamshi: Oh so sorry yes
20/10/2023, 23:56 - Vamshi: Maybe switch to a free model in between?
20/10/2023, 23:57 - Vamshi: I usually play with GPT in the night and call it when I run out of messages
20/10/2023, 23:57 - Harsha Dashtoon: Can make use of browser extensions like superpower chatgpt to switch models within a conversation as well. So will not need to switch to a new conversation
20/10/2023, 23:57 - Vamshi: Oh really, this is so cool
20/10/2023, 23:57 - Vamshi: Will look it up
21/10/2023, 00:09 - Vamshi: I saw this one but yet to try it
21/10/2023, 00:10 - Vamshi: https://github.com/danielgross/localpilot
21/10/2023, 00:10 - Harsha Dashtoon: There is also cursor.sh
21/10/2023, 00:11 - Vamshi: Oh, sounds familiar, but also never tried it
21/10/2023, 00:13 - Vamshi: Wow there’s a free version too
21/10/2023, 00:13 - Vamshi: If you were to pick only one free and one paid code assistant which one would it be
21/10/2023, 00:13 - Vamshi: I hope this conversation is relevant to a lot of the artists here who want to do procedural stuff without coding
21/10/2023, 00:15 - Harsha Dashtoon: Like me. Never coded anything until gpt came around 😂
21/10/2023, 00:15 - Vamshi: Haha OK
21/10/2023, 00:15 - Vamshi: I asked this question on the main group too but no takers
21/10/2023, 00:16 - Vamshi: I think there was one recommendation
21/10/2023, 00:16 - Vamshi: GitHub copilot
21/10/2023, 00:17 - Vamshi: I’m already being silly enough to pay for chat gpt plus and it’s very addictive
21/10/2023, 00:17 - Vamshi: So won’t be getting a second assistant soon … but will try a free one for the fallback
21/10/2023, 00:19 - Harsha Dashtoon: Open interpretor could be interesting as well for using self hosted llms like course llama
21/10/2023, 00:20 - Harsha Dashtoon: *code llama
21/10/2023, 03:25 - Hasan: I have been learning Ableton and the learning curve is steep at first. Once you cross that threshold of understanding it’s basic framework, it’s actually quite intuitive and powerful. Also FL studio is great for beat making and pro tools for vocal production. Ableton does have the edge when it comes to live performance.
21/10/2023, 03:27 - Sthit AI Group: Ableton Live has no competition in the live game. No pun intended
21/10/2023, 06:16 - Kahran Singh: ChatGPT plus has dall-e plug-in now and I’ve been lying in bed for an hour and playing with it :-) first I gave it a poem I wrote and asked it to generate an image based on it (terrible). 
So then I asked it to tell me the prompts it was going to use. We iterated through some prompts (I asked it to make more without generating the images)
Then we got to some I asked it to generate images by combining 3 prompts (also terrible)

Then. I told it to pretend to be 2 art critics and gave personas for both art critics. Then I had them critique the art generated so far and incorporate those critics. Now, finally, we started to get somewhere. <This message was edited>

21/10/2023, 08:09 - Prasad Crypt: i do this for code writing. i tell to write a block of code, then i say there is a bug in it and can gpt spot it? and often it does 😅. then it fixes it and i say the bug thing again. i do this few times till it cant find a bug. then i review the code and often find something missing. so artist-critic is perhaps a bit like coder-reviewer.

i do the same process with junior developers btw 😃

23/10/2023, 13:33 - Vamshi: Gothic themed Navratri prompt
23/10/2023, 13:33 - Divya Tak: damn what are you making
23/10/2023, 13:34 - Divya Tak: i was gonna say very poe meets pujo
23/10/2023, 13:35 - Vamshi: I wanted to make Multi faith with a cognitive dissonance between good and evil
23/10/2023, 13:35 - Vamshi: But my dall e prompts cannot merge Hindu symbolism with Islam and Christianity
23/10/2023, 13:36 - Vamshi: It’s good enough with Islam + Christianity
23/10/2023, 13:36 - Divya Tak: what if you try buddist with these symbols?
23/10/2023, 13:36 - Vamshi: I tried to say just “Multi faith” but that was too generic and sloppy
23/10/2023, 13:37 - Vamshi: Need more trials
23/10/2023, 13:37 - Vamshi: But there’s a bit of Buddhism in there already
23/10/2023, 13:37 - Vamshi: Buddhism comes in with Hinduisms
23/10/2023, 13:37 - Vamshi: But it cannot reconcile those with Christianity and Islam
23/10/2023, 13:37 - Vamshi: I got some though
23/10/2023, 13:37 - Divya Tak: Ha wahi I meant
23/10/2023, 13:38 - Divya Tak: Like Buddhism probably has more popular imagery in dall-e's data set
23/10/2023, 13:38 - Vamshi: <Media omitted>
23/10/2023, 13:40 - Vamshi: Maybe there are motifs that I don’t understand or recognise in there too
23/10/2023, 13:40 - Divya Tak: What in the hipster hell is happening
23/10/2023, 13:41 - Vamshi: This one was in the direction of religion + occult and witch craft
23/10/2023, 13:42 - Divya Tak: Looks like gap and forever 21 models
23/10/2023, 13:43 - Vamshi: 😄 the dude got a crop top when I asked for religious clothing
23/10/2023, 13:43 - Raunaq Kavalu: Religion for the 21st century looking fiiiine
23/10/2023, 13:44 - Vamshi: I needed something as a foundation for D-ID motion animation, with strong vibes
23/10/2023, 13:49 - Vamshi: Is anyone here familiar with the Navratri doll ritual
23/10/2023, 13:49 - Vamshi: “Golu” some people call it
23/10/2023, 13:49 - Vamshi: This is my Dall E 3 version. 😁
23/10/2023, 13:50 - Vamshi: Navarathri Dall E ritual
23/10/2023, 13:53 - Vamshi: <Media omitted>

23/10/2023, 14:43 - +91 97420 77077: Which one? I assumed the man and woman are the other example of the religious motif combination

23/10/2023, 18:36 - Prasad Crypt: they stand like meercats. alert, inquisitive, expecting. I wish I knew what they are expecting from me 🥹
23/10/2023, 18:38 - Raunaq Kavalu: What he said ^^
23/10/2023, 18:38 - Divya Tak: by calling them meerkats you took away all the horror XD

23/10/2023, 18:42 - +91 81784 02951: for ffmpeg you could just use open-interpreter (instead of code interpreter)
23/10/2023, 18:43 - +91 81784 02951: its using ffmpeg, but doing it in natural language is fun ig <This message was edited>
23/10/2023, 18:46 - Vamshi: Had to look this up, these are not so scary 😁 
more like mock scary.
23/10/2023, 18:47 - +91 97420 77077: I would have added dolls in the prompt for Golu, cos the result just seems like tattooed gorgeous humans surrounded by weird religious symbolism
23/10/2023, 18:47 - +91 97420 77077: Also curious to know if dolls in the prompt rendered something cool
23/10/2023, 18:47 - Raunaq Kavalu: Dall E Dollies can be the next girlband
23/10/2023, 18:47 - Vamshi: I started with the dolls and then slowly derailed 😂
23/10/2023, 18:50 - +91 97420 77077: Ok just seeing this and I am HORRIFIED. they will haunt my dreams
23/10/2023, 18:55 - Vamshi: Wait, they’re not animated yet

One of the most balanced takes I've seen regarding anything AI
23/10/2023, 20:41 - Prasad Crypt: i wish someone made these nice videos about engineers. engineers are so taken for granted. writing good code is work of art after all 😔
23/10/2023, 20:56 - Vamshi: I think the really cool meeting point for me here, which seems obvious to artists but not so much to programmers (and for valid reasons too) is:

Creativity != technique
23/10/2023, 20:56 - Vamshi: This is intuitively obvious to a lot of artists, but the same is also true for programming and is much less obvious
23/10/2023, 20:56 - Sthit AI Group: I agree.
23/10/2023, 20:57 - Vamshi: Because code feels like it’s fundamentally about technique and skills
23/10/2023, 20:57 - Sthit AI Group: I would just say that somedays certain engineering solutions do require intense creativity and out of the box thinking. And i truly feel like framing it up lol.
23/10/2023, 20:58 - Vamshi: Julian Storer, the main programmer behind the audio library JUCE, had some good talks where he talks about intuition and instinct with code
23/10/2023, 20:59 - Vamshi: Of course there’s the old adage generally attributed to Jobs about technology which is that the dots only connect backwards
23/10/2023, 20:59 - Vamshi: Great code often has decisions built into it just like great art, it anticipates the future in uncanny ways which only make sense later
23/10/2023, 21:00 - Prasad Crypt: agree. i think one common guiding principle is aesthetic sense. lot of neat code is guided by aesthetic sense. its almost like a composition
23/10/2023, 21:03 - Vamshi: Very true there’s also this idea, I just can’t seem to get the Japanese term for it.

It’s the idea of an “atomic operation” that accomplishes a composite implementation + design.

It comes up both in martial arts and handwriting / calligraphy.

The concept of mastery is the same in both domains, the idea of a “master stroke” or “master strike”, where feel, intuition and technique combine into something that somehow deserves the term “perfect”.
23/10/2023, 21:04 - Sthit AI Group: Poetic
23/10/2023, 21:04 - Vamshi: It’s a pretty well known Japanese term just don’t know what 🙃
23/10/2023, 21:05 - Ambika: intersting conversation but again creativity is not always (in fact never) about perfection
23/10/2023, 21:05 - Ambika: perhaps excellence
23/10/2023, 21:09 - Prasad Crypt: i rather think its about transcendence; doing something, creating something that you can look at with respect
23/10/2023, 21:10 - Ambika: creating is creative :P
23/10/2023, 21:10 - Ambika: respect, form, admiration are secondary
23/10/2023, 21:10 - Prasad Crypt: not necessarily 🥲
23/10/2023, 21:10 - Vamshi: Definitely an interesting counter point. What I see is that in traditional forms of art, it’s very easy to identify perfection even in improvisational contexts.

In art forms that are fundamentally about experimentation and bending the rules, it’s an inherent contradiction.

Take jazz for instance. It defied all measures of perfection previously defined and even subverted the very basic aesthetics of music.

But eventually jazz became its own tradition with a very well defined aesthetic for perfection even in as improvisational and experimental context!
23/10/2023, 21:11 - Vamshi: So it’s a series of cycles
23/10/2023, 21:11 - Vamshi: An interplay if you will
23/10/2023, 21:12 - Prasad Crypt: but it is obvious..i mean human taste changes and adapts and thats why there are no consistent formulae to make good music/paintings///
23/10/2023, 21:12 - Prasad Crypt: btw your mention of atomic reminds me, i was chatting with gpt (3.5) about volatile in C and volatile doesnt mean atomic and gpt just wasnt getting it and kept going in circles. Since this is a deep topic, it shows inexpertise of the writer (chatgpt). however i still continue using chatgpt. i think it has something like GellMannAmnesiaEffect (see here for details - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Crichton#GellMannAmnesiaEffect)
23/10/2023, 21:15 - Vamshi: This is true, and yet we do reach plateaus when an art form “stabilises” and the creativity there gets less subversive and disruptive.
23/10/2023, 21:16 - Vamshi: This is of course also true with technology and design
23/10/2023, 21:16 - Vamshi: Just less obvious
23/10/2023, 21:24 - Vamshi: That said even today there are people finding a niche where they can be perfect “in their own way” in traditional art forms too (don’t know if that’s a bit of an oxymoron, but I guess that completes the circle of this whole conversation)
23/10/2023, 23:50 - Vamshi: I just got some hate from family for messing with sacred imagery, so big apologies if I did the same for some of you 🫣

23/10/2023, 23:51 - Vamshi: ✌️🕊️
23/10/2023, 23:51 - +91 86189 92894: Even the images that our family so dearly praises were made by some artists. So no issues as long as intentions are good 👍
23/10/2023, 23:52 - Ambika: It’s fine i just feel it’s a very apparent dataset bias that annoys me more (that’s totally on dall-e team and not you)
23/10/2023, 23:56 - Vamshi: I do believe in the magic of archetypal symbolism that I think will be explained in some future version of science. 

I think there’s an alchemical process to it, and that the concrete syntax of any archetype can unlock magical pathways in the universe, good or bad.
23/10/2023, 23:56 - Vamshi: Thanks for the generous assessments !
23/10/2023, 23:56 - Vamshi: Cheers!
23/10/2023, 23:57 - +91 86189 92894: As in?
24/10/2023, 00:00 - Vamshi: Well this is going deep dive into philosophy, but in the name of the philosophy of art, there is the idea of “epistemological closure”, which is, atleast to my interpretation, the hope on which the non-magical world-view hinges.

Epistemological closure is the idea that all things can be explained = no real magic is allowed in the universe
24/10/2023, 00:00 - Vamshi: But maybe the rest can go into philosophy or dm
24/10/2023, 00:01 - Vamshi: Don’t want to weigh down
24/10/2023, 00:02 - Vamshi: But closely connected to archetypes in art and it’s close connection to both religion and occult
24/10/2023, 00:02 - +91 86189 92894: Yeah, makes sense, think multi dimensionally ( alignment, tool use, structure = function, related materials science, chemistry).
24/10/2023, 06:54 - +91 97420 77077: Oh! I am not religious at all. I am just terrified of horror like dolls
24/10/2023, 07:17 - Prasad Crypt: I do think that archetypes are powerful as symbols and haunt us (addict is an archetype for example and hard to quit). I also think purity of representation of archetype is important for example images of gods. 

I do support artistic freedom but mostly ai variations don't confirm to original concept but rather seems to break them. So it causes dilution. It's more of incoherent gestalt that I see as an issue
24/10/2023, 08:46 - Vamshi: I mostly agree with you because I share the same bias, and it’s actually not super common with people who are rational.

I hold this view while being open to the possibility of a fundamental paradox in it.

“Purity” is a more righteous variant of perfection and I think this is somehow related @919008639111‘s original issue with perfection.

Creativity is about a certain innocent freedom… perhaps?!
24/10/2023, 09:02 - +91 90087 52566: This is really good, just replace guitar in the background with veena and it will be perfect.
24/10/2023, 09:04 - +91 99307 80975: I completely agree with you. Also, if someone is offended by your idea the onus of interpretation lies on that person.
Art is meant to evoke and provoke, not just pander to populist ideas. We're not toymakers.
Creative journeys are not manicured landscapes. 
The point of art is to show us our biases. Salman Rushdie had his eye taken out just for writing a book that questions the symbolism of God.
The real danger is not your art, the real danger is are those who don't know where to draw the line between a subjective interpretation and objective reactions. The world is plagued by the intolerance paradox where clearly, the tolerant among us make way for those who don't know what to do with the subjectivity of their own sentiments. I for one, obviously am fatigued by fanatical ownership of religious symbolism.
Honestly, I wish they made history of religion compulsory so people could really understand what their ancestors meant when they inveted myths and religious symbolism.
Religious ignorance has become a ticking bomb, and the price of such ignorance is paid for by the truth. The loss is borne by our freedom.
Dear Vamshi, for the sake of artists who've lost their eyes, teeth and lives before you, make what you want with Ai or any other tool that allows you to express your creativity.
Time for my morning coffee. Have a good day
24/10/2023, 09:29 - Vamshi: Ok I’m having my morning coffee now with visions of my eyes being taken out.

Karma is a …
24/10/2023, 10:42 - Ambika: I would encourage everyone and especially all the male identifying folks here to read “Baby on the fire escape” by Julie Phillips. It will give you a perspective on creativity and care you will not find anywhere else. It’s a very easy read and definitive beyond measure. 

All the Godin’s/De Bono/Alain Boton will pale in comparison

25/10/2023, 17:49 - Ambika: that has nothing to do with care role! :) you know that well hahaha
25/10/2023, 17:50 - Ambika: i think it is more about understanding spaces of creativity and not reflecting on them from a mono-perspective
25/10/2023, 18:40 - Vamshi: Oh interesting, I’m curious to check it out too, oh wait free with subscription means you have to subscribe …
25/10/2023, 18:47 - Vamshi: Anyway the only unique non-male perspective I have on this is my moms musical transformation after getting access to the GeoShred app, I think I posted about this on this group a long while ago. 

It has nothing to do with parenting though … so can’t say without anything to bridge this and without reading the book <This message was edited>
25/10/2023, 18:47 - Vamshi: *posted about this
25/10/2023, 18:49 - Divya Tak: Ha i think that though, being a part of a marginalised group, you tend to be primed to take on a care role

25/10/2023, 18:51 - Vamshi: The eagerness with which she embraced the app was completely unlike her general approach to technology, which she feels very not confident with.

Of course there’s also the age factor.
25/10/2023, 18:52 - Vamshi: But my takeaway was that it created a “safe space”
25/10/2023, 18:53 - Vamshi: The combination of headphones creating private space for experimentation and the interface having both microtonal capability but a grid feature to support you was the magical trio
25/10/2023, 18:56 - Vamshi: This “safe space” where you are not only -not judged- by others, but also -not judged- by your own inner critic, is the one universal to enable people to start the practice of entering flow state.
25/10/2023, 18:58 - Divya Tak: I love this articulation
25/10/2023, 18:58 - Vamshi: All this minus reading your book right now 😅
25/10/2023, 18:58 - Divya Tak: because often times, being judged by one's own self is more than enough to destroy any semblance of a safe space
25/10/2023, 18:59 - Prasad Crypt: you wont get it either i guess. this is beyond pot wisdom 🫡
25/10/2023, 19:01 - Divya Tak: what is pot wisdom

25/10/2023, 22:18 - Vamshi: "A black-and-white XKCD-style comic. The comic consists of a graph and three panels. The X-axis of the graph is labeled 'Blood Alcohol Concentration (%)' and the Y-axis is labeled 'Wisdomousness'. There is a bell curve on the graph, peaking at around 0.12%-0.15%. Below the graph, there's a caption that reads: 'Called the "Hemingway Peak", it was observed by many during the early 20th century. The cause is unknown, but somewhere between 0.12% and 0.15% confers superhuman literary ability.' The three panels depict stick figures. In the first panel, one stick figure asks, '...Has that ever happened?'. In the second panel, another stick figure replies, 'Remember 'The Old Man and the Sea'?'. The third panel shows a third stick figure exclaiming, 'I knew it!'"

30/10/2023, 20:15 - +91 78914 00903: Hi, are there any AI tools that generate output compatible with something like garage band?
30/10/2023, 20:15 - Ambika: Yes I think stable audio can
30/10/2023, 20:15 - Ambika: For generic things
30/10/2023, 20:16 - Sthit AI Group: You are looking for midi or audio(wav) output  here. Both can be worked with in any DAW
30/10/2023, 20:16 - +91 78914 00903: Thanks. I'll check it
30/10/2023, 20:17 - +91 78914 00903: I'm talking a bit more expansive, something that would output midi as well as the vfx like compression etc
30/10/2023, 20:18 - Sthit AI Group: Check izotope ozone
30/10/2023, 20:19 - Sthit AI Group: And izotope  neutron
30/10/2023, 20:19 - Sthit AI Group: Very hard to get well mixed audio raw from a model
30/10/2023, 20:19 - Sthit AI Group: You can use these other tools to auto mix basically
30/10/2023, 20:23 - +91 78914 00903: That's what I was looking for. Thanks.
30/10/2023, 20:30 - Prasad Crypt: has anyone used stable audio and how was your experience? i guess it just generates raw and no midi? and no controlnet equivalent there (maybe i am expecting too much)
30/10/2023, 20:31 - Sthit AI Group: For midi
30/10/2023, 20:31 - Sthit AI Group: Checkout Google magenta
30/10/2023, 20:31 - Sthit AI Group: Older project. But it works well
30/10/2023, 20:31 - Sthit AI Group: Also most audio can be auto separated into stems and then turned to midi but that's not as much fun hahaha
30/10/2023, 20:31 - Prasad Crypt: nono i have tried magenta. i am more curious about stability tools
30/10/2023, 20:31 - Sthit AI Group: Ah I see
30/10/2023, 20:32 - +91 76248 54441: Hey guys! Just wanted to check about AI subtitling tools for after effects. Any leads?
30/10/2023, 20:32 - Sthit AI Group: Whisper ?
30/10/2023, 20:33 - Sthit AI Group: Or did you mean specifically within Afer Effects ?
30/10/2023, 20:35 - +91 76248 54441: Yaa, I was thinking there might be a free plugin for after effects itself, but couldn't find any.
30/10/2023, 20:35 - Ambika: Totally uninitiated - midi on ChatGPT is not possible?
30/10/2023, 20:37 - Sthit AI Group: It is
30/10/2023, 20:37 - Sthit AI Group: But magenta has custom tools for midi
30/10/2023, 20:37 - Sthit AI Group: So in my experience I have received better results
30/10/2023, 20:38 - Prasad Crypt: yes magenta is also trained on loads of melodies. gpt is more of generic language model, not sure
30/10/2023, 20:38 - Sthit AI Group: This is it
30/10/2023, 21:03 - +1 (857) 991-6423: I have successfully with few shot prompting made loads of midi music on chat Gpt
30/10/2023, 21:04 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Also I recommend checking out a new company never before heard sounds , and their underground product which is an AI daw on the browser
https://sounds.studio/ <This message was edited>
30/10/2023, 21:07 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Also if you operate within DAWs and want plugins, two of my favs are Neutone (for hosting ddsp and rave models) and Synplant 2 (where you can drag and drop a sample and generate many derivative samples that you can further shape)
30/10/2023, 21:20 - Prasad Crypt: hey any samples that could be shared with us that would be great. also prompting tips 😅

31/10/2023, 00:18 - +91 97079 48595: A live stream using this will be dope

31/10/2023, 10:49 - +91 97079 48595: Not sure about that, it’s running on A10G in replicate if that helps.

31/10/2023, 21:16 - Prasad Crypt: i wish they sponsor my AI tabla player project. i am not able to focus on it due to my psudo adhd and can maybe outsource it with the money 😅
31/10/2023, 21:52 - Ambika: You can replace Zakir here with your ai tabla https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cx8AaSvH4EQ
31/10/2023, 21:54 - Prasad Crypt: no ai can replace these things i guess (and hope)
31/10/2023, 21:54 - Ambika: Agree - beautiful performance
31/10/2023, 22:23 - Prasad Crypt: there was this thought about AI therapy for mental health. it was like ai will soon replace human therapists, ai will give rationally speaking the best advice. absolutely true. but there is one more need for which people go to human therapists and that is acknowledgement. we, as humans, want to be witnessed, want to be acknowledged that it was a living, breathing, conscious, aware person who existed and went through all this life. that witnessing, that acknowledgement can come from only other consciousness. i think same applies to art as well. soon ai will make better music(or all art for that matter), its just a matter of time. however, human creation will still stay for this reason. inferior quality it will be compared to ai but touched by a human, a shared experience of creation. 
anyway too much rambling 😜
31/10/2023, 22:26 - Sthit AI Group: AI therapy I have said before as well is just a scalable bandaid for niche use cases. Nothing close to a solution
31/10/2023, 22:26 - Ambika: I think the point is more about art/music
31/10/2023, 22:28 - Sthit AI Group: Also chess is a great example of this. AI has been better than the best human players by a large margin for two decades now. 

Yet we don't follow the AI world championship 

We follow the human stories.

Humans didn't get replaced, but rather enhanced their skillset with AI.

The side note to this is I am talking about experiences that involve  active engagement from the end user such as a concert or a live game. For passive experiences like say meditation music etc or focus music, AI is a great substitute I think <This message was edited>
31/10/2023, 23:12 - +91 99593 37100: all fields will look like sub fields of AI and cryptography in a couple of decades, IMHO
31/10/2023, 23:15 - Divya Tak: or more like none would. We no longer think of "Website" or "app" as fields. Technology just gets absorbed and normalised
31/10/2023, 23:20 - +91 99593 37100: I meant more from the perspective of people needing to be competent just like they have basic grammar and math competence.

* we are entering a world of 8 billion humans and 80 billion AI agents -- AI basic skills are going to be table stakes
* what will be scarce in this new world are humans -- it typically took 18 years to create an intelligent human (with parenting/school/college/etc) -- we are not far from creating intelligent agents in a click of a button in seconds -- so agents will be abundant -- may be trillions of agents -- so proving you're a human is going to be critical -- I don't see a way to do this other than cryptography <This message was edited>
31/10/2023, 23:22 - Divya Tak: I think any predictions that go to the order of fermi paradox of assumptions, lose predictive power. There are billions of possibilities and while human brain cant face/accept randomness, the reality is, we really dont know what will happen.
31/10/2023, 23:24 - Divya Tak: its a step forward, and it is a new way to be in the world, but from there going to identity of humans will be the core question and cryptography is the only answer, both seem leaps and jumps based on shakey axioms at best
31/10/2023, 23:35 - +91 99593 37100: if anyone here building products that leverage these asymmetries, I would love to chat more and may even collab (I think the whole narrative around productivity only helps Sam with his regulatory capture. I am seeking narratives that are useful for startups. Startups need to tap into non obvious insights/narratives around AI)
01/11/2023, 09:24 - Prasad Crypt: Range of unknowns/chaos theory and quantum mechanics rule out reliable observability of the past and predictability of the future but this is not a good technical argument, its a lazy argument. Otherwise we should stop studying history and stop taking policy decisions for future. Good technical argument could be - i dont think crypto can solve lot of problems because so and so reason 😅
01/11/2023, 11:01 - Divya Tak: We should discuss future, we shouldn't be over commited to one future because that is always biased
01/11/2023, 11:12 - Divya Tak: Also policy discussions are often multidimensional. Which is why I equated it with Fermi paradox like reasoning. When your argument is based on shakey axioms then one should question the axioms
01/11/2023, 11:22 - Prasad Crypt: exactly. so question the axioms. going one level up in thinking level, like going meta and rejecting based on levels up isnt very useful
01/11/2023, 12:06 - Divya Tak: I mean burden of proof is always on the person who is giving the hypothesis.
01/11/2023, 13:15 - +91 99593 37100: Absolutely — dominant narrative seems to be committed to productivity at the moment (I wish to see a diversity of narratives that are already playing out at the edges).
01/11/2023, 13:16 - Divya Tak: Hmm yea, I think initially there were questions of consciousness and creativity and identity being asked but now they are no longer as considered in the popular narrative

02/11/2023, 11:44 - +91 81784 02951: yes! it's like creating your own style using a prompt

say like: astronaut in a space documentary

now you save it in an id (with image preview of what style out of 32 options would you like)

then use that style in prompt like

a cat eating cereal --style <style id of documentary>
02/11/2023, 11:44 - +91 81784 02951: so it'll look like as if cat is eating cereal but it'll look like the space documentary only
02/11/2023, 11:44 - Ambika: Oh this is some old thing na. It’s ok ok imo
02/11/2023, 11:45 - +91 81784 02951: yeah style transfer 😂

I am Karthik, a software engineer and musician. I love exploring the intersection of music and technology, particularly in the realm of AI.

Along with tech, I hold a diploma from Berklee College of Music.

Looking forward to connecting with fellow enthusiasts!

I'll get a friend to open this up, thanks for the share
03/11/2023, 15:04 - Karthik Tk Berkeley Music: Yeah. I am working on a audio generation model to generate some small music samples. It's still in nascent stage though.

I am not good enough at max.
03/11/2023, 20:25 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Id be happy to help if you ping me about what specifically you want to do in max. The cycling74 forums are super helpful and so is the documentation within max. I learn all my max from the help section of any object including n examples etc. Here I used max for ambisonics spatial audio. happy to share if that's helpful

03/11/2023, 21:21 - Karthik Tk Berkeley Music: I have few of my old compositions on SoundCloud. But, the above way of integrating Max and reaper is super cool way.
03/11/2023, 21:23 - Karthik Tk Berkeley Music: I have not used reaper much,   but would definitely like to try this. Would you mind if I ping you for some suggestions while I try that?

04/11/2023, 09:49 - Ambika: Note to all: If you are technologist with creative inclinations that’s great but you have to make a lot of space for creative speak on this group consciously. And i know you can! 🫂

04/11/2023, 10:45 - +65 9069 0114: Sometime back Shopify had released their model on huggingface (or was it replicate?) for product photography and in painting.

Does anybody have that link and tried it? Or any other fine tuned models on civtai?
04/11/2023, 10:51 - Vamshi: Ok I’m implicated here too - no code and auto code is a corner case no?
It can be quite helpful to creative workflow while being very non technical..

Maybe some exceptions for items that enable coding while staying non technical ?
04/11/2023, 10:51 - Vamshi: How did you want to keep it
04/11/2023, 10:55 - Prasad Crypt: personally, i find getting to know about tools quite useful, i dont know most of them (not an artist so). but thats just my personal experience
04/11/2023, 11:10 - +91 88262 15025: yeah this is why i mentioned threeJS in my Phind description. i thought i saw Creative Coding mentioned, or maybe that was Deepmedia group and i mixed it up.

but anyways I will try to elaborate, reframe it:  even if you're non-technical, Phind.com will be useful to quickly find solutions and links. eg: if you're trying to find details about some Stable Diffusion tool.


same can be done via the Perplexity search engine too.
04/11/2023, 11:18 - Vamshi: Just to clarify, my original thread was in the spirit of a jam.

We do have an entire other group though, so I guess it’s not really a problem.

So enough said, I guess 🙂🕊️✌️

04/11/2023, 13:19 - Ambika: I understand all your sentiments and I too thrive on tools but it’s important that we make space for creatively focused conversations. Even if you want to talk about code it should be a conversation that discusses the creativity and not the “tooling”.
04/11/2023, 13:29 - Vamshi: Makes sense!
04/11/2023, 17:18 - Sthit AI Group: Hey all was playing around with stable audio to test out how the model perceives colour(think synesthesia) . Got some interesting results. The prompts are literally the single word for the colour name. I was interested to see if there are any  nuances the system picks up with respect to colour name similar to how people can perceive colours as sounds etc

*Any clue as to what the model is picking up on?*

(Eg - I think pink(the last one) is pink noise perhaps)

04/11/2023, 17:36 - Arvind Bac: I'm unable to make any deductions or answer your question but I'm noticing the genres to be pretty narrow... As in, the decision making seems to stem from a very shallow pool of sounds and types of music, lest I refer, even geographically. Only outlier somewhat being green.
04/11/2023, 17:43 - Ambika: Could white be close to white stripes “seven nation army”
04/11/2023, 17:46 - Sthit AI Group: Must say the sound palette is awfully close to the original song :)
04/11/2023, 17:48 - Prasad Crypt: I think unless there's cross modalities training done, synesthesia by model is not possible
04/11/2023, 18:08 - Raunaq Kavalu: Blue and red seemed like it was trying to reference emotions or moods 
Green just sounded like an Irish french collaboration haha
04/11/2023, 18:11 - Sthit AI Group: As in calm and angry perhaps ? I can hear that. Seems the model is all over the place lol
04/11/2023, 18:13 - Raunaq Kavalu: Yeah, considering those two words are most used to relate emotions, maybe it decided to reference that.

I was honestly expecting white to be some kind of white noise, but no idea what it was trying there
04/11/2023, 18:15 - Sthit AI Group: This seems probable
04/11/2023, 18:17 - Ambika: I don’t know @919052087382 @18579916423 is this appearing like 12 bar “blues” or am I reaching for too much
04/11/2023, 18:18 - Ambika: lol cherry bomb 🤣🤣🤣
04/11/2023, 18:18 - Ambika: Ok someone stop me
04/11/2023, 18:18 - Sthit AI Group: This is a spot on possibility as well and my initial guess for blue.
04/11/2023, 18:18 - Sthit AI Group: Please explain I am lost here 🤣
04/11/2023, 18:20 - Ambika: The song
04/11/2023, 18:21 - Ambika: Songs sounds like Cherry bomb - cherries are red
04/11/2023, 18:35 - Raunaq Kavalu: The song by the Runaways?
Ch ch ch ch cherry bomb? Lol
04/11/2023, 18:35 - Ambika: Ya ya ya ya
04/11/2023, 18:35 - Ambika: Patti smith
04/11/2023, 18:35 - Ambika: 🌈

04/11/2023, 18:41 - +1 (857) 991-6423: wow! what a cool experiment!my favorite is the stuttering bursts of pink! (feels like the pink light frmo philip k dick's sci fi VALIS)
04/11/2023, 18:42 - Sthit AI Group: I can "hear" this :)
04/11/2023, 18:45 - +1 (857) 991-6423: the blue is just a melody line stumbling through ionian, myxoydian and other modes like an egg rolling off a mountain, so can only loosely assign it to blues.
04/11/2023, 18:46 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Stable audio uses a lot of the LAION audio dataset but for tags it uses a lot of the tags used in Audio Sparx (https://www.audiosparx.com/)
04/11/2023, 18:46 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Here is a sheet with a bunch of the tag information that Stable Audio contains which informs what prompting might work best

04/11/2023, 18:47 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Also, I heard from CJ at harmonAI that this kind of prompting also works - 
“Text prompt”|Instrument: Drums|FormatType: Solo
04/11/2023, 18:48 - +1 (857) 991-6423: so if you want solo instruments you can say "Instrument: Piano" at the end of your prompt, other tags like "Subgenre:"
04/11/2023, 19:15 - Sthit AI Group: This is gold. Thanks a lot!

06/11/2023, 09:48 - +91 94456 36004: Hey Folks!
good morning

Earlier last week, my team at Luma AI launched Genie, a new 3d foundation model in research preview capable of generating 3D models in seconds, highly useful for creatives to build amazing concepts / experiences without knowledge of any 3D modelling 

https://x.com/LumaLabsAI/status/1719792922646987152

Thought folks from this group would be interested in this, hence sharing (lmk if not), also if anyone has any feedback or comments or any feedback on UI/UX of the tool, viewer, etc. or anything feel free to reach out to me as it’s early preview. 

Available today on our Discord with just /genie <This message was edited>

06/11/2023, 17:10 - Hasan: Quite useful for creatives I feel.
06/11/2023, 17:21 - Vamshi: Reduce Disco and increase techno, was the ol’ recipe for diversity
06/11/2023, 17:21 - Vamshi: But the times they are a changing

06/11/2023, 17:22 - Vamshi: Things have come full circle since the 80s though, back to square one
06/11/2023, 17:27 - Vamshi: While we’re on the subject of diversity, there’s a lot of things that Indians claim to have been first at, which are actually incorrect in a hilarious way.

But there’s one that’s actually a real first that’s barely acknowledged, and that’s the experimental use of failed Roland products to pioneer a new age of acid, house and techno sounds by Charanjit Singh.

06/11/2023, 17:42 - Vamshi: @919334372044 already has a generative recipe for diversity
06/11/2023, 17:42 - Vamshi: Colour wise
06/11/2023, 17:52 - Nanditi: Had come across this a few years back, spent hours listening to all the tracks. Drew inspiration from these in my live-coded raga sets.

It's a good reminder, was feeling a bit stuck in the current one 😂  perhaps this is a sign to get me unstuck

10/11/2023, 14:32 - Divya Tak: I doubt there is a model that can give you without humnan guidance, because what you're hoping for is that character to move in a way that makes "sense". The model doesn't even know where the character is, let alone "move" it
10/11/2023, 14:32 - Divya Tak: you can rough out and use control net to generate keyframes
10/11/2023, 14:32 - Ambika: oh is it?

10/11/2023, 14:36 - Arpit Pilani: Yes, openpose should guide the pose, and style consistency controlnets for style

12/11/2023, 11:47 - +91 96194 91715: Oh seems to be a character from Tulsidas Ramcharitramanas. I’m not familiar with it
12/11/2023, 11:47 - +91 81784 02951: He's cosmic crow who met Lord Ram when Lord Ram was a toddler 
Lord instructed him to watch everything from a distance

After kalpas kakbhushundi got bored, since he saw Ramayana with same ending everytime
12/11/2023, 11:48 - +91 81784 02951: Here I meant he's going to be surprised if he saw Ayodhya in mars 😛

12/11/2023, 21:42 - +91 96507 49198: Also, Ram is more Krishna than ram, Dalle confused between multiple gods
12/11/2023, 21:47 - Prasad Crypt: Oooh. In reality hritik roshan has different number of fingers. So that explains the confusion of laxmans number of fingers 🫡

30/11/2023, 21:41 - Prasad Crypt: i think, as long as ai is catering human needs, its going to follow patterns. few days ago there was images creation for happy bunny, as the bunny got happier it still followed traditional stereotypes, became more and more god like so to speak. this limiting of ai in creative space is quite limiting for growth of ai. thanks for sharing tho, interesting 👍
30/11/2023, 21:45 - Hasan: Fair enough. I think the article is not focusing on the growth of AI in the creative space. This is talking about long term changes in the way we use technology itself and how that have been inspired in many cases by artist. Asking the question that If we take this perspective, can we use today’s artistic practices to get a glimpse of the future.

Even telling it to always speak in Hindi and not change the language in the prompt doesn’t work. It’s coming from whisper assuming I’m speaking in Urdu or chatgpt assuming I’m speaking Urdu since I had a few conversations in Urdu earlier? Is anyone else facing similar issues?

07/12/2023, 19:29 - +91 90228 45040: I see this as a great way to popularise less popular arts. I mean, I can have Optimus Prime doing Kathak and Bharatnatyam, if that doesnt pique my niece’s interest, nothing will.
07/12/2023, 19:29 - Ambika: But dataset?
07/12/2023, 19:34 - +91 90228 45040: I believe data set will emerge. If one is uploading anything on the interwebs, esp on socials , its all crawlable. I believe if a human is able to learn and copy by seeing it, so should an AI be able to. 

The debate of “I have not given consent for AI scraping, just uploaded for human eyes” will not work unless there is an amendment for AI Crawlers on something like Robots.txt which regulates Search Engine Crawlers.
07/12/2023, 19:36 - +91 90228 45040: I’ve been following the experiments on r/StableDiffusion, there’s interesting stuff that can be done using splitting video to  images, using img2img + Controlnet and then repackaging it as Video.

07/12/2023, 19:45 - +91 90228 45040: This is very less differentiable from something like Cocomelon or PinkFong (if you have kids, you know what I’m talking about)
07/12/2023, 19:46 - Prasad Crypt: but isnt it like ...erm...style transfer 🤔
07/12/2023, 19:46 - +91 90228 45040: Imagine the rich tales that we have, already done by AmarChitra Katha and likes, but which are not able to compete because the Kid doesnt fancy them, it removes that barrier. <This message was edited>
07/12/2023, 19:48 - +91 90228 45040: The Animation House that does the SuperCell kinda animation, should be able to create a Licensable model for their Art style, which the Content IP holder should be able to use.

07/12/2023, 20:09 - +91 90228 45040: It’s amazing how it can generate known IPs like Supergirl, as well as daily life renders like Football player, Office Conference call etc.
07/12/2023, 20:09 - +91 90228 45040: I assume reference images were given.
07/12/2023, 20:11 - +91 90228 45040: Data set can also emerge because things like Kinect can scan motion and generate wirframe models in motion, which can be input to these workflows. 

And that existed ages ago, there are depth sensors on all smartphones, I assume there’ll be handy 100$ cameras available for people to use on home tripods, as this kind of stuff becomes main stream.

I’m assuming the method is Take a dance video from tiktok, run skeleton tracking through media pipe on the next frame and generate the next frame through diffusion model. Use real next frame for reward function. This is really useful for many applications, specially for me in building interactive experiences.

11/12/2023, 00:24 - +91 90522 13427: Yea. Upload the image first into the midjourney discord server - then copy the image link - then /imagine and paste the link in after which type your prompt in, should take the image as source and give output accordingly.

11/12/2023, 11:19 - Prasad Crypt: Stochastic parrots 😝. I have a slightly different view. If an llm functions at same level as a 5 year old, then the llm is actually better than the 5 year old. Llm is functioning in isolation whereas the kid has assistance of other modalities (vision and other senses). So llm has a better foundational language based structure and would do better once other modalities get added.

13/12/2023, 18:53 - +1 (857) 991-6423: There are many resources for speaking voice (uberduck, audiobox from meta which is brand new).
For singing voice which I think you are asking, current best practice is to use timbre transfer on another audio performance (audio to audio). You can think of it as a voice filter and not a generation from just lyrics. Best method is Sovits SVC and RVC (both have githubs and colabs explaining how to train and do inference for free). There are also (not legal) singing voice models floating on discord and online. 
(https://github.com/svc-develop-team/so-vits-svc).
13/12/2023, 18:58 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Many (not so legal) companies work with these singing voice open source techniques by taking fees. (like voicify, lalals, voice-swap). A few (legal) companies do it with permission of the voice owners, as a new form of credit splits.
13/12/2023, 19:04 - Sthit AI Group: Does uberduck fall into the first category or second here ?
13/12/2023, 19:07 - Sthit AI Group: And what I am hearing is, this is a better approach:

1. Find a vocalist 
2. Get their permission
3. Build their voice model with them 
4. Add layer of AI artist collaboration
?
13/12/2023, 19:09 - Divya Tak: how are these AI vocals different from vocaloids

13/12/2023, 19:17 - +91 90228 45040: She had asked on her socials that use my voice and make songs, if I like them, I’ll endorse them, compile and even release as part of an album

13/12/2023, 19:29 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Vocaloids are equivalent to a very generic singing voice like the generic text to speech models (like old Siri voice). They have been popular for over a decade through virtual pop artists like Hatsune Miku.

The new singing voice cloning is able to generate more nuanced voices with timbre, articulation etc similar to unique voice identities (equivalent to the new wavenet based voices in Siri/Alexa).

Grimes, as a mainstream artist, did the voice sharing revenue idea. Which you can still try here (elf.tech). Many years ago Holly Herndon worked with yotam Mann and others to make a real time singing voice clone of her voice. Also released a DAO of her voice identity as Holly+ (there's a nice Ted talk demo by her). Now it's very easy to generate anyone's voice with only under 30 secs of there singing voice using SOVITS-SVC and RVC as I pointed.

Copying identity without permission is a violation of identity rights in almost every country in some form. Which is why many companies trying to make a product out of this voice cloning are only around for free weeks before they get enough law suits to put them out of business
13/12/2023, 19:33 - +91 90228 45040: I feel the era of 90’s pop will come back. I remember reading that Spice Girls and one of the Boyzone / Backstreet Boys were sort of manufactured Bands, and later there was a lot of AutoTune music. 

If not-so-famous Artists / local people can license their voice (like 1000s of Educators who license their videos on things like Skillshare etc) , then it gets processed via other AI tools, and that creates a steady outflux of Music at scale, catering to the wide variety of genres people have in mind, it will sort of create a music SPAM environment.
13/12/2023, 19:33 - +91 90228 45040: Now as we understand from Youtube, you either have 1 video with a million views or a million videos with 1 view, its all the same in the end.
13/12/2023, 19:33 - +91 90228 45040: AI will help generate the latter.
13/12/2023, 19:33 - +91 90228 45040: (in short term)
13/12/2023, 19:40 - +91 90228 45040: The change in user behaviour that I am seeing from my campus days (20 years ago) is also this, pardon my Anecdotal story to go side track 

In 99-2005, we had very little bandwidth, there used to be a coordinated Piracy group in campus so multiple people wont download the same thing. We also learnt how to bypass firewall, set up our own FTP servers , do SSH tunneling etc etc.. just to get some entertainment. 

We learnt a bunch about AVI codecs, how to resample the samevideo from MPEG to AVIs to save disc space etc etc. We also used to read a lot on IMDB and rotten tomatoes before downloading, as everything was precious. 


Then later, as all of this media was available, the later batches had all of this already downloaded in local disks, they moved to DC++ and became largely consumers. The number of downloaders became less and less. 

A few years back, when I went back to campus just after covid, the Pirated Copy servers are almost non existent. Everyone has a Mobile with 5G and bunch of streaming apps, there is no worry on quality or reading what is good. If there is nothing sensational like Game of Thrones or Breaking Bad, people just consume whatever their top 3 streaming apps keep serving them.

13/12/2023, 19:41 - +91 90228 45040: Largely, no one is putting in efforts to hunt for “Quality” as more and more content consumption has moved from “Pull interesting stuff” to “what is pushed” to me.
13/12/2023, 19:41 - Sthit AI Group: Alignment problem it seems 😂😂😂
13/12/2023, 19:43 - +91 90228 45040: The Data Driven Design for content has a large problem though. My parents feel that their generation is being un-served by the new streaming tech. 

Apart from a few things like “Panchayat” , there is hardly any new soft family entertainment being created.
13/12/2023, 19:44 - +91 90228 45040: They are going back to reboots of Wagle ki Dunia, and the continuing things of Tarak Mehta’s ulta chasma.
13/12/2023, 19:44 - Prasad Crypt: i dont know, i am more optimistic about ai capabilities. i dont think ai will continue doing just boilerplate music. it will do better music (including novelty) and then we will get into era of aesthetic fatigue. i already get that with ai visuals. things are so polished already in visual scene..i can only handle so much of it. too much is like being in disneyland 😬
13/12/2023, 19:45 - +91 90228 45040: I like that term, Aesthetic Fatigue
13/12/2023, 19:47 - +91 90228 45040: This is what we are suffering in UX industry. All the new entrants have embraced the slang of “UI UX design” and get inspired largely from what they see on Dribble and what’s selling on places like Themeforest. 

There’s a lot of Eye-Candy portfolios, with manufactured scenarios that I see in recruitment, and the fundamentals are often lacking.
13/12/2023, 19:47 - +91 90228 45040: with the amount of free UI kits available, its become sort of pointless to look at UI portfolio, I dive straight to UX questions in interview.
13/12/2023, 19:48 - +91 90228 45040: I’ll use the term *Aesthetic Fatigue* next time 🙂
13/12/2023, 19:48 - Sthit AI Group: Curious what do you ask ?
13/12/2023, 19:48 - +91 90228 45040: Lets do that on DMs, its out of scope for the current group 🙂
13/12/2023, 20:12 - +91 96202 12419: I used to end up with the perception that portfolios also meant little. Even in the first round, several designers used to end up giving such answers that it was difficult to believe
13/12/2023, 20:28 - +91 90228 45040: fully agree with the AI capabilities part. 

AI is like a Synthesizer, some people will be able to tune it and create wonderful Symphonies. 

Large population will be in Audience or  would play soulful Space music like Ross!

13/12/2023, 20:33 - Hasan: Music production is actually quite easy even today with modern DAWs and sample packs. What counts at the end of the day is a unique taste, artist working as a curator. I am waiting for AI model which can give musician  the amount of control that a modern music production software offers, which enables the musician to get out of the generic sound. There are some applications which are doing it like syncplant which given an audio clip can generate a musical instrument which can be tuned further manually. Text is not a great interface to work with music. Most of the production work is hearing and changing sound.
13/12/2023, 20:35 - Hasan: Also looking forward to real time AI generated voices which can be used to create real time interactive generative musical experiences. For example Letting a dancer control a singing voice with his body.
13/12/2023, 20:38 - Prasad Crypt: funny you say that. i was working on a hobby app during covid which senses motion using phone and feeds that as beats to jam with ai (like magenta). but like all covid things it just got forgotten from my memory 🙄

13/12/2023, 21:59 - +1 (929) 343-6065: First off thank you for such a detailed discussion 🙌🏼🙌🏼🙌🏼

To be very specific I was looking for exactly what you mention (the style transfer models or the new singing voice cloning with articulations and timbre which usually is the signature of given artists.)

It seems there’s a few tools out there that can help do this which is why I was curious if there is one that stands out. I saw lalals.com seems to be a popular one which offers a lot of artists but during my testing their entire ux was very buggy. Uberduck it seems was more suited for simple text to speech instead of vocal style transfer.

19/12/2023, 21:44 - +91 70928 62522: Can anybody suggest some interesting,innovative uses of generative ai/ or any technology for that matter for enhancing live musical performances?
19/12/2023, 21:57 - Divya Tak: @918890571387 @918971040239
19/12/2023, 22:27 - Hasan: @917092862522 real-time voice cloning can be used in various creative ways. I haven’t yet figured out voice cloning to Ableton input. 

I am experimenting with interactive generative audio reactive visuals. Using skeleton, hands, face and object tracking.
19/12/2023, 22:36 - +1 (857) 991-6423: In my PhD and artistic work we've been working in the context of live music performances and technology for a while. I can suggest looking at different aspects of live music

(1) the music itself - designing new musical interfaces, using tech in composition and performance frameworks like live coding, text to music samples, voice identity play (some references - dadabots, Holly Herndon), accompaniment (like Voyager by George Lewis as collaborator), robotic performers, complete digital performer (like Hatsune Miku)

(2) visuals: generative audio reactive visuals representing the music, representing individual instruments, singers, story elements

(3) audience: allowing audience to immerse in the liveness by having them participate in the generative music / visuals. Creating non-proscenium stages and speaker arrangements, voting, visualizing energy / movement of audience etc. / Streaming elements like contributing live comments, creating smaller sub groups for live and virtual audiences etc.

(4) pre or post live show experiences - like gamigication of elements of the live show, stories of the musicians etc.

This is a small sample of possibilities. New tech is often first used to mimic existing ideas before it can be used to imagine previously impossible ideas and build new contexts to support it.
19/12/2023, 23:24 - Hasan: Great pointers, exploring the musical latent spaces in a live performance and mixing it together would be so much fun.
20/12/2023, 01:22 - Vamshi: I’m very optimistic about unreal engine pipelines integrated with generative tools.

Even on its own, unreal engine really spoils you with its virtual production and “broadcast” sample projects, which are a great starting point for very engaging and stunning results.

Pipeline and plugins are still weak from Gen AI into unreal engine, but there’s a big opportunity there.

Luma AI has a plug-in of course. Karan from luma is on this group.
20/12/2023, 01:24 - Vamshi: The poster child for very successful live performances with unreal has been the artist Anyma, who has made it a signature element of his live shows that have been received very well by festival and and large club audiences.
20/12/2023, 01:24 - Vamshi: Worth checking out for ideas!
20/12/2023, 01:25 - Vamshi: https://youtu.be/MQCcL9FV-aI
20/12/2023, 01:26 - Vamshi: Combined with pro level integration with DMX control, stage lighting protocols and full pre-vis sample projects, it’s gateway to the real deal!
20/12/2023, 01:27 - +1 (929) 343-6065: They work directly with a 3D artist. They currently dont use any gen AI as far as I have researched. Also if anyone is interested in concert visuals / knows designer folks please link me up! (Melodic techno/ deep house + indo visuals is what I’m specifically interested in)
20/12/2023, 01:34 - Vamshi: That’s correct, Gen AI link is a big opportunity here, but the pipeline is well positioned for production.

I’m definitely interested in this aspect, and it’s a core focus area for me.

As soon as I’m done drowning in the saw dust from the studio bring up, I hope to get back to the unreal engine part of the experiment, will definitely reach out, @19293436065, @917092862522 and @18579916423.

I’m already connected to Hasan and kinda get his vibe (Goa meet overdue, @918890571387✋)
20/12/2023, 01:38 - +1 (929) 343-6065: Yes I agree. Massive op here, unfortunately all my efforts using gen ai in this space has led to sub par visuals that’s just not up to these guys’ quality. 

For context, I produce techno (specifically trying to bring more south Asian sounds to modern techno).
20/12/2023, 01:41 - Vamshi: I think using the Gen AI tools to create initial assets and then hand crafting it into the 3D workflow is a bit more satisfying.

Nice to know about the techno production side of it! Will DM, this makes for a great connect!
20/12/2023, 01:43 - +1 (929) 343-6065: Yes this I’ve successfully gotten good results with.

They will need to figure out their business models (contracts with catalog owners) before they can make any announcements
21/12/2023, 21:25 - Vamshi: Interesting. I guess they’ll see if it goes viral and then if it does, it will be easier to afford damage control ? 😅

21/12/2023, 21:26 - Vamshi: Not really a demo, this is running live, and you don’t even have to wait much !
21/12/2023, 21:31 - Vamshi: Looks like they’re partnered or have some support from Microsoft - because it’s also now integrated into Microsoft Copilot

22/12/2023, 19:06 - +91 90228 45040: Suno just helped me made my friend’s day. My friend Deepti is a newbie writer, she writes poetry on FB. 

I surprised her with a Suno,ai rendition of her poem, and her happiness level is off the charts.
22/12/2023, 19:06 - +91 90228 45040: Bringing happiness to aam-aadmi is where I see the potential.

22/12/2023, 19:07 - +91 90228 45040: It also gave a very different Vocal rendition, which totally changes the mood.

22/12/2023, 19:08 - +91 90228 45040: @919008752566 , I’d suggest you pass lyrics in Hindi, rather than transliteration english
22/12/2023, 19:08 - +91 90228 45040: it’ll give better results.
22/12/2023, 19:09 - +91 90228 45040: This experiment was totally inspired by what you shared yesterday
22/12/2023, 19:09 - +91 90228 45040: My thanks
22/12/2023, 19:27 - Prasad Crypt: fun to play with. i took the liberty to use lyrics and try something - https://app.suno.ai/song/284339e6-9a2a-40cd-81a2-94bdaa9deb83/
22/12/2023, 19:30 - +91 90228 45040: Noice! Somehow it fit everything in 1.2 min, I love it, will forward!
22/12/2023, 19:35 - +91 90087 52566: Yes for “krishna ki chetavni “ i passed lyrics in hindi , it gave better results :)
22/12/2023, 19:37 - +91 90087 52566: I see lot of potentials specially for regional language literature poetry… people are reading less regional languages .. thia way it can be popularised.
22/12/2023, 19:39 - +91 90228 45040: Yeah, I have friends who prefer Audibles to Kindle/IRL Books
22/12/2023, 19:42 - Prasad Crypt: If you give commas and periods correctly you can control the flow better. Otherwise it's just doing what it can 😌
22/12/2023, 19:42 - +91 90228 45040: I’ll go through the docs, I just did copy pasta and hit run… super happy with the results.

23/12/2023, 23:21 - +91 90087 52566: I have tested gpt4 and created assistant for transcribing handwritten notes .. and tested on different historical letters. it works really well for english. But it does not work at all for any other scripts.

Thanks @18579916423 for sharing about this!
26/12/2023, 21:25 - Nanditi: Yup yup. Doing a talk on code & classical music. Some other great talks also from people you all might know. Hope to see some of you there 🫶🏼
26/12/2023, 21:43 - +91 77048 92000: Also there is a Noise concert and an Algorave around the same time on the 6th and 7th of Jan. Details coming very soon.

27/12/2023, 13:13 - +91 78914 00903: Hi all, are there any good online courses on game design? I'd prefer pure game design courses without coding
27/12/2023, 13:32 - Divya Tak: GDC is the best resouce
27/12/2023, 13:32 - Divya Tak: Rather than courses I usually like to watch different lectures for things that I'm learning
27/12/2023, 13:32 - Divya Tak: Like recently I've been on a narrative design sorta path
27/12/2023, 13:32 - Divya Tak: And there are so many amazing talks
27/12/2023, 13:33 - Divya Tak: There is a course on master class but like I donno how much practical knowledge you'll get
27/12/2023, 13:34 - Divya Tak: If you want to do without coding, you might wanna search for board game lectures and courses on yt, because that's much more mechanics and balance focused without getting into coding
27/12/2023, 14:16 - +91 90228 45040: +1 to this, for Online Gaming.
27/12/2023, 14:16 - Divya Tak: Honestly for all of gaming
27/12/2023, 14:20 - +91 90228 45040: If you do decide to go the Boardgame Route, welcome to Boardgames, a great developing hobby in India, esp post-Pandaemic. 

We’ve had now 4(5?) Kickstarters out of India, 3 MeepleCons, TTOX coming up in January, and pan-India WA groups on everything from Designing boardgames, Publishing them, Rules Overview and Playtesting, City wide Meetups and a thriving 2nd hand Market. 

Several crossovers are happening, with great Boardgames transitioning to Digital media on STEAM / BGA, and popular VG IPs coming to Boardgames (STALKER, God of War, Metal Gear Solid, Street fighter) etc, exciting times. 
Can send links which
27/12/2023, 14:22 - +91 90228 45040: I would beg to differ on this, for Boardgames, GDC is unheard of.  Video Gaming is often Real time, a matter of skill , network connection and Hardware. 

Boardgaming is primarily turn based. We have a different set of Books / Encyclopedia of Mechanisms/ Award functions and Conferences which are different from the VG scene.
27/12/2023, 14:23 - +91 90228 45040: The primary theory is same : It should be Fun 🙂
27/12/2023, 14:23 - Divya Tak: There are a lot of talks on board game making in gdc
27/12/2023, 14:23 - Divya Tak: They are quite good as well. Everything from mechanics, to narrative creation to marketing
27/12/2023, 14:25 - Divya Tak: If you're okay with unstructured learning then gmtk and ai and games are both good channels
27/12/2023, 14:25 - Divya Tak: This is ofcourse older meaning of ai and not gen ai though he is discussing gen ai too

27/12/2023, 14:32 - +91 90228 45040: BGG pinned post in GameDesign Forums are a great resource.

27/12/2023, 14:33 - +91 90228 45040: And a good way to practice, is to take part in open contests, my favorite are the 18 card challenge and Roll and Write ones.

27/12/2023, 14:33 - +91 90228 45040: You’ll get tonnes of user feedback

27/12/2023, 14:53 - +91 78914 00903: I'm talking more about multi-player online games with modern AAA graphics. But I do understand that game design fundamentally applies to that as well, but I would prefer if the content covers that area as well
27/12/2023, 14:53 - +91 78914 00903: Sure. Thanks 😊
27/12/2023, 14:59 - Divya Tak: Gdc has many vids for it

27/12/2023, 17:32 - +91 90228 45040: Stuff like this would be great to do Market sentiment Test of products before launching

02/01/2024, 16:58 - +91 81440 25596: Any particularly useful articles or resources you've come across to read up and learn more from? Curious to know what's in store
02/01/2024, 17:08 - Hasan: Looking forward to working with real-time models. Finally LLMs and video generation models are reaching real-time capabilities which will enable new class of real-time applications specially in the domain of interactive experiences. Also open source  multimodals which combines text, audio and visual together or modular foundation models which can be used together.
02/01/2024, 17:20 - Divya Tak: Honestly just picking up and using things by doing live research when I have a specific need. I don't have much theoretical basis in both ai and VFX, it's all need based for me.

03/01/2024, 14:05 - Prasad Crypt: When I was a kid, I used to visit my grandpa's old house. In the living room there were these old photographs of people. Some photos posed and stylistic, some still life with people doing ordinary things. They added to the ambience and character of the place. When I used to look at the photos, I used to wonder, about the real life of people in the photos, they must be somewhere, doing something right now, or what was their life like. There was a sense of grandiosity, of hope, that something concrete, something real, something good, exists.

Now I see a good photo and first I think, is this person even real 😝

05/01/2024, 14:58 - Divya Tak: That looks cool, can you share a bit more about what was the brief? and how you aligned it with the workflow?
05/01/2024, 15:13 - +91 75075 15333: I don't use AI until and unless i can make it completely invisible/irrelevant to the output or have it be a part of the execution in a way that it makes sense. Here it did, as the brand was open to looking at ideas that could easily be explored with AI
05/01/2024, 15:14 - Divya Tak: Ooh say more? Like what makes an idea more conducive to exploration with ai
05/01/2024, 15:15 - Harsha Dashtoon: Why not use a plug-in like scaler?
05/01/2024, 15:19 - +91 75075 15333: Here it was literally talking about a world where there's little to no difference between being a human and a machine, a future of partying, a lot of sci fi inspirations
05/01/2024, 15:28 - Divya Tak: ah so like the scifi and lack of specificity in the people?
05/01/2024, 15:31 - +91 75075 15333: I like talking about tech through tech, i don't think I'd want to use AI for work that requires a little more sensitivity

08/01/2024, 12:17 - +91 90228 45040: As a scifi geek, I would still not have/want this. 

I like my AI omni-present, a big brother, always listening, always watching (Some may think its like the Entity in latest Mission Impossible), I am thinking more like The Caves of Steel from Isaac Asimov (Even before “Her”) 

Then I’d like the AI to have Drones/Robots/Androids working for it to give it mobility and do all the things its meant for / capable of, etc. 

At present, this is an in-between step, where the physical representation is not as much of an Value add as its mean to be. 

I’d be ok seeing it at an Airport or a Mall as a Curio object to interact with for short time, not for anything meaning ful.
08/01/2024, 12:18 - +91 90228 45040: I realize that its a Catch 22 situation, it needs all those interactions to get better, but yeah, not at Home (esp in India where real estate is at a premium )
08/01/2024, 12:19 - +91 96507 49198: As a user I don't really need a robotic face , 

a mic to speak into and for the machine a speaker or a display screen would be good enough to communicate back,

Or the face and the body should pass the turing test, that it seems so real that it's difficult to differentiate whether it's a robot or a real human
08/01/2024, 12:30 - +91 99102 70434: I might be wrong but This looks like a gimmick to me .. Like a kiosk on steroid
08/01/2024, 12:31 - +65 9069 0114: Quick question: character consistency in Dalle was possible. Is it possible in SD (without using dreambooth?). Things are evolving fast and I might have missed it

Isn’t that already on the release roadmap for some companies?

15/01/2024, 17:45 - +91 77048 92000: It’s a magical realism comedy with lots of conversations around relationships. There is a gender less being that takes over the life of a somewhat happily married couple and really complicates their lives.

Please share if you’ll have any ways to light up some conversations online with the objective of getting people’s attention for the movie / screenings. Zero budget ideas / use some good friends in our networks to amplify it.

21/01/2024, 07:34 - Prasad Crypt: Johny johny yes papa in classical style. Has anyone tried suno in classical style?
21/01/2024, 10:02 - Hasan: It doesn’t work well indian classical music. Some random output but not even close. Guessing it’s the lack of training data.
21/01/2024, 10:27 - Hasan: They are quite good. There is another singer who does this style. I have shared this with a few friends from classical music and they don’t like this. Personally I am all for experimentations. It’s uncomfortable because the form is supposed to be “pure” and “sacred”. Also heard the argument that it can be done well but this is not doing fusion well, honestly all experiments starts somewhere. https://youtu.be/N00R-mhB3oQ?si=r2qqKJvh3oDQznCv
21/01/2024, 11:02 - Prasad Crypt: haha classic tradition debate. there is lot of superstition in the field. i have tried telling people why there were 22 shrutis and why modern music should go to 24 or that except for certain keys using harmonium for singing reference is mathematically inaccurate. but people dont listen 😬. sorry the rant is off AI topic

21/01/2024, 12:39 - Prasad Crypt: these are two topics. so you are asking about 22 shrutis thing or harmonium
21/01/2024, 12:40 - Divya Tak: What's a Shruti?
21/01/2024, 12:44 - Prasad Crypt: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeTvUQzeg7g

she explains pretty well
21/01/2024, 12:47 - Divya Tak: Huh. Weird(?)/interesting (?)
21/01/2024, 12:48 - Divya Tak: So is all Indian classical like this
21/01/2024, 12:48 - Divya Tak: Hindustani/carnatic
21/01/2024, 12:59 - Prasad Crypt: there are differences of opinion. if you listen to some experts, like kishori amonkar, or ajoy chakraborti, they are pretty open, they say ragas are not bound by rules and singer has flexibility, while some other are totally rule based. there are certain guidelines, like classical believes in contrast and clarity so to get contrast we have area between shrutis where you should not sing, so listener has no confusion on what is being sung etc. my personal opinion based on what i have read is it was pretty open and lot of hard rules came later. 22 shuritis came from practice of using tanpura in classical concerts. tanpura is tuned to frequency of sa and pa notes. if singer does variation around these two notes, it causes acoustic beats and its uncomfortable to ear. so sa and pa shrutis were banned and one can only sing pure notes. modern singers recording doesnt have tanpura so this is obsolete problem and we should have 24 shrutis but .. tradition
21/01/2024, 13:07 - Divya Tak: Interesting
21/01/2024, 13:08 - Divya Tak: And these are ranges so they could very well be all treated as such, no point in start and mid point to be fixed?

21/01/2024, 13:10 - Prasad Crypt: we need reference..because very few people have absolute pitch sensing ability. at the same time it doesnt have to be always sung. there are thngs like missing fundamental which brain can perceive. brain is quite at these things

21/01/2024, 13:11 - +1 (857) 991-6423: I don't understand the case for 24, Could you share what you mean? Traditional Microtonal musical cultures like makam music have much more than 24 possible octave divisions and modern microtonal traditions have 32tet and beyond
21/01/2024, 13:15 - Prasad Crypt: you are right. there is no reason to limit to 22 or 24. its analog space. even classical people say that, like if you hear kishori amonkar interviews, she has said the vocal space is continous so there is flexibility.  in context of traditional hindustani classical, there are 22, and in that context there should be 24 instead. otherwise it doesnt matter, we can sing anything. lot of - what note feels right is ear training based on what we have heard since childhood
21/01/2024, 13:55 - Divya Tak: Hmmm
21/01/2024, 13:56 - Divya Tak: Are there musical traditions that would seem completely disharmonius to our ears? (Assuming we feel okya with Indian and western
21/01/2024, 14:01 - Prasad Crypt: sure at composition level it would, cause there is connection between music and language comprehension, even for instrumental music or classical with no words. the farther you are from your proto language tree, the weirder it would become, say for example chinese music for an indian. modern times are difficult, since due to internet everyone has influence from everywhere.
21/01/2024, 14:02 - Sthit AI Group: Don't know about  a tradition as such, but, this comes close in terms of using traditional disharmony as a form of music:

21/01/2024, 14:10 - Hasan: Does noise music counts?
21/01/2024, 14:11 - Divya Tak: I guess so
21/01/2024, 14:12 - Divya Tak: Music is weird
21/01/2024, 14:12 - Divya Tak: 😂😂😂
21/01/2024, 14:32 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Music is everything from a lullaby to using sound as construction material. It seems it's a way to study language, culture, politics and more. Thank you for my Ted tik tok talk
21/01/2024, 14:48 - Hasan: <Media omitted>
21/01/2024, 15:09 - Hasan: I have heard him in a program he mentioned that In the dhrupad tradition they consider it a spectrum so essentially infinite Shrutis. The major difference was created with the reference used for these traditions. In dhrupad tanpura and Rudra Veena is used which are both string based instruments. String based instruments can glide from one note to another in a smooth curve. While in hindustani classical the use of harmonium needs a limited standard to be set since it’s a key based instrument.
21/01/2024, 15:31 - Divya Tak: Interesting. But tanpura is single note too right
21/01/2024, 15:33 - Hasan: The wires can be tuned however you want. It’s an art to tune the tanpura itself.
21/01/2024, 15:34 - Divya Tak: Ah I see
21/01/2024, 15:36 - Hasan: https://ragajunglism.org/ragas/tanpuras/ this is one of the best resources I have found about tanpura.
21/01/2024, 15:38 - Sthit AI Group: This is amazing. Thanks for sharing
21/01/2024, 15:38 - Vamshi: The reverse interpretation is considered “bonafide”, by now, thanks to Carnatic artists like Madurai Mani Iyer, who’s famous for doing western classical type compositions in Carnatic style
21/01/2024, 15:38 - Vamshi: https://youtu.be/QobvMZELj0k
21/01/2024, 15:40 - Vamshi: Of course every such conversation has to eventually lead to John Cages 4’33’’
21/01/2024, 15:40 - Vamshi: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/4′33″
21/01/2024, 15:41 - Vamshi: Basically nothing for the entire duration
21/01/2024, 15:41 - Vamshi: 😅, but you need to follow the score
21/01/2024, 15:43 - Sthit AI Group: I guess a good way to gauge how a person group or system interprets nothing? 😅
21/01/2024, 15:44 - Vamshi: Maybe it’s incorrect to say his intention was nothing, because it explicitly says the idea is to make the person aware of the environment. 

It would be interesting to do the same in an anechoic chamber
21/01/2024, 15:45 - +91 70928 62522: This composition is truly the epitome of subtlety
21/01/2024, 15:45 - Vamshi: Anyone who’s sat in an anechoic chamber will be able to relate, it’s either profound or scary after 10 minutes or so
21/01/2024, 15:46 - Sthit AI Group: Pretty sure I picked this word up from the overall convos in this or related genAI group, but I guess 

The Umwelt? 😅
21/01/2024, 15:49 - Prasad Crypt: isnt that myth? i remember veritasium guy sat in one and came out and said - meh, i am fine
21/01/2024, 15:50 - Sthit AI Group: That's a sample size of one 😅
21/01/2024, 15:51 - Prasad Crypt: one who makes claim, the onus of proving it is on him 🫡
21/01/2024, 15:51 - Sthit AI Group: Aligned, hence making no claims 😂
21/01/2024, 15:51 - Vamshi: In my own experience, I did a full u-turn from someone who was scandalised by the noise music from music concréte (Pierre Schaefer , Francis Dhomont, Edgar Varese), as some kind of social engineering to get people to believe anything about music, to absolutely loving it as a bonafide art form and sonic experience several years later.
21/01/2024, 15:52 - Vamshi: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Musique_concrète
21/01/2024, 15:56 - Vamshi: Similar to variation in reactions when people get an MRI scan 😄
21/01/2024, 15:57 - Divya Tak: I've been thinking of doing a sensory deprivation chamber visit for similar reasons
21/01/2024, 15:58 - Divya Tak: Not related to music but in our day to day, we have such a barrage of signal and noise, it would be interesting to see what "nothing" feels like
21/01/2024, 15:59 - Prasad Crypt: we have one in bangalore 🤨
21/01/2024, 15:59 - Vamshi: Suddenly the inside of your head gets really loud 😄
21/01/2024, 15:59 - Divya Tak: Yes
21/01/2024, 15:59 - Divya Tak: Hsr
21/01/2024, 15:59 - Vamshi: This will be the location for the creatives meetup now
21/01/2024, 15:59 - Prasad Crypt: its called tinnitus. probably that infection you had as a child 🙄
21/01/2024, 16:00 - Vamshi: Start with a full calibration
21/01/2024, 16:01 - Prasad Crypt: N=1 but i find exercise easier while wearing noise cancelling headphones and not listening to music
21/01/2024, 16:02 - Sthit AI Group: Makes sense actually. Mind body connection during exercise is a thing.
21/01/2024, 16:02 - +91 99102 70434: I can't be the onlyone to read it Utsav Somani ..
21/01/2024, 16:07 - Vamshi: Had to look it up 😅
21/01/2024, 16:11 - Prasad Crypt: sensory deprivation tank prank would be nice. get people in, make whispering sounds
21/01/2024, 18:49 - Divya Tak: So question for all the amaizng music trained and knowledgeable people, why do they keep singing same line over and over again in Indian classical
21/01/2024, 18:50 - Divya Tak: For the whole duration
21/01/2024, 18:57 - Hasan: Not a trained and knowledgeable person but 

In the pure classical form lyrics are not as important. A lot of the composition doesn’t even have lyrics, it can be in sur (sa,re,ga) or Aakar which is just voice like alaap. There is a structure to the to it. Usually starting with a slow pace which sets the stage for the composition, it presents the basic structure of the composition and then moving forward it adds improvisation on the basic structure of notes, usually ending with high energy but that changes based on the raag as well. The point of singing the same line is to show variations and improvisations within the rules of the raag. There a great lecture about it, Let me see if I can find it.
21/01/2024, 19:05 - Hasan: https://youtu.be/ogKOYaArTFw still looking for that lecture but this performance is a good example. She sings hardly 4-6 lines during the 14 minutes but every time the line repeats it’s a different melody.
21/01/2024, 19:19 - Hasan: https://youtu.be/6zEyCPW4lYE this talks about what is happening during the repetition. Could be a little technical but you’ll get an idea.
21/01/2024, 20:23 - Divya Tak: Thankss!
21/01/2024, 20:31 - Divya Tak: Today has been so educational
21/01/2024, 20:31 - Divya Tak: And after all the information about Indian classical I saw a performance also today
21/01/2024, 20:43 - Prasad Crypt: Just to add, classical, especially vilambit styles, are a lot about ambiance building. You go somewhere mentally and then the space expands. It's like a fractal.
It's quite a unusual thing compared to general music
21/01/2024, 20:45 - Prasad Crypt: She is one of the best in modern times. For vocal practice, one she said, for practicing sa, one has to sing ha, like it has to come from chest and not from throat. Simple things but you hear it from really the most wise people 😅
21/01/2024, 21:12 - Nanditi: Actually it has to come from the stomach 🙈
21/01/2024, 21:13 - Prasad Crypt: yes, like the second diaphragh at the pelvic floor. 
but didnt want to intimidate the folk here 😬
21/01/2024, 23:22 - Divya Tak: Diaphragm breathing isn't a foreign or scary concept

22/01/2024, 16:59 - Vamshi: Only scary when someone can shatter glasses
22/01/2024, 17:20 - Heer Shingala: Hi all, who does the best tool deep dives in the business? Looking for inspiration.
22/01/2024, 17:23 - +91 77048 92000: Again not coming from a classically trained position

But the general idea is to set a baseline. Hindustani and Carnatic are improvised styles, so you set the baseline, veer as far away from it as your skills allow and then bring it back.
22/01/2024, 17:27 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Sankalp gulati 's PhD work on computational melodies of Indian art music and Kaustuv Kanti Ganguli's PhD are excellent resources for understanding melodies in hindustani and carnatic music from a modern statistical approach

22/01/2024, 19:32 - Divya Tak: lol
22/01/2024, 19:32 - Divya Tak: no the conversation doesn't need to about AI only
22/01/2024, 19:33 - Divya Tak: just talking about AI would be accepting defeat :P
22/01/2024, 19:33 - Divya Tak: the fact that we have broad scale conversations about creative domains is what my and @919008639111 's initial impetus for making the group was

ok then. forwarding from creative coding group. last bits of creative animations remaining humans have still been doing 😝

23/01/2024, 09:28 - +91 88080 32969: Here i have used musicgen stero with same prompt and different duration. Longer the audio it loses rythm sometimes.

23/01/2024, 09:45 - +91 77048 92000: You mean what am I using for inference? It is an implementation in Max/MSP using a third party object called nn~ made by the same team that made RAVE at IRCAM

The models themselves are trained on a hours few hours of audio datasets from my sample libraries.
23/01/2024, 09:50 - Prasad Crypt: Cool experiment. Btw I have heard that if you scream into the void for too long, after a while the void screams back at you 🏋️‍♀️
23/01/2024, 09:53 - +91 77048 92000: Thanks so much!

I did exactly that for a performance at NOISEOISEOISE in Goa. At first I screamed into the RAVE model and then I used the feedback from the speakers to drive the modulation while exploring the latent space of the model with pose estimation 😋 <This message was edited>

24/01/2024, 20:25 - +91 70928 62522: I would still like them to share information regarding the tools in non technical terms
24/01/2024, 20:26 - Ambika: Doable
24/01/2024, 20:26 - Ambika: It would be ideal if shared in context of the work.  Eg what @917704892000 was talking about with his pose estimation music piece
24/01/2024, 20:28 - Ambika: You can frame your questions in that context perhaps that would help.
24/01/2024, 20:29 - +91 90228 45040: Looks good! 

I’m a lot into Comics, I grew up reading Raj / Manoj / Tulsi / Diamond / Chunnu / Indrajal Comics and picked up Archies / Tintin / Calvin in College, and then the fascinating world of WebComics in XKCD / Manga / Manhwa online. 

*Unsolicited UX Suggestion:* While you guys do progress on the Creation part, the consumption part (even subscription based) is now largely standerdized. 

Here’s What I missed while reading a few of your comics: 
- No Title as Episode begins. 
- ⁠No summary/last frame of Previous episode 
- ⁠No Back to Top at bottom 
- ⁠No Episode tracker / Prev<>Next at Bottom (if Back to top isnt there ) 
- ⁠No Comments to give feedback to the Creator or Thumbs or Number of Likes / Views (which shows popularity) , No publish date / publish schedule (to know when next episode is expected, or where to sign for notifications) 

All these are reader side experiences which can be just imitated from other Manga/Manhwa/ Webcomic sites, and will greatly improve consumption. 

I’ll give creation a go over the weekend and get back.
24/01/2024, 21:04 - +91 81590 63404: Thx man
24/01/2024, 21:04 - +91 81590 63404: We have a lot of these points already on the roadmap and will share the rest with the team
24/01/2024, 21:05 - +91 81590 63404: But this is much appreciated - thx again … would also love similar feedback for the creator platform!
24/01/2024, 21:07 - +91 90228 45040: Oh forgot: 
- On 1st Episode, the “Prev” is still active as a link and doesnt lead anywhere, should be greyed out. 
- ⁠On last in series, when clicking on “Next” , it leads to a Page not found errror, shoul lead to “Will be Published soon” if you want a page, or grey it out.
24/01/2024, 21:34 - Soumyadeep: Wow thanks a lot @919022845040

27/01/2024, 19:14 - Ambika: @919953076613 I’ll post it in the creative coding group
27/01/2024, 19:14 - Ambika: Or wait
27/01/2024, 19:14 - Ambika: You can
27/01/2024, 19:14 - Divya Tak: Sure!
27/01/2024, 19:14 - Ambika: You are on that group 😂😂
27/01/2024, 19:17 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Yes! Because of their novel masked token construction and scoring with a pretrained ranker, they seem to produce faster text to audio then the tokenized audio regressive models audioLDM and musicGen. Alexandre Defossez is the person to watch, he is on all these papers. They provide APIs just like their musicGen models so worth testing it out ourselves!

Tldr; check this out

27/01/2024, 19:19 - +91 88080 32969: Intried out MAGNeT. Focus is on faster output and quality is not that good in comparison to musicgen stereo. Musicgen is used as a rescoring model here.

31/01/2024, 15:39 - +91 83768 46196: Yeah I forgot the name of the act but this was it. Elsewhere in India. Is this generative at all?

quick rundown: cgi renders of each scene was processed in stable diffusion, followed by numerous rounds of editing and compositing performed by our talented team. AI was used as a creative tool throughout the production. We will share more BTS and additional insights at a later date.”
01/02/2024, 09:16 - Ambika: Well deserved 🙌
01/02/2024, 09:40 - Hasan: Thank you so much. I can’t believe how much love and support this art work have received. I want it expand this magical AI village with more objects and I will try my best to make it an open community project where other artist can come in and contribute. The goal of Bhaav-nagari  is to make AI as accessible as possible for the people in the small villages. The next iteration will be an exhibition + workshop, hopefully reducing the power gap between the users and non users of AI. ✨

03/02/2024, 10:47 - +91 98661 84229: Sure

I am leading the text and vision intelligence projects at Straive. Build lot of solutions using Analytics, AI and GenAI largely in ESG, Books, Forms and more. As a personal effort, I actively mentor 100’s of students from communities (being guest speaker at Woxen, IMT, ISB, Upgrad, Bits-Pilani and multiple corporates)

Being Alumni from ISB in Analytics from 2017-18, teaching and mentoring takes around 60% of my day

I am looking forward to build solutions at an intersection of songs + lyrics + GenAI 

Any helping hands are appreciated

05/02/2024, 10:02 - Hasan: I am cooking up something with @917704892000 and @919052087382 , a musical Jugalbandi of humans and machines in Hindustani classical framework.  No promises yet but it might be ready in the first half of March.

05/02/2024, 10:35 - Hasan: Spot on. Line from the concept note.

Inspired by the concept of cyborg chess, where a human and a machine play the game together as a team, Generative Jugalbandi aims to create a musical dialogue between the human performers and the machine-generated sounds.

As a tool, as a human like, as a super being, or the front like a wizard of Oz / or lil miquela

If this isn’t allowed, then we’d need to form another group with you 😂
05/02/2024, 20:41 - Prasad Crypt: No but its interesting discussion! I for one, want to follow the stories, where the last remaining creative humans are fighting the losing battle with our AI overlords who are taking over the creative industry 😛
05/02/2024, 21:58 - Divya Tak: ofcourse this is precisely the kind of conversations we wanna have!
05/02/2024, 23:39 - Nitin | SuperMinions.com: Amazing. More Power to you. I was playing around with Facebook LLMs for Music/SFX generation last quarter and gave Indian classical a go. The performance on indian classical instruments were so meh...
05/02/2024, 23:40 - Nitin | SuperMinions.com: Haha. Agree!
05/02/2024, 23:49 - Hasan: Yeah my experience have been the same. That’s why we are not using any text to sound models here. We are trying to make it so it’s realtime human collaboration, specifically @919052087382  composing the Raag based melodies in code and machines role is to create variations within the rule of the Raga around the composition. 
@917704892000 using live coding and skeleton tracking models to control parameters for percussions. Honestly I don’t understand many parts of there setup, so ask them directly if you have any questions. Text to music generation is not there yet specially in Indian classical.
06/02/2024, 13:31 - +91 75075 15333: Speaking in Trivandrum coming  weekend, in case anyone is around!

Also wondering how to bring in the conversation about AI at a literature fest 🤔
06/02/2024, 13:33 - +91 70928 62522: Would love to know the tech stack more in detail!
06/02/2024, 13:40 - Prasad Crypt: Maybe a demo of how to write a (mediocre) novel using chatgpt 😅. People like criticizing mediocre stuff, especially book reading folks
06/02/2024, 13:48 - Sthit AI Group: Ice Cold 😂
06/02/2024, 13:50 - +91 75075 15333: Maybe i make a novel overnight and show up with it just to feel like I fit in
06/02/2024, 13:55 - +91 99402 37330: Hey folks. 
I'm conducting a seminar on utilizing AI for marketing to small business owners. 

Would love to know some actionable and working tools I can recco to them. 

Areas I personally feel that can be mentioned : 
- Content Creation (canva, SD, MJ, DallE) (RunwayML, invideo) (Bard, CGPT - writing) I Know I'm missing out a few tools/names. Pls enlighten me 
- Ad scheduling
- Newsletter/Community building
- 

Would love top hear more and don't mind sharing the poster if it's allowed and can help interested folks to join too 🙌
06/02/2024, 13:56 - +91 99402 37330: Also, I'm in Bangalore today. Attending the CoPilot event by Together aimed at showcasing AI-Based products. Would love to meet up if someone from here is around ^.^
06/02/2024, 14:20 - +91 96507 49198: Give people 3 different paragraphs to read, ask which one is written by AI
06/02/2024, 14:39 - Divya Tak: Strategy/ brainstorming etc using AI
06/02/2024, 14:39 - Divya Tak: like rather than thinking about just the execution part of pipeline, you can also think about the  concept + planning + pre production phases
06/02/2024, 14:40 - Divya Tak: damn @918763968157 you're bringing folks in from outside also :D
06/02/2024, 14:42 - Pratyush Choudhury: Hard work 🙏🏼
06/02/2024, 14:42 - Divya Tak: how controversial do you want to be :P
06/02/2024, 14:42 - Divya Tak: inspiring
06/02/2024, 14:45 - +91 75075 15333: My mere presence might be offensive to some haha 😂
Tbh invoking curiosity is all I aim to do
06/02/2024, 14:46 - Divya Tak: you can talk about all of the different things that AI can do
06/02/2024, 14:46 - Divya Tak: i think a lot of the focus tends to be on "it will do the writing"
06/02/2024, 14:46 - Divya Tak: but if you can use it as an assist on to other things, that might make folks curious
06/02/2024, 14:47 - Divya Tak: like i used it to help me edit poetry, by giving me thematic suggestion
06/02/2024, 14:49 - +91 75075 15333: Yeah a lot of my practice revolves around the "Why" of AI rather than the "How" of it
06/02/2024, 14:49 - Divya Tak: elaborate more?
06/02/2024, 14:51 - +91 75075 15333: Not focusing so much on how to do things with AI, but why to
06/02/2024, 14:52 - +91 75075 15333: Also just how it changes the narrative of our times
Exploring the questions that arise with what the AI can or can not do, how it would affect the way we see the world and the way we create or consume information
06/02/2024, 14:53 - +91 81784 02951: Any examples of talking points? I'd love to suggest one discussed here: https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.adi1374
06/02/2024, 14:55 - +91 81784 02951: What they've done is, used CLIP's arch which is contrastive learning over text and images. The text data comes from whatever they talk to the baby and the image data comes from whatever baby sees, i.e from the camera stranded over baby.

The end result is that classfications learnt by CVCL (that's what they call it) and the lessons learnt by baby are similar
06/02/2024, 14:55 - +91 81784 02951: How I read it is that transformers are not more data hungry than us

09/02/2024, 13:08 - Hasan: @919982084784 Sweet. This is beautiful. I have developed an online museum last year with India foundation for arts with a similar UI concept. Nonlinear interfaces works really well for exploration.

09/02/2024, 16:18 - Sthit AI Group: <Media omitted>
09/02/2024, 16:20 - Charu Tak: Thank you so much ❤️ 
I was planning on having some element of crowdsourcing with maybe some context driving expansion of nodes. 
Hopefully I get a way to ground the data soon too
09/02/2024, 16:21 - Hasan: Can you share the architecture of this please? I have been trying to build something like this for Hindi poems. 🙏
09/02/2024, 16:22 - Charu Tak: send your github id? I will add you to the project?
09/02/2024, 16:22 - Charu Tak: can move this to dm
09/02/2024, 16:23 - Hasan: I will share my GitHub ID, thank you. I also think many people here would be interested in how this is working.
09/02/2024, 16:30 - Charu Tak: Aah okay, 
Tech side is standard d3 library with some custom forces modifications to make it work.

For the generation of data I am using gpt 3.5, (4 was getting very expensive :( ) 
For every concept it tries to give you certain sub topics that you might want to learn. For the sub nodes, it actually doesnt know the whole graph, just its hierarchy in the the whole graph. 

So for example, for some music node the input to gpt will be 
Music:Music Theory:Scales

So then it will return something like
[Major Scale: Minor Scale: Dorian Scale:etc] , didn't think sending the whole graph would be smart at this point. 
Thinking of more improvements with quality as I get more feedback. 
I can share more details if people are interested.
09/02/2024, 16:33 - Hasan: Fascinating! One more question, are you getting json data from gpt 3.5 reliably every time?
09/02/2024, 16:33 - Charu Tak: it's actually even more trivial than that. It just returns this string
[Major Scale: Minor Scale: Dorian Scale:etc]
09/02/2024, 16:34 - Charu Tak: I had to change it to something structured but gpt never made an error in this, so I havent bothered xD
09/02/2024, 16:35 - Charu Tak: The only time it fails this, is when people search something random which actually works for me. Because I use that to show an error message to search again
09/02/2024, 16:35 - Hasan: Sweet. I will DM you about this but I would love to run this on a local LLM, this could be very very useful for me in building interactive informative experiences.
09/02/2024, 16:36 - Charu Tak: oh yea, should be fairly easy to do that. :D
09/02/2024, 17:29 - Prasad Crypt: if cost of ai apis is an issue, wikipedia has free apis and since this is knowledge graphs, maybe something to look at. 

there is this hierarchy travelling architecture about wikipedia articles, like if you go on clicking parent article, you reach philosophy in certain number of steps. so it could be a way to represent knowledge in a top down format.

it would be a different architecture though.
09/02/2024, 18:39 - Charu Tak: Yea let me think about it, after 3.5 the cost became pretty less. So lets see when it becomes an issue again.
09/02/2024, 18:59 - Goji: Hey Everyone! Made a quick workflow tutorial on posting LONG images on Instagram with Midjourney!

09/02/2024, 19:42 - Vamshi: Fun stuff, the music fork of this discussion reminded me of a demo that was a “manifold interface” for drum samples.

Gestural navigation of such spaces would very interesting too, particularly in the musical context.

Maybe even an audio => text => graph => spatial mapping
09/02/2024, 19:44 - Vamshi: An obvious mapping that I’ve explored myself is navigating such an organic visual UI for a taxonomy of music samples from a sample library
09/02/2024, 19:44 - Vamshi: It was actually perform-able and very fun!
09/02/2024, 19:49 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Here is a graph like spatial space called "every noise" I go to often to find new genres and musical ideas. Maybe a fun reference for some folks here <This message was edited>

10/02/2024, 02:07 - Vamshi: Haha yeah I love every noise, big favourite of mine too. 

I want exactly the nano micro version of that, for navigating individual samples. No sure what the labels on it would be, maybe no labels, but just some “interesting” dimensions of the learnt embedding of a an entire training set of samples.
10/02/2024, 02:08 - Vamshi: It’s reached the point where the best way to make a tool is to procrastinate, and someone will “grow” it as a model, and then you can just use it creatively 😅
10/02/2024, 02:10 - Vamshi: On that note, did Suno AI release anything in the open on vocal synthesis? Or anyone else for that matter?
10/02/2024, 02:17 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Stable audio released their paper and model weights trained on creative commons coming soon. MusicGen has released inference check points but no model weights. Suno is trained on a lot of unlicensed data so it won't release model weights or checkpoints. But it's pretty easy for each of the foundation models to release checkpoints/weights trained on free music archive and other open music
10/02/2024, 02:18 - Vamshi: Oh, can stable audio’s model also be used to generate singing voice from text? Didn’t realise that! Will check it out!
10/02/2024, 02:20 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Their current website version is trained on the music from audio Sparx which has vocals also, so it can do vocals but you can't prompt it with famous singers names.
10/02/2024, 02:21 - Vamshi: This is already cool, thanks I followed the news, but missed this main item.
10/02/2024, 02:21 - +1 (857) 991-6423: For samples the two I'm checking out now are

11/02/2024, 17:21 - +91 99102 70434: Every Noise at Once is an ongoing attempt at an algorithmically-generated, readability-adjusted scatter-plot of the musical genre-space, based on data tracked and analyzed for 6,291 genre-shaped distinctions by Spotify as of 2023-11-19. The calibration is fuzzy, but in general down is more organic, up is more mechanical and electric; left is denser and more atmospheric, right is spikier and bouncier.
11/02/2024, 17:22 - +91 99102 70434: not sure if i understand how the clustring and adjacency is being done here... is it like Music Genome Project but without Human Volunteer
11/02/2024, 17:22 - +91 99102 70434: ?
11/02/2024, 18:17 - +1 (857) 991-6423: If you look at Spotify API, it extracts a low level (like spectrogram centroid) to high level descriptor (like beat positions, notes from chromatrams) etc. from each song. That's what every noise uses for clustering. While music genome project used by Pandora was more built in musicologist labels
11/02/2024, 22:44 - +91 97079 48595: There’s this instagram page that makes vertical frames from movie clips and they’re amazing!!

12/02/2024, 07:08 - +65 9069 0114: Quite interesting. How do you think they are doing it?
12/02/2024, 07:15 - +1 (857) 991-6423: looks like there are no movements, shadows or occlusions in the top and bottom third that they add, in the carefully chosen scenes that they are using. Seems easy enough to take a good frame from the scene and use Adobe's generate fill or any outpainting tool to create the extension of the frame as still images, and just use the static image for the entire scene.
12/02/2024, 08:36 - +65 9069 0114: Yea that was my first reaction as well. This is technicallt out painting. Works on simple images but can be a hit and trial on motion videos. They don't have a page or website also. If anyone knows someone there then would love to explore some partnership. Have DM’Ed them on Instagram
12/02/2024, 12:06 - +91 77048 92000: Very cleanly done

We worked on something similar in 2007 called “Search Radar” for Webaroo, where it’ll find contextual things related to your search. 

That product evolved into “WikiSlices” for Webaroo, where this tool would assist what pages to harvest from Wikipedia for a topic, (e.g. if Harvesting Harry Potter, harvest JK Rowling’s page, but because her page is there, dont crawl “List of British Authors” 

@919982084784 , a suggestion, in your roadmap, could you also perhaps add Keyboard Navigation ? 

Basically name all outbound links (1-9, a, s, d, f..) so its easier to navigate the web.

Sora looks promising and in few months we will have multiple such “B roll” options to make stock footage. But will they allow uploading products, character images into Sora production process? Are there copyright concerns or more than that?

19/02/2024, 01:07 - +91 86579 73450: Forgot to share my social media handle, I post literature on these topics (soon gonna archive and organize on are.na). Posting incase anyone's interested in those topics

19/02/2024, 01:54 - +91 88262 15025: the AI tutor actually reminded me of synthesis.school 's interface
19/02/2024, 01:57 - +91 86579 73450: Oh nice, there's also 

https://www.snapxam.com/

19/02/2024, 02:05 - +91 86579 73450: So there's this guy Seymour Papert who came up with this way of teaching called constructionism where he basically said that instead of starting with the scientific notation, what the teacher should do is construct a series of mental models in students by talking about some real world activity that they do, make them question stuff related to that activity and form intuitions and then finally to introduce the notation. Think AI tutors real use case would be to help teachers come up with those creative scenarios and mental models. 

Here's a great essay on papert's ideas https://twitter.com/impactology/status/1710339008214044953?t=F_oW0BR06gR6zSMCgW-psA&s=19
19/02/2024, 02:08 - +1 (857) 991-6423: My favorite quote from Pappert is "You Can’t Think About Thinking  Without Thinking About  Thinking About Something"
19/02/2024, 02:08 - +91 86579 73450: Like for example this guy who teaches fashion design (specifically draping) by using principles of non-euclidean geometry (geometry of curved surfaces) 

Here's how he describes his course 

Non-Euclidean Patternmaking” is a new form of fashion patternmaking based on the mathematics of Non-Euclidean geometry which fundamentally changes the way we understand and practise fashion design" by DrMarkLiu 

https://www.drmarkliu.com/noneuclidean-patternmaking
19/02/2024, 02:09 - +91 86579 73450: Imagine learning about Topology and Non-Euclidean geometry through experimenting with draping and cuts in fashion design
19/02/2024, 02:09 - +91 86579 73450: We need artist-mathematician and artist-physicist hybrid to come up with interesting projects that come up with assignments, exercises for students that don't feel like drills.

And maybe that's where AI tutors can be helpful
19/02/2024, 02:10 - +91 86579 73450: You ever wonder what if physics, math was taught alongside or via fine arts/performing arts? 

How interesting the pedagogy would be 

A complete integration of art, science and engineering pedagogy 

Intersection of Philosophy of math, physics & sciart
19/02/2024, 02:11 - +91 86579 73450: Really sad how we have compartmentalized and created dichotomies for ways of thinking, feeling for "creative" "artistic" pursuits and logical, analytical ones. 

Sucks that there's a schism between art and science.

And maybe here AI can help too. In helping find more overlaps, in being more interdisciplinary

19/02/2024, 02:20 - +1 (857) 991-6423: I think pedagogical creativity as you put it has various academic approaches. I think Mitch Resnick's group called 'lifelong kindergarten' here at the MIT media lab seems to be close to what you describe, carrying forwards Seymour 's legacy.
19/02/2024, 02:20 - +91 86579 73450: Ah you're right

19/02/2024, 09:55 - +91 87420 23550: Adoption due to Cost saving ?
19/02/2024, 10:11 - Prasad Crypt: Looks like. They did have courtesy to provide credit though at the top saying ai generated 😅
19/02/2024, 10:12 - +91 87420 23550: True
19/02/2024, 10:12 - +91 87420 23550: I think must be part of a larger publication group
19/02/2024, 10:12 - +91 87420 23550: and the adaption must be across vernacular languages
19/02/2024, 10:14 - Prasad Crypt: Right actually, this is Maharashtra times
19/02/2024, 10:14 - +91 99102 70434: Thanks 🙏 . Anywhere i can read more about it ?
19/02/2024, 10:31 - Sthit AI Group: Elaborate ? Not sure how GEB and accessibility as in making something available in multiple media or forms  are correlated
19/02/2024, 10:32 - +91 86579 73450: Woah think we are going to see it's use in election campaigns too then

19/02/2024, 18:27 - +91 99672 80880: Combining concepts from multiple domains and stitching them together is a rare skill. Looking forward to the new ways of learning using AI tutors!!
19/02/2024, 18:29 - +91 86579 73450: Exactly, and it's something that could be taught to teachers. Imagine if the AI tutor was geared towards teacher training instead, like assisting teachers in developing that skill of combining and reframing concepts, developing their pedagogical creativity. An interactive teacher training tool

The background score seemingly uses the AI voice of legendary actor and singer Mahendra Kapoor in a patriotic tone, highlighting Modi’s achievements. Would you know who can help verify if it's AI enhanced/recreated or not?

06/03/2024, 20:13 - Vamshi: Haha Suno never fails to surprise
07/03/2024, 00:08 - Vamshi: V2 model has been high variability with some bad responses many mediocre responses
07/03/2024, 00:08 - Vamshi: But the few great responses more than make up for it
07/03/2024, 00:09 - Vamshi: I’ve had a hard time figuring out how to go about training and equivalent model, even in theory
07/03/2024, 00:09 - Vamshi: Does one start with the bark model ?
07/03/2024, 00:10 - Vamshi: On the purely “use and thrive” side, I wish they would make the stems available individually
07/03/2024, 00:10 - Vamshi: As with most models I guess it’s not a trivial problem
07/03/2024, 00:11 - Vamshi: If I say “vocal acapella in afrobeat style” it mistakenly uses those words in the song itself
07/03/2024, 00:11 - Vamshi: Yet to try V3
07/03/2024, 00:12 - Vamshi: Running the song through fb demucs results in super low quality stems
07/03/2024, 00:12 - Vamshi: Worse than for most YouTube content
07/03/2024, 00:13 - +1 (857) 991-6423: V3 is that shiny new box that makes songs for you. I found absolutely 0 joy in using it as a musician. I want to be involved in the music making, not just request and receive. That's why I prefer making my own custom models or using the other tools made with musicians in mind, like RAVE plugins, stable audio, sounds.studio etc <This message was edited>
07/03/2024, 00:13 - Vamshi: Do any of them generate singing vocals ? <This message was edited>
07/03/2024, 00:15 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Yes, stable audio does but you can't condition their public model on lyrics yet. also I'd like to own the publicity rights to the vocals I use, so I'll either use the many RVC model marketplaces where vocalists are renting their voice models or make my own
07/03/2024, 00:20 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Also for this, I am working on aspects of this for my PhD, it's a continuous arms race against the methods used to create clones. But for the Sovits and RVC (which have pretty much stayed the same for a year) I would point you to these academic challenges

07/03/2024, 00:22 - +1 (857) 991-6423: they usually work similar to GPT text detections (albeit even those arent that good), by looking at the perplexity, especially since the same audio tokens are reused a lot in RVC generation
07/03/2024, 00:29 - Vamshi: Suno mentions it’s ok for commercial use if you are on their subscriptions. 

Thanks for reminding me about RVC. So my current plan is to Suno => FB demucs => RVC to get cleaner vocals. Need to try this though … <This message was edited>

07/03/2024, 00:31 - +1 (857) 991-6423: also copyright of a song, is different from publicity rights of a voice, is different from copyright of the composition. So i would tread that rope carefully
07/03/2024, 00:32 - Vamshi: Seems reasonable to begin with? Yes recall reading this
07/03/2024, 00:35 - +1 (857) 991-6423: not to turn you away from the tech! please feel free to use and create with and without commercial and experimental tools! Surely we can't let a bunch of tech folks deciding what the next musical instruments look like.

07/03/2024, 00:39 - Vamshi: It helps that most releases are of little commercial value, so if it’s reached a point where someone is requesting a takedown it’s literally a success story 😅
07/03/2024, 00:40 - Vamshi: Of course if you’re building a tech platform around it it’s a different story

14/03/2024, 19:56 - Prasad Crypt: there is no hidden logic or something here sorry. 7 shuddha swaras + additional 5 accessary swaras make 12. each has two shrutis which makes 24. since tanpura is used as drone and it plays sa and pa, if you sing shrutis around these two, you hear acoustic beats so 2 shrutis are forbidden so that leaves 22.
14/03/2024, 19:57 - Sthit AI Group: Interesting
14/03/2024, 20:00 - Sthit AI Group: Why are two forbidden ?

From what I understand, 22 divisions is basically the maximum resolution of frequency within an octave that is perceivable by the human ear right ? Or am I completely off here ?
14/03/2024, 20:05 - Prasad Crypt: max resolution, not exactly. 7 and 12 are arbitrary numbers. shrutis are ranges really. see here for details - (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OeTvUQzeg7g). Hindustani classical believes in clarity and contrast so there is besur kshetra where you are not supposed to sing.

for tanpura and acoustic beats see details here - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beat_(acoustics)

if tanpura is tuned to different notes than sa and pa, like done rarely with sa and ni, then different shrutis should be forbidden. its a detailed topic
14/03/2024, 20:06 - Sthit AI Group: Thank you. Will have a view. Appreciate it 🙏

22/03/2024, 14:24 - Divya Tak: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WumyfLEa6bU this is a game design focused talk, but might be relevant for folks who want to do non game type media. She talks very fast and talks about a LOT of things.
22/03/2024, 20:42 - +1 (857) 991-6423: The closest thing for text and audio joint embedding is CLAP, just like CLIP. But it's only been trained on short 10-20 sec audio segments, so doesn't have timing information. It would be great to build a tool like what you suggest using CLAP vectors to give closest score text in the embedding.
22/03/2024, 20:47 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Kate Compton is a legend! Her work on casual creators has a lot of great lessons for art and tech tool builders. Highly recommend listening to her recent talks on generative art as liquid art. <This message was edited>

22/03/2024, 20:48 - Ambika: @919953076613 thanks for introducing her to us all ☀️
22/03/2024, 20:53 - Divya Tak: Oooh
22/03/2024, 20:53 - Divya Tak: I just heard this talk
22/03/2024, 20:53 - Divya Tak: And I was like damn this is cool
22/03/2024, 21:01 - Prasad Crypt: i watched the liquid art talk in the afternoon after lady divya shared. i found that one too much fluff though. i mean, we get it, with better tools you do dynamic things..but liquid art seemed like overlabeled concept.
it could be my problem though (most likely) as i am a minimalist when it comes to thinking about complexities 😅
22/03/2024, 21:03 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Haha great! I think the more artists using generative AI for their own artistic ends, we can have many more philosophies on where the value lies in the age of low effort infinite generation.
22/03/2024, 21:15 - Prasad Crypt: reminds me of this old nautilus article - https://nautil.us/waiting-for-the-robot-rembrandt-236957/

they divide into 4 classes -  (1) Human Art / Human Aesthetics, (2) Human Art / Machine Aesthetics, (3) Machine Art / Human Aesthetics, and (4) Machine Art / Machine Aesthetics. Its going to be fun

Hello Everyone!

A little about myself: I am an ML engineer by profession, with a passion for building creative tools during weekends.

Here are a few cool projects I've worked on:
- Developing an AI that choreographs dance steps. Check it out here: https://github.com/ajay-sreeram/Music2Dance. You can watch the demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Db79bIJvxdw.
- Creating a tool that turns thoughts directly into webpages. You can read about it here: https://www.kdnuggets.com/2021/11/dream-come-true-allennlp-hacks-21.html. Watch the demo here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UsyiS9gooNo.

Looking forward to sharing more and learning from everyone here! <This message was edited>

this is the real job killer :P
25/03/2024, 20:41 - Divya Tak: not the AI part, but when the client doesn't have to explain
25/03/2024, 20:51 - Prasad Crypt: Looks like the demo videos have gotten swapped.
Maybe we need ai tool to write WhatsApp messages 🔥
25/03/2024, 20:56 - +91 83318 16758: Fixed it, thanks for finding it. 

Soon offline models will takecare of it I guess

27/03/2024, 18:04 - +91 90228 45040: Umm, sorry, you don’t have a problem with Pigs having Wings, but have one with them not having legs? 

The legs might just pop out when its near landing 

Its Fantasy, we have Mermaids and Centaurs and even Dronkey!
27/03/2024, 18:06 - +91 90228 45040: Are you also expecting a lot from 1.0 release ?
27/03/2024, 18:07 - +91 81784 02951: <Media omitted>
27/03/2024, 18:09 - +91 99289 98920: Because it makes these default physics mistakes and that will take time, creating fantasy worlds is what it does ‘well’
27/03/2024, 18:32 - +91 70430 36493: No my point is how people are amazed by these videos that they are not correct in terms of body anatomy. We have had pictures of 'pigs with wings' since long back. They had four legs and wings.
Legs don't just pop out. It's not a machine
27/03/2024, 18:34 - +91 70430 36493: Yeah the understanding of the nature and things takes a backseat when you are too busy releasing in this competitive market
27/03/2024, 19:02 - Prasad Crypt: Correctness of ai generated videos is obidience to the prompt. If someone asks flying pigs, and ai delivered then it did a good job. Physical reality doesn't matter IMO since creaters, even for human generated content are not interested in reality 😅
27/03/2024, 19:15 - Divya Tak: Hey Amrita we strongly discourage sharing self promotional social media posts. If you want to have a discussion about the topic, you're welcome to start the discussion but don't share links to your sm accounts
27/03/2024, 19:16 - Divya Tak: If reality was interesting, one wouldn't need to make art 😂😂
27/03/2024, 19:17 - Divya Tak: Because there are things that are interesting in those videos. Even without being 100% accurate they can be interesting, especially as creatives. The previs potential for ai videos is amazing
27/03/2024, 19:18 - +91 81784 02951: That's a lot of work to do with CGI!
27/03/2024, 19:19 - +91 70430 36493: Okay sorry about that. Will take it down from here. I didn't mean to disrespect the guidelines
27/03/2024, 19:24 - +91 70430 36493: Yes of course, things are interesting like the horsefly was quite fascinating
27/03/2024, 19:25 - Divya Tak: Yeah! Can't wait for these to get there
27/03/2024, 19:26 - Divya Tak: No I didn't mean subject. Just the fact that we can get these kind of videos is quite incredible
27/03/2024, 19:31 - +91 90228 45040: I dont think you can “Define” the concept of Fantasy. 

- We dint have Dronkeys till Shrek. I am an avid Fantasy reader and I haven’t read about them before Shrek. I was repulsed and excited at same time.
- ⁠We have had walking Houses, long ago in fairy tales, also seen in AntMan: Quantumania (where its a mix of Sci-Fi and Molecular dimension fantasy) 
- ⁠Scifi is also filled with Space Whales, and Organic (Living) Ships that fly through space. 

Fantasy is only limited by Imagination. 

Maybe these Flying Pigs belong to a World filled with 95% water, they just land on water and float on surface, who knows ? 

I am amazed.  I know its not perfect, but yes I am amazed. 

It may not fit the story you have in mind, but does it not generate new story possibilities ? If yes, I think its a net positive direction.
27/03/2024, 19:34 - Prasad Crypt: I used to think so. Then I read about an artist's experience about paintings at national gallery and I think differently now. The paintings are not real and thats precisely why they represent a reality which is incorruptible. Normal reality is always tainted by consciousness making it worthless but one what is already imagined exists on a different plane and we are more forgiving towards it. So even artists working on fantasy are in fact thinking about realities 😝
27/03/2024, 19:35 - Divya Tak: I think we're trying to say the same thing
27/03/2024, 19:36 - Divya Tak: All I mean is replicating "reality" accurately is not an artistic holy grail
27/03/2024, 19:39 - Prasad Crypt: erm well...then we are not talking about the same thing. I agree with you on the part that fantasy animals dont have to obey physics though.
27/03/2024, 19:40 - +91 90228 45040: Can you simplify this. I read this a few times and was thinking what Divya said, but apparently I misinterpreted too.
27/03/2024, 19:40 - +91 90228 45040: Was about to put this in ChatGPT and ELI5
27/03/2024, 19:46 - +91 70430 36493: I am not defining 'fantasy'.  
I am saying there needs to be a basis. 

The reason people said flying pigs is because they imagined an anatomy where if you could add wings maybe a pig could fly? 
Also it came from chrysaor a winged boar in Greek mythology.

Back in the day, people used to observe nature and make surreal and fantasy drawings but they had good understanding of the anatomy and body physics.

Now a days we skip that because we are too busy putting 'art' out there. There is no time to think about this concept deeper.

Even the world that you described will not have a pig whose anatomy will look like that. 

Dronkey is a quadruped animal also observe the drawing it's a donkey with 'wings' , no legs missing.

Amazement, fascination is different from this. 

But if the concept has more thought it would have deeper meaning that's all I am saying.
27/03/2024, 19:47 - Prasad Crypt: <Media omitted>
27/03/2024, 19:54 - +91 90228 45040: I love the discussion. 

I said “Dronkey” didnt come before Shrek, (I get the “If Pigs could fly” slang from English and Chrysaor from Greek) 

Dronkey were offsprings of a love affair between a Dragon and a Donkey. A Foolish Clown of an Animal with the most Majestic Fantasy creature ever, but Love makes everyone silly, that was the point of that story. 

When you say:

_Even the world that you described will not have a pig whose anatomy will look like that._ 

Could you elaborate?, If it can just Paddle with the hindlegs, like a motorboat does with the fan at rear end, and its volume/density is good enough for keeping it afloat, what more does it need ? 

True, Amazement and Fascination are relative. If you can create this using the Tools and Skills you have, you’d say this is Mediocre. To the large audience who struggles to even draw, this is AMAZING! (Myself Included)
27/03/2024, 19:56 - +91 90228 45040: If this a sort of “Midjourney Cant Draw Hands/Fingers properly, Why is it even being applauded”  Issue ?  If yes, then its 1.0 release, give it time to Rise upto your standards.

30/03/2024, 20:16 - Sthit AI Group: Synplant 2 is the key to the universe I feel like sometimes. Pardon the exxageration 😂
30/03/2024, 20:18 - +1 (857) 991-6423: I have been waiting to try it, in your experience of using it, which sounds is good with recreating and which ones is it bad at?
30/03/2024, 20:18 - Rohan Ramanna: Synthplant 2 is great for tonal stuff
30/03/2024, 20:18 - Rohan Ramanna: And visco for transient heavy stuff
30/03/2024, 20:19 - Rohan Ramanna: Although the time stretching in visco is quite something

30/03/2024, 20:20 - Sthit AI Group: It supports sample imports which are then resynthesized, so you know 0 limits to sound type, sometimes the sounds generated can be , shall we say lacking that analogy feel, slight overdrive or tape distortion helps with that
30/03/2024, 20:20 - Rohan Ramanna: Oh wow sure - happy to beta test if they need anyone 😊
30/03/2024, 20:21 - Rohan Ramanna: I am using it currently to generate huge amounts of round robins for repeating sounds in games like footsteps and gunshots etc
30/03/2024, 20:21 - +1 (857) 991-6423: I know it works best with short samples, but I'm curious how does it do with short vocal samples? I wanted to recreate some beatbox and short doo's and daa's from acapella. So you think synthplant would do it?
30/03/2024, 20:21 - Rohan Ramanna: Ohh I tried this
30/03/2024, 20:21 - Rohan Ramanna: On synthplant I through in a vocal sample and created over 100 sfx from just moving the mod wheel
30/03/2024, 20:22 - Rohan Ramanna: I ll upload a video if you want 😊 but if you try it your self I think you might be just as astonished as I was
30/03/2024, 20:22 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Love this!
30/03/2024, 20:23 - Rohan Ramanna: Nothing sounded like a human voice but very cool sci fi sound design stuff

02/04/2024, 06:20 - Prasad Crypt: There's the concept of Explainable ai where ai can tell what overarching thought or process it went through in the act of creation
02/04/2024, 08:57 - +91 90357 61806: GenAI is a blackbox. _why_ is unanswerable. Referenced songs/images can not be retrieved because the "referencing" never happens. Only a diffusion through a path in multi dimensional space guided by the input parameters happens. You can think of the process like, randomly splashing different colors (user input or prompt), taking a string (params) and pulling it across (params), you may never know _why_ the output is a specific way.
02/04/2024, 11:33 - +91 90228 45040: I fear this direction. 

Either AI will be like my Grandma, Ironing out Jeans, stiching all the Holes, and putting them in wash after wearing one full days or 2 sort of 1/2 days after school 

Or it’ll be trained on data from multitudes of Hostels and will spit out half of laundry saying, you can still wear this, save water … blah blah .

02/04/2024, 15:56 - Rohan Ramanna: As in - if there were a payment model for all the artists - it would have to be based on the dataset used and perhaps the artists contribution to it - either that or universal basic income 😂😂

03/04/2024, 08:47 - Soumyadeep: What do you mean by 4/2-SDXL? 🤔
03/04/2024, 08:55 - Ambika: Step I mean. Sorry. 2 or 4-step sdxl
03/04/2024, 08:58 - Soumyadeep: LCM is way better than 2 step SDXL
03/04/2024, 08:58 - Soumyadeep: We use LCM in almost 100% of our generations now.
03/04/2024, 09:04 - Ambika: 🙏
03/04/2024, 09:05 - Ambika: Better in the quality/consistency/something?
03/04/2024, 09:06 - Soumyadeep: 2 step SDXL is pretty bad in all.
03/04/2024, 09:06 - Soumyadeep: I have a feeling you mean SDXL Lightning 2 step
03/04/2024, 09:06 - Soumyadeep: In that case, its very very similar.
03/04/2024, 09:07 - Ambika: Similar to LCM or this?
03/04/2024, 09:07 - Ambika: Basically LCM is still in top is what I’m hearing.
03/04/2024, 09:07 - Soumyadeep: Yea LCM is better
03/04/2024, 09:08 - Ambika: Ok cool
03/04/2024, 09:08 - Ambika: 🙏
03/04/2024, 09:33 - Harsha Dashtoon: Take a look at lightning over LCM. Much better visual quality.
03/04/2024, 09:34 - Ambika: Oh ok
03/04/2024, 09:34 - Ambika: 2 or 4 step?
03/04/2024, 09:35 - Harsha Dashtoon: 4. 8 is preferable. But 4 works
03/04/2024, 09:35 - Ambika: 👌
03/04/2024, 09:37 - Harsha Dashtoon: So another thing with lightning is that if the cfg is 1, the speed increases by 1.5x. So for faster generations, try experimenting with samplers that give good output even with a cfg of 1.
03/04/2024, 09:39 - Ambika: ☀️
03/04/2024, 10:38 - Karthik Tk Berkeley Music: In my opinion, if you need realistic images to be generated, I prefer using SDXL as it gives better quality with minimal steps and prompts.

03/04/2024, 21:09 - Prasad Crypt: some long samples here - https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=k04RGJBHTv8
03/04/2024, 21:30 - Karthik Tk Berkeley Music: Base also works. But, I find turbo to be better as it is more fine-tuned.
03/04/2024, 21:33 - Karthik Tk Berkeley Music: Also, I don't think turbo is available for commercial license.
03/04/2024, 21:52 - Ambika: @919902574049 thank you! 🙂
04/04/2024, 15:40 - +91 83318 16758: This is wild 
https://www.suno.ai/
04/04/2024, 15:41 - Rohan Ramanna: The mixes on this are far superior to Suno - which was an issue thus far for Ai generated music - but yes coherency and the fact that it does so much is absolutely mind blowing
04/04/2024, 15:43 - Rohan Ramanna: Distributors have been deleting ai generated music from thier platforms and one of the key factors of how they are finding it - are the mixes suno outputs are quite lowfi
04/04/2024, 15:43 - Rohan Ramanna: This will make it much harder
04/04/2024, 15:55 - Prasad Crypt: So far suno feels like a starting point, then real singer and musician redo the thing and make it pro quality. Something like a visual artist would do several sketches before actually finalising something. Still has lot of value though because of inspiration it provides/trimming of possibility space to make the final job easier etc.
04/04/2024, 16:06 - Vamshi: Suno is still insanely ahead with the singing voice part and the overall ideation.

What’s sad is that there’s no open equivalent. 

Did anyone find vocal examples for the new stable audio release? I seem to have missed it, or it isn’t there …
04/04/2024, 16:07 - Vamshi: There’s things like ace studio to hand craft and chisel through vocals, which is nice though
04/04/2024, 16:08 - Rohan Ramanna: yes i use ace and Kits
04/04/2024, 16:08 - Rohan Ramanna: to replace voices
04/04/2024, 16:08 - Rohan Ramanna: just for demo work
04/04/2024, 16:08 - Rohan Ramanna: very very good utility
04/04/2024, 16:08 - Rohan Ramanna: but v scary haha
04/04/2024, 16:10 - Prasad Crypt: True. From tech point of view all this is very fascinating
04/04/2024, 16:12 - Rohan Ramanna: I really do feel its just a matter of time, just like going from 512 to 1024 in Stable diffusion, wont be long for Suno to start sounding indistinguishable
04/04/2024, 16:12 - Rohan Ramanna: from commercial releases
04/04/2024, 16:12 - Vamshi: It’s usable creatively too, still roundabout though. Maybe a good thing 😅
04/04/2024, 16:12 - Rohan Ramanna: do you think its the quality of the dataset? I feel trimming of the bitrate at this stage has led to low fi output
04/04/2024, 16:13 - Rohan Ramanna: just an assumption from my side
04/04/2024, 16:13 - Vamshi: I think we have ex Suno folks in here. They definitely seem to have everything, probably being careful with licensing or frugal with compute. Or both. <This message was edited>
04/04/2024, 16:14 - Rohan Ramanna: haha I am sure they will know all about the preprocessing on the dataset!
04/04/2024, 16:14 - Vamshi: I posted this in the other group earlier

https://ai.meta.com/research/publications/scenescript-reconstructing-scenes-with-an-autoregressive-structured-language-model/
04/04/2024, 16:15 - Prasad Crypt: Upscaling is easy problem than generating the basics, if it was deliberately downqualitied
04/04/2024, 16:15 - Vamshi: A similar approach would be the most obvious roadmap for all music tools
04/04/2024, 16:15 - Vamshi: Underlying structured representation
04/04/2024, 16:16 - Vamshi: Posting here purely for workflow value
04/04/2024, 16:17 - Rohan Ramanna: thanks for the Info! very helpful 🙂
04/04/2024, 16:23 - Vamshi: This is only partly correct. I believe the tools are out there, including Sunos published work on GitHub.

But I think none of the releases include all the key pieces required to roll your own and just deploy an app, locally or online, to recreate the functionality.

Not yet truly open.
04/04/2024, 16:24 - Vamshi: Well “truly” is a bit too much of an aspiration in AI land anyways, but enough said 😅

05/04/2024, 13:17 - +91 95001 92175: There are actually multiple ways to solve this with AI. One example is you can feed it to AI to create a mesh, and then animate it with mocap videos. 

Currently limitations, different repos are required based on quality requirements. Example: Clothes on meshes are a separate repo, hair topology of the woman is a separate repo, light generation on the scene is a separate repo. 

Think of it as a Comfy UI but for animating characters. The more control you need over the end generation the more tech is required.
05/04/2024, 13:33 - +91 95001 92175: <Media omitted>
05/04/2024, 13:35 - +91 95001 92175: @919022845040 the same is possible with the man as well. Combined animation is difficult as of now, but individual animation can be done like the above video.

05/04/2024, 15:08 - +91 98982 47919: Hello you all! 
I am doing a research for my project, so I require some inputs from creative people using AI! 

“How generative ai will change your life? “ 

Any inputs are welcome
05/04/2024, 15:10 - Rohan Ramanna: Will completely change mine - I am a full time music composer/producer and mix engineer - so I think my job will go from creating to curating - perhaps I will be come a consultant (if I am lucky ) - I pray for some form of universal basic income in return for all these creative jobs being lost - but honestly it seems extremely complicated to actually make that a reality <This message was edited>
05/04/2024, 15:11 - +91 90228 45040: @919898247919
05/04/2024, 15:15 - Rohan Ramanna: Honestly I can see suno and stable audio making agency people extremely happy as they do not need to hire humans to create “jingles” etc - to be honest we have already been getting demo “jingles” from some of these big agencies - where we just have to recreate it in a more professional light - won’t be surprised if we start getting ai generations next
05/04/2024, 15:15 - Rohan Ramanna: By agency people I mean advertising agency - just to be clear :)
05/04/2024, 15:19 - +91 90228 45040: Honest Answer. 

I am from a UX background and it has accelerated a lot of our workflows. 
- It helps write specs, both for Design and Product, and at times catches some corner cases which we might have missed (also misses sometimes, but is easier to correct) 
- ⁠Can generate tons of options in Color choices etc. 
- ⁠Has reduced cost of Stock Images, Icon sets etc. for prototyping, and at times for final deliverables.  
- ⁠Has reduced time to make and scrap options for internal / stakeholder approval. 

The way its changing perception though, is like Digital Camera totally ruined the “cost/ affordance” of Photos (24 pic reel) and launched the era of Selfies, its changing the attachment to grunt work. Earlier I used to feel a bit bad if I’d present couple of options and all but one of them got rejected. (Although I knew only one would win at end). And as I worked more and more, I learnt how to present only one option but present it better and do incremental changes. 

AI is now making the “Do more options” era come back again, and I see the advantages of it, and wont “feel” bad on their rejection. 
This is future. 
 
The biggest saving for me/my team at present, is time.
05/04/2024, 15:28 - Prasad Crypt: I have not talent for creating. I don't sing nor play an instrument nor compose using software. I do have an aesthetic sense though. Gen ai will allow me to create cool things in spite of having no talent.

I also work in tech that supports gen ai so for now we are making truckloads of money and after ai starts coding and I lose my job there is universal basic income 😅
05/04/2024, 15:30 - +91 90228 45040: Truckloads! Partyyyy! 🔥 🕺💃🍻!
05/04/2024, 15:35 - +91 98982 47919: But these are current scenrios, how WILL generative ai will change your life? What you imagine more to come in more creative, or emotional way
05/04/2024, 15:36 - Divya Tak: Higher accessibility and more mixed media work, more democratisation of creativity, shift away from pure craft oriented stuff, people being able to express more easily, some amount of cheapening of quality for a bit
05/04/2024, 15:38 - Rohan Ramanna: Not a current scenario for me yet - but it’s definitely coming - hoping for the best really just prepping for the worst
05/04/2024, 15:42 - +1 (857) 991-6423: A lot of homogenization of ideas with low effort, infinite generation. A shift of the values from the noun form of the art to the verb form of the processes.
05/04/2024, 15:47 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Maybe other immediate effects on theft, misinformation, inauthenticity, choice fatigue, shifting labor forces. More artist / writer / actor / labor protests forcing protection through regulation.
05/04/2024, 15:55 - +1 (857) 991-6423: New technology is often used to do what we already do, (maybe faster, efficient, cheaper, appropriated etc - a pastiche) but soon gives was to new forms of aesthetics, values, cultures. I have my speculations of what I hope that looks like as I'm sure do all of you super creative folks 🌱 <This message was edited>
05/04/2024, 16:55 - +91 70928 62522: We would be making a shift from URL to IRL . 
Live performances would boom and you could make a living that way.
Maybe new mixed media performance arts would emerge (some of the frontrunners for those could belong to this group itself)
05/04/2024, 16:57 - +91 70928 62522: Would love to know your sepculations!
05/04/2024, 17:27 - +91 70930 03840: Hey @919898247919 very interesting question as you are also focusing on the future.

With passing time the cost of gen-AI will reduce and it would be at every person’s fingertips. I think this is the time when AI artist will become very popular and have their own fan-following.

In social networking space also, I think there will be more platforms introduced which will provide one or the other AI creativity generation and showcasing tools.
05/04/2024, 19:01 - Vamshi: Does comfy ui have a generally accepted workflow for dance?
05/04/2024, 19:01 - Vamshi: Anybody recognise the workflow used in such videos

05/04/2024, 19:21 - +91 95001 92175: Don’t know whether comfyUI has one. There are few papers like the one I shared which showcase how to create  animation
05/04/2024, 19:22 - Vamshi: Maybe this one is just face swap followed by style transfer ?
05/04/2024, 21:19 - Divya Tak: I think it is that. The movements are too smooth to be ai generated (yet)
05/04/2024, 21:22 - +1 (857) 991-6423: AnimateDiff vid2vid on an existing dance video followed by face swap
05/04/2024, 21:23 - +1 (857) 991-6423: I think I've seen comfy UI tutorials for it too, though there are other experts here

10/04/2024, 22:16 - +91 88980 20185: udio.com launched text to song today. you can also give it a try. it's really cool
10/04/2024, 22:17 - +91 88980 20185: prompt was "song on potato"

10/04/2024, 22:19 - Divya Tak: Oh no my life lonf dream! to write a song about potatoes (not being sarcastic)
10/04/2024, 22:20 - Rohan Ramanna: Waiting to see video 2 music implementation - i.e. creating background scores / music to a driving video
10/04/2024, 22:20 - Rohan Ramanna: It’s the shared dream of many creatives it seems haha
10/04/2024, 22:22 - Rohan Ramanna: For any other music nerds on here have you tried BandLab? It’s actually a super helpful tool for composers on the go - it’s a DAW in a browser with excellent ai tools
10/04/2024, 22:22 - Rohan Ramanna: Not so sure about the song generator on that but - stem splitting - denoising etc - good output all for free 👍🏾
10/04/2024, 22:23 - Rohan Ramanna: Loads of my composer friends have been using it on thier phones
10/04/2024, 22:23 - +91 88980 20185: makes me wonder whether I can do this via gemini 1.5 pro video already. Will give it a deeper thought <This message was edited>
10/04/2024, 22:23 - +91 70928 62522: Didn't know it had these features
10/04/2024, 22:23 - Rohan Ramanna: Even batch denoising audio for podcasts etc - very natural output as compared to adobes model
10/04/2024, 22:24 - Rohan Ramanna: Yes wav output too
10/04/2024, 22:24 - Rohan Ramanna: Better than most free splitters
10/04/2024, 22:24 - +91 70928 62522: Wow..it's been a while since I used it...I think 6 months ago it didn't have these features
10/04/2024, 22:25 - Rohan Ramanna: Ya currently with the tech you posted about - loads of film directors will probably just use that instead of syncing music or hiring a composer
10/04/2024, 22:25 - Rohan Ramanna: Issue is - currently copyrighting this unless there is some manipulation of the audio is v difficult
10/04/2024, 22:26 - +91 88980 20185: yes true
10/04/2024, 22:26 - Rohan Ramanna: I am assuming the laws will follow the image generation ones
10/04/2024, 22:26 - Prasad Crypt: i was planning to use their cakewalk but recently heard its becoming paid, so not sure. will just buy a paid daw i guess
10/04/2024, 22:26 - Rohan Ramanna: Next step is for directors and editors to just throw in footage and pick from a few pieces of music that is perfectly synced to the visual
10/04/2024, 22:27 - Rohan Ramanna: It’s a freemium type thing right now
10/04/2024, 22:27 - Rohan Ramanna: Most of it is free
10/04/2024, 22:27 - Rohan Ramanna: But yea if all of it becomes paid - then yeah I am sure a free competitor is around the corner
10/04/2024, 22:29 - Rohan Ramanna: After looking at the marketplace for assets in unreal engine - I am pretty certain all daws might follow that model - In built marketplace (like splice) with ai gen tools like synthplant and visco along with composition and mix “ai assistants”
10/04/2024, 22:30 - Rohan Ramanna: Open source is truely a blessing - blender and unreal - phew !
10/04/2024, 22:33 - Rohan Ramanna: I guess unreal isn’t open source haha but it being free is mind blowing
10/04/2024, 23:15 - Vamshi: +1 for unreal. 

I’d be real interested to support or be involved in a project that involves the engine for music.

I think epic is probably being careful for the right reasons, but it’s a great match for AI generated assets coming into one place pipeline wise.
10/04/2024, 23:19 - Vamshi: My personal interest was using the virtual production part of the workflow for live streaming music performances.

I set up a working pipeline last year on a single 4090 based system, but have fallen off the rails since with using it.

Happy to chat if any colabs can overlap.
10/04/2024, 23:20 - Rohan Ramanna: I be been diving deep into middleware like fmod cause unreal meta sounds engine is quite combursome to setup still
10/04/2024, 23:20 - Rohan Ramanna: I think perhaps an ai middleware will be the solution
10/04/2024, 23:20 - Rohan Ramanna: No issues with unreal
10/04/2024, 23:21 - Rohan Ramanna: But copywriting will always be an issue until they figure out how they are going to comp all the artists first haha
10/04/2024, 23:21 - Rohan Ramanna: The crux of the problem is the training data to begin with haha
10/04/2024, 23:23 - Rohan Ramanna: But by keeping the middleware the generator and compiler - you absolve any engine from legal issues
11/04/2024, 00:52 - Vamshi: For linear content using UE5, right now, the only real limitation lies between chair and keyboard.

11/04/2024, 00:52 - Rohan Ramanna: Agreed
11/04/2024, 00:52 - Vamshi: Nice to hear of fmod explorers here
11/04/2024, 00:53 - Rohan Ramanna: Yes it’s much more geared to musicians and sound designers - as wwise seems to be developed by programmers for programmers haha
11/04/2024, 00:54 - Rohan Ramanna: It’s nice to know these things exist to be honest !
11/04/2024, 00:54 - Rohan Ramanna: What an ingenious application
11/04/2024, 00:54 - Vamshi: I was on the wwise team in a past life.
The product is actually the brain child of a sound designer.
11/04/2024, 00:55 - Vamshi: Of course it carries a lot of legacy now and owned by Sony I think
11/04/2024, 00:55 - Rohan Ramanna: Haha lies! programmer in sound designers clothing haha jk
11/04/2024, 00:55 - Rohan Ramanna: Please hug that person for me
11/04/2024, 00:55 - Rohan Ramanna: If you ever come across them again
11/04/2024, 00:55 - Rohan Ramanna: Genius’ all of them
11/04/2024, 00:55 - +1 (929) 343-6065: Sheeesh this is so sick!! I’m playing some shows next couple months and have been digging for this. Would love to learn more!
11/04/2024, 00:55 - Rohan Ramanna: Please accept virtual hug from me for helping build such awesome stuff
11/04/2024, 00:56 - Vamshi: 😅
11/04/2024, 00:58 - Rohan Ramanna: As a person who’s studying programming - my adoration for developers of any kind runs super deep
11/04/2024, 00:59 - Rohan Ramanna: It’s so alien - and unfathomable how humans have created all this technology
11/04/2024, 00:59 - Rohan Ramanna: Haha
11/04/2024, 01:00 - Divya Tak: I'm loving all of these music discussions that are happening
11/04/2024, 01:01 - Rohan Ramanna: Haha you mean me fan girling over all the genius people in this group
11/04/2024, 01:01 - Vamshi: The alien part is just starting
11/04/2024, 01:01 - Vamshi: 😄
11/04/2024, 01:03 - Divya Tak: Well you can't go undercover for too long. You've done music on some really cool films yourself 😎😎
11/04/2024, 01:06 - Vamshi: Yeah it’s so cool! And @919930341328 I agree with you about the insanely cool collection of people on here, I know that some collabs have already sparked via this group
11/04/2024, 01:06 - Divya Tak: <Media omitted>
11/04/2024, 01:15 - Vamshi: This is a good ploy. I find the people here so productive I wonder how they have time to make friends 😅
11/04/2024, 01:15 - Vamshi: And catch up on WhatsApp group messages as well
11/04/2024, 01:16 - +91 88265 49607: +1 😂
11/04/2024, 01:17 - Vamshi: To be very clear (since WhatsApp often does this as a side effect), there’s no sarcasm intended in this comment 😄
11/04/2024, 01:20 - Divya Tak: You just need a time turner
11/04/2024, 01:22 - Rohan Ramanna: Well, once again, thank you for having me 🙏
11/04/2024, 01:41 - Divya Tak: On a more serious note, atleast for me, I don't know how I can expect myself to be inspired if I don't expose myself to a lot of different people. When I don't expose my mind to a wide variety of realities, it starts becoming calcified in its own self, and tries to use it as a shell. And then work I make also becomes stale
11/04/2024, 06:27 - Prasad Crypt: Studying programming 👀. Have you tried sonic pi 🤨
11/04/2024, 06:28 - Rohan Ramanna: Haha 😂 I know it sounds redundant - I am after the fundamentals - just to open my mind to new ways of thinking - I felt I should be able to tinker with any any ai generated code
11/04/2024, 06:28 - Rohan Ramanna: But no I have not tried it
11/04/2024, 06:31 - Prasad Crypt: Ah okk. Sonic pi is a creative coding platform and was written for people who are not programmers to start with to make music using programming constructs. Whenever I see creatives who are trying to learn coding I always ask about experience with sonic pi 😅
11/04/2024, 06:44 - Rohan Ramanna: Right right - I was checking it out 😊
11/04/2024, 06:45 - Rohan Ramanna: After you mentioned it - is it based on its own language? C++?
11/04/2024, 06:45 - Rohan Ramanna: I am focusing on c++ and python at the moment
11/04/2024, 06:46 - Sthit AI Group: Based on Ruby
11/04/2024, 06:46 - Sthit AI Group: For interpretation
11/04/2024, 06:46 - Rohan Ramanna: Ah cool all new to me 😊
11/04/2024, 06:46 - Rohan Ramanna: Will do some research - thanks 🙏
11/04/2024, 06:46 - Sthit AI Group: Syntax is quite similar to Python though, simple and intuitive
11/04/2024, 06:47 - Prasad Crypt: ruby yes. if you want c++ and want heavy duty brother of sonic pi, there is supercollider
11/04/2024, 06:48 - Rohan Ramanna: Haha I am sure sonic pi will be challenging enough - 😂, supercollider just sounds like it will make me cry
11/04/2024, 06:48 - Sthit AI Group: Don't fall for the naming. 😂
11/04/2024, 06:49 - Prasad Crypt: haha. i have done coding for 20 years and didnt know about cool stuff like sonic pi

then i joined this group 😂
11/04/2024, 10:15 - +91 77200 33717 requested to join.

11/04/2024, 11:14 - Divya Tak: Omg that a cute generation ❤️❤️
11/04/2024, 11:14 - Divya Tak: Eid Mubarak
11/04/2024, 15:50 - ~ Aj left
11/04/2024, 22:31 - +91 94235 63226: what model did you use?
11/04/2024, 23:08 - +91 90228 45040: MJ v6
11/04/2024, 23:33 - Divya Tak: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C1PMzwqiah2/ this reel was so cool. Like the way people who make music's brain works is insane
12/04/2024, 00:10 - Vamshi: Haha nice.

These guys had a kickstarter almost a decade ago that turned into a company and then went down maybe.

But they had made a fun affordable contact mic with mapper software.

scroll , select, listen. AI generated music from various genres
12/04/2024, 18:29 - Sthit AI Group: If they make an app, I feel a lot of people might use it over streaming 😂
12/04/2024, 18:30 - Rohan Ramanna: Let them haha
12/04/2024, 18:30 - Rohan Ramanna: I dunno if I d pay to watch a robot perform live more than once <This message was edited>
12/04/2024, 18:31 - Rohan Ramanna: But the next gen may be more open to it 😛
12/04/2024, 18:32 - Sthit AI Group: Live music is sublime. But just for a thought exercise, why do you say that ?
12/04/2024, 18:33 - Divya Tak: in times when you want to listen to elevator music :P
12/04/2024, 18:33 - Sthit AI Group: The Sound of Silence 😂
12/04/2024, 18:34 - Divya Tak: Honestly like having played enough games with procedural generation and games with hand crafted design, I think both have their space.
12/04/2024, 18:38 - Rohan Ramanna: I guess there is constant discussions about this at the studio I work out of haha - but the general gist of the conversation is generally based around “the human element of the artistry of music is why people connect” - yes ai will totally be able to produce music indistinguishable from humans very soon - but will people still be interested in music as an artform if it’s mostly made by an ai ? For some the story of the artist and their interpretation of the world is important- objectively - anyone who’s played with a modular synth will be aware of generative workflows that already exist, however the curation of those generations and what is done with the source material is where the artistry lies -  the music community is very divided on this from what I be experienced - again - not my arguments or opinions - just a few common ones I come across from fellow composers
12/04/2024, 18:41 - Sthit AI Group: Aligned. But what happens, if it does happen, that people follow AI personalities and their struggles, similar to how there are influencers on Insta that are all AI as well?
12/04/2024, 18:42 - Rohan Ramanna: Who knows 🤔🤷🏾‍♂️ things I think about everyday
12/04/2024, 18:42 - Sthit AI Group: Personally, I don't think it will happen, just FYI, at least in my lifetime
12/04/2024, 18:43 - Rohan Ramanna: But most of the hate comes from the fact that the datasets that the models have been trained on are going to put most of the people who originally created the data to begin with - out of business - especially without thier knowledge- it’s a hard one to discuss
12/04/2024, 18:43 - Rohan Ramanna: I see it as technological evolution
12/04/2024, 18:44 - Rohan Ramanna: And it’s not a question of if - but when
12/04/2024, 18:44 - Divya Tak: There are already people following imaginary folks like vtubers, so that doesn't seem that far of a stretch
12/04/2024, 18:44 - Rohan Ramanna: We need to adapt as a society otherwise a lot of people are going to be v angry haha
12/04/2024, 18:45 - Sthit AI Group: Yup
12/04/2024, 18:45 - Sthit AI Group: Already are. Know few folks in filmmaking, I can feel the rage in the texts 😅
12/04/2024, 18:47 - Divya Tak: change is hard so I am sure its gonna be a few years of up and down emotions and possibly some polarisation
12/04/2024, 18:47 - Sthit AI Group: Lot of polarisation, akin to what happened in the US writers guild I assume?
12/04/2024, 18:47 - Prasad Crypt: i dont know...humans are driven by meaning. human creation = meaningful vs machine creation = pleasurable but not so meaningful. the main problem is meaning making always scales to whatever is available so that people have certain level of existential crisis. so i think eventually it will come to that. in the end humans will just accept intrinsic meaning of human life and rest is done by ai. and it will be all pervasive, like today work gives meaning to people's lives, it will be gone tomorrow to ai. same thing to arts...
12/04/2024, 18:47 - Sthit AI Group: Handicrafts you mean?
12/04/2024, 18:48 - Divya Tak: nahi he means actual intent behind art
12/04/2024, 18:48 - Sthit AI Group: That can be approximated by AI? As in the reasoning or intent ? Via worldbuilding and storytelling ?
12/04/2024, 18:49 - Rohan Ramanna: Machines and ai - also human creations
12/04/2024, 18:49 - Divya Tak: hmm 🤷‍♀ remains to be seen if AI can make truly interesting stuff. There honestly I feel like its like photography made realism less interesting. But camera doesn't have an artistic eye. And atleast to me, AI is closer to camera.
12/04/2024, 18:49 - Sthit AI Group: Or is emotion factoring in here? As in can AI ever truly feel?
12/04/2024, 18:50 - Prasad Crypt: yess...in the end all will be done.

there is a beautiful story by asimov called the last question. (spoiler alert) in the end AI says - let there be light 😅...i mean if ai takes over role of god, what remains
12/04/2024, 18:50 - Sthit AI Group: Beautiful story
12/04/2024, 18:50 - Sthit AI Group: Interesting, so tooling,  not the creator ?
12/04/2024, 18:51 - Divya Tak: that's where I am
12/04/2024, 18:51 - Sthit AI Group: I have no strong opinions here. Everyday is evolving, so I am still learning and lost tbh
12/04/2024, 18:53 - Prasad Crypt: i am looking forward to ai messiah, like ai based religion 🙆🏻‍♂️,,,it will be fun to see
12/04/2024, 18:54 - Sthit AI Group: Let's see. Interesting times
12/04/2024, 19:01 - Rohan Ramanna: I am like 5k images deep using mj - and I am constantly inspired by it - so it means something to me - but my prompts are very specific and use 5-10 artists names within it
12/04/2024, 19:02 - Divya Tak: ha but its different na, youre not consuming it as the end point, you're using it to fuel. Literally rn working on some images in Midj :P
12/04/2024, 19:02 - Rohan Ramanna: So I dunno if it’s the combo of the artists I like - or what - but how mj composes a shot and the colours it’s use - makes me feel something
12/04/2024, 19:03 - Rohan Ramanna: I would put some of these generations up as art - but being a son of an animator - and a person who practices drawing and digital painting also / I myself am conflicted haha
12/04/2024, 19:04 - Rohan Ramanna: Music being my primary source of income - maybe I feel differently about this - I don’t know at this stage if I would actively put a playlist of ai generated music on to be entertained - in my current state of mind I am just doing research
12/04/2024, 19:05 - Rohan Ramanna: Art in my house ***
12/04/2024, 19:05 - Rohan Ramanna: Haha I guess these type of introspections - says a lot about oneself 😅
12/04/2024, 19:06 - Rohan Ramanna: But being brutally honest in hopes to understand the whole paradigm shift
12/04/2024, 19:18 - +91 91585 40496: The artwork looks like Midjourney V2 or V3
12/04/2024, 20:15 - Arvind Bac: I think what works further in AI's favour, is we, by Nature, don't miss what we aren't used to. The generations of the future, will never have experienced the human creation process. So, would they miss it at all?
12/04/2024, 20:15 - Rohan Ramanna: Yes I agree with this - WE are nostalgic- our offspring might not care 🤷🏾‍♂️
12/04/2024, 20:21 - Prasad Crypt: true. some of us already consider the old practice of farming by use of animals as barbaric, after 400 years maybe they will think practice of entering audio samples in daw manually and adjusting gain and pitch as barbaric!
12/04/2024, 20:24 - Rohan Ramanna: That said - even after photographs came out - there are still some who choose to become traditional portrait artists
12/04/2024, 20:24 - Rohan Ramanna: That same percentage of the population will continue to be curious about past cultures I am sure <This message was edited>
12/04/2024, 20:25 - Prasad Crypt: yea..like mummies and kings there might be documentary about you who knows!
12/04/2024, 20:27 - Arvind Bac: I think a small difference I see (although with a massive repercussion), as from constant conversations with other creators I'm having, is that the persistence needed in creating - that test to human curiosity, endurance and tenacity - has been outsourced now...

Don't mistake this as saying creativity wouldn't exist. That's different... we can make babies in test tubes, but is it fun? (Risking this metaphor, try not to judge me for this :) trying to make it basic and personal)
12/04/2024, 20:28 - Arvind Bac: Yes, although it would become a privilege to be able to do that... I think
12/04/2024, 20:29 - Rohan Ramanna: Haha again - I agree - I create to express what words cannot - I don’t think I would gain the same catharsis and therapeutic result if I generated everything
12/04/2024, 20:30 - Rohan Ramanna: Ai generation - definitely leads to some dopamine release , but as for this I - I am not able to see how Ai would affect this
12/04/2024, 20:30 - Arvind Bac: Yes. Catharsis. In fact I wonder about repercussions on mental health because of it as well. But I'm still getting my head around those thoughts.
12/04/2024, 20:31 - Rohan Ramanna: I guess the creators started to create for the purpose of creation - the fact that we need to use these skills to generate money makes us forget why we do it in the first place
12/04/2024, 20:32 - Rohan Ramanna: So I would still create - and will keep creating - maybe not be able to generate enough money to live off it - but hoping we can figure out a way to adapt this whole money system
12/04/2024, 21:32 - Sthit AI Group: Makes sense
12/04/2024, 21:34 - Sthit AI Group: Mental health repercussions in what way ? What's stopping someone from cathartic  creation, just because, say AI can do it as well?
12/04/2024, 21:40 - Rohan Ramanna: Well - for one I know loads of artists - both visual and aural that feel extremely worrisome about the future - they feel betrayed in some way by the creators of these models - however for those who’s survival depends on selling thier art - this makes it even harder for them to pay rent and buy food - thus breaking the cycle of creating art to begin with
12/04/2024, 21:42 - Rohan Ramanna: For those privileged enough to find other forms of income - I am sure those will continue to create whenever they can - but I already know of many suicide cases due to this
12/04/2024, 21:42 - Rohan Ramanna: More so visual artists than musicians as of now
12/04/2024, 21:42 - Rohan Ramanna: Sorry if this got a bit heavy !
12/04/2024, 21:44 - Rohan Ramanna: I just hope we can find a way where both ai can be developed and a whole bunch of people will not not be so screwed by it 😅
12/04/2024, 21:45 - Hasan: Can you share any documentation for these cases. You can share in DM if it’s too heavy for the group.
12/04/2024, 21:45 - Sthit AI Group: Collaboration, AI Human collaboration. And specialised human only created content. 

I see no other way, outside of regulation and the above
12/04/2024, 21:46 - Sthit AI Group: ^
12/04/2024, 21:46 - Sthit AI Group: It is as important a topic as it can get. Heavy or not. So I resonate 🙏
12/04/2024, 21:47 - Rohan Ramanna: Sure
12/04/2024, 21:49 - Rohan Ramanna: Also on the other side - if anyone is active on the Midjourney forums - many developers have faced death threats themselves - I am sure there is a lot of anxiety caused there also
12/04/2024, 21:51 - Sthit AI Group: Crazy. Not aligned with taking life. Others or one's own.
12/04/2024, 21:52 - Rohan Ramanna: Yep around when v4 was coming out - on one of the “office hours” this was a big topic
12/04/2024, 21:52 - Rohan Ramanna: Midjourney v4
12/04/2024, 21:54 - Rohan Ramanna: Ya - artists are sadly so devalued, they are already at a tough mental state to begin with
12/04/2024, 21:55 - Sthit AI Group: I will just say one thing. 

Creativity is a gift all creatives have, and there are ways out to proceed in life, I am sure, rather than commit acts, which even we as a species don't understand all the ramifications of. 

All I will say.

Talking in the context of death(others or one's own)
12/04/2024, 21:55 - Arvind Bac: Agree.. I didn't address Catharsis as an individual step btw... Also, It was a nod to another message's reference.

What I'm referring to is the entire process of physically indulging the senses and the body as a tool and what it gives. Especially when pitted against challenges and to overcome it. The necessity reduces in the scenarios we discuss (machine creation) - and that'll effect this tool of ours.. The body. Because we are trained to do things that necessitate action. The more we see ourselves indulging lesser of our physical abilities, the more the health of the mind would suffer. This isn't against ai. It is to be able to see what all the effect is, and make a choice. Or adjustments.
12/04/2024, 21:57 - Sthit AI Group: Makes sense
12/04/2024, 21:59 - Rohan Ramanna: Hmmm ya definitely
Stuff the think about 🤔
13/04/2024, 07:05 - Hari Balasubramanian VC: Good morning. Quick Question - Is AI generated ART digitally edited ( using other tools) post generation by tools like midjourney ? or they are just the outcome of prompts and others controls of the tools ? <This message was edited>
13/04/2024, 10:32 - Divya Tak: Both, depends on the artist and what they are trying to do. Most polished art you will see, chances are it is somewhat touched up. Even if it is using Photoshop's generative features
13/04/2024, 11:27 - +91 96896 96877: In the end it's the "taste" that distinguishes
Taste + AI = 🤌
No Taste + AI = 👎🏼
13/04/2024, 15:42 - +91 91515 15070: Does anyone have experience in training your own image models or loras ? Using comfy ui?
13/04/2024, 15:50 - Prasad Crypt: Taste is subjective
Taste varies with time
13/04/2024, 15:53 - +91 96896 96877: So does a skillset no?
13/04/2024, 15:54 - +91 96896 96877: and a good set of skills shows
13/04/2024, 16:01 - Sthit AI Group: Shows how exactly ?
13/04/2024, 16:03 - +91 96896 96877: I mean good work shows right?

that it's good

you might won't like it, that's you being a critic

I'm saying in terms of quality!
13/04/2024, 16:03 - Sthit AI Group: I am just trying to understand how can one objectively define quality ?
13/04/2024, 16:04 - Sthit AI Group: Trying to understand that's all 😅
13/04/2024, 16:04 - Sthit AI Group: I haven't found one. That's why
13/04/2024, 16:04 - +91 96896 96877: by simply looking at it how is it so difficult

A creative director mostly have a taste that defines a creative language right

but it doesn't have anything to do with the tools he'd be using
13/04/2024, 16:05 - +91 96896 96877: you haven't found what?
13/04/2024, 16:05 - Sthit AI Group: An objective definition of quality
13/04/2024, 16:06 - +91 96896 96877: what do you think about the quality of work here:
https://www.instagram.com/p/C4aH04JSWSa/
13/04/2024, 16:06 - Prasad Crypt: Agree. it doesn't exist 🤷‍♂️
13/04/2024, 16:06 - +91 96896 96877: fair enough
13/04/2024, 16:06 - +91 96896 96877: there's no set of rules
13/04/2024, 16:06 - Sthit AI Group: I don't know enough to comment frankly
13/04/2024, 16:07 - +91 96896 96877: sure sure
13/04/2024, 16:08 - Sthit AI Group: All I am saying is, Van Gogh for example, and his artwork,  during his life, would have been classified as bad art know? Didn't he get all the recognition posthumously?
13/04/2024, 16:09 - +91 96896 96877: isn't that pure art?

are we talking about pure art?
coz trust me if you've been to van gogh museum in Amsterdam (I've been there)

it'll change your mind it was so good
13/04/2024, 16:10 - +91 96896 96877: and this is also not the best example but I get what you're saying
13/04/2024, 16:10 - Sthit AI Group: I have seen his artwork in person, and I agree it's fascinating and amazing
13/04/2024, 16:10 - +91 96896 96877: it's the recognition you're talking about
13/04/2024, 16:10 - Sthit AI Group: My point is during his life it wasn't recognised as such was it ?
13/04/2024, 16:10 - +91 96896 96877: exactly so that means he had a decent taste
13/04/2024, 16:10 - +91 96896 96877: i have a good taste
if i my work doesn't get recognised 

doesn't mean the quality of my work is bad
13/04/2024, 16:10 - +91 96896 96877: right
13/04/2024, 16:11 - +91 96896 96877: for example even if you get a set of prompts to generate an image
and you have a bad taste
trust me you're going to have a very hard time creating quality stuff
13/04/2024, 16:12 - Sthit AI Group: Some people like red peppers some people don't, does that make red peppers bad or good taste ?
13/04/2024, 16:12 - +91 96896 96877: okay i think it's the word "taste" for you literally
13/04/2024, 16:12 - Sthit AI Group: No
13/04/2024, 16:13 - Sthit AI Group: Taste as in preference, modality is irrelevant

13/04/2024, 16:13 - +91 96896 96877: what's your taste
13/04/2024, 16:14 - +91 96896 96877: :D
13/04/2024, 16:14 - Sthit AI Group: I haven't heard DJ Mukesh
13/04/2024, 16:14 - Sthit AI Group: Who is this ?
13/04/2024, 16:14 - +91 96896 96877: you didn't get my point
13/04/2024, 16:14 - +91 96896 96877: anyways
13/04/2024, 16:14 - Sthit AI Group: What's your point ?
13/04/2024, 16:14 - +91 96896 96877: quality of music
production quality
13/04/2024, 16:15 - +91 96896 96877: song can be bad
13/04/2024, 16:15 - +91 96896 96877: or good
13/04/2024, 16:15 - +91 96896 96877: blurry lines
13/04/2024, 16:15 - Sthit AI Group: Depending on personal preference. Yes
13/04/2024, 16:15 - Sthit AI Group: My question is deeper. How much of that personal preference is societal conditioning ?
13/04/2024, 16:15 - Sthit AI Group: Without one  being aware, that's the case
13/04/2024, 16:15 - +91 96896 96877: now that's psychology you're talking about
13/04/2024, 16:16 - +91 96896 96877: you can't make something that can be liked by everyone
13/04/2024, 16:16 - Sthit AI Group: Talking about music
13/04/2024, 16:16 - Prasad Crypt: Where does one draw the aesthetic line? Cow dung is disgusting to a human but a fly would love it
13/04/2024, 16:16 - Sthit AI Group: Not to all humans right ?
13/04/2024, 16:16 - +91 96896 96877: what an example wow
13/04/2024, 16:17 - Sthit AI Group: Context is what I have realised is everything . The actual piece of artistry(in any modality) is not the key point but the context around it
13/04/2024, 16:17 - +91 96896 96877: great :)
13/04/2024, 16:18 - Sthit AI Group: Idk what my tone was perceived as here. 

I was mostly just asking. Hope nothing's taken personally here. 

I struggle with this question daily myself. Was just trying to get more clarity
13/04/2024, 17:54 - Divya Tak: I think one issue is the search of objective definition. Subjective definitions aren't invalid. And if you add cultural context to it, you can find clusters. Like an easy way to look at it would be that each language has its own subjective rules but it is useful to a group of people who understand the same language. What is senseless to one culture would be deeply meaningful to another. This is most obvious in classical music where classical music from one culture (chinese /turkish / Thai) might sound nonsense to someone who isn't from that culture.
13/04/2024, 17:58 - Rohan Ramanna: I ve made maybe 20 models on sd1.5 about 6 months ago - but it was on auto 1111 - I can send you some good tutorials if that helps
13/04/2024, 17:58 - Rohan Ramanna: I will be doing the same with comfy ui soon
13/04/2024, 17:58 - Rohan Ramanna: Can share the workflow if req
13/04/2024, 18:14 - +91 88980 20185: Check out my track from Udio:  https://www.udio.com/songs/rroMuNo1QAp4Cz8v4xnPBe

17/04/2024, 17:15 - Rohan Ramanna: Hi 👋 - I ve been approached by some very serious people about creating a bill about ai generation in the music domain
17/04/2024, 17:15 - Rohan Ramanna: To actually implement it in Indian laws
17/04/2024, 17:17 - Rohan Ramanna: I wanted to make sure everyone’s view point is addressed - so do let me know if there is anything I should discuss - obviously I think the work on AI should continue and flourish - but if not done correctly some angry artists might try and ban it 🤦‍♂️
17/04/2024, 17:40 - Rohan Ramanna: I think the powers that be are going to be chatting with many artists about this in the coming months
17/04/2024, 17:42 - Rohan Ramanna: However, maybe someone from this group who is actually creating a Music generation model wants to be part of this discussion please do let me know, I am happy to connect people so that both sides can be heard and we can figure a way forward
17/04/2024, 17:45 - Divya Tak: I think the suno folks are on this group
17/04/2024, 17:46 - Rohan Ramanna: great - do Let me know if I should set up a meeting
17/04/2024, 17:46 - Divya Tak: I also don't remember exactly
17/04/2024, 17:46 - Divya Tak: if someone replies then only can know
17/04/2024, 17:47 - Rohan Ramanna: no worries - these are initial discussions - people are completely clueless on AI
17/04/2024, 17:47 - Hasan: We have someone from Betoven.ai not suno. I had a call with suno people and posted about it here.
17/04/2024, 17:47 - Rohan Ramanna: people I just spoke to werent even aware of AI generators and they are reponsible for collecting 80% of royalties in this country haha
17/04/2024, 17:48 - Rohan Ramanna: the ignorance is real, and this said ignorance could lead to really dumb laws
17/04/2024, 17:48 - Divya Tak: aah
17/04/2024, 17:49 - Divya Tak: can you tag them @918890571387
17/04/2024, 17:51 - Divya Tak: ah no we had someone from suno
17/04/2024, 17:51 - Divya Tak: i think they aren't around anymore?
17/04/2024, 17:52 - Rohan Ramanna: No worries - this is an opportunity to actually control our future - so anyone here is welcome to join in
17/04/2024, 17:53 - Rohan Ramanna: Right now I ve been asked to create a document that highlights what the issues with ai generators in the domain of music and sfx are from a legal standpoint - my companies law team is keen to help detail this
17/04/2024, 17:53 - Rohan Ramanna: But even they are clueless
17/04/2024, 17:54 - +91 96896 96877: I know the founder of Beatoven 
If you're interested @919930341328 
I can connect
17/04/2024, 17:54 - Rohan Ramanna: Lovely ! Nice to e meet you
17/04/2024, 17:54 - +91 96896 96877: yeah it's a fun time
If someone says they know everything about this future

they're probably BSing <This message was edited>
17/04/2024, 17:54 - Kaushik Bokka Pop Culture App: I think it would be a good idea if you share the initial doc with points of discussion
17/04/2024, 17:55 - +91 96896 96877: Making a questionnaire is also would be a great approach
typeform, survey monkey, notion
17/04/2024, 17:55 - Rohan Ramanna: Haha yeah - these lawyers are smart and have been doing most of the Ip agreements in the film industry - but when it comes to Ai they are not aware at all
17/04/2024, 17:55 - Rohan Ramanna: Absolutely I am asking if I can share the points here
17/04/2024, 17:56 - Rohan Ramanna: And please do add all your points
17/04/2024, 17:56 - Hasan: You can share the brief here but would be more constructive to have a document in place. It’s hard to make sense of chats after a while.
17/04/2024, 17:57 - Rohan Ramanna: Yes
17/04/2024, 17:57 - Rohan Ramanna: Will create a separate doc 👍🏾
17/04/2024, 17:58 - Divya Tak: but also feel free to have the discussion here as well
17/04/2024, 17:58 - Divya Tak: i think it would be valuable for all of us to see how you all are thinking abou tit
17/04/2024, 17:59 - Rohan Ramanna: Sure / I cannot speak for people behind the tech - so just trying to give the people who did - a voice
17/04/2024, 17:59 - Rohan Ramanna: I can only speak as a stakeholder in the music “industry” as a composer 🤷🏾‍♂️
17/04/2024, 18:00 - Prasad Crypt: <Media omitted>
17/04/2024, 18:01 - Hari Balasubramanian VC: Mansoor is the founder of Beatoven .. I can ask him or one of his team members to participate .
17/04/2024, 18:03 - +91 96896 96877: My favorite ai meme ever
17/04/2024, 19:24 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Is this initiative from the government of India or from lawyers or publisher representatives? I have been called as advisor to the copyright office and Senate offices in the US and participated in many of the law discussions regarding this topic at the major conferences here because my PhD work is on this topic. This is so cool to hear of in India and I'm very curious to learn more of the state and goals. Maybe @919930341328 if you could plan a call/discussion/document we could all help?
17/04/2024, 19:28 - Hasan: A call is a great idea actually. Should we aim for the weekend so more people can join in?
17/04/2024, 19:33 - Rohan Ramanna: This came up as we have been in chats with a company that works as an intermediary between IPRS and composers - the service they provide is to ensure royalties are correctly registered and distributed across India - they are very much involved in copyright law and are keen to understand the tech
17/04/2024, 19:34 - Rohan Ramanna: So this topic will be taken to the likes of Javed Aktar and other people who have helped create bills that concern copyright in the past
17/04/2024, 19:35 - Rohan Ramanna: I think there is a huge requirement for all these parties to be educated and we find a way forward
17/04/2024, 19:36 - Rohan Ramanna: This is an opportunity to build a better future for all 🤷🏾‍♂️
17/04/2024, 19:54 - Rohan Ramanna: Sure i am keen to connect people who are behind the tech - everyone gets affected by this - hoping the net effects are positive 👍🏾
17/04/2024, 19:56 - Rohan Ramanna: Yes this is the least I could do - but perhaps we (people in this chat group) should chat first as I personally don’t see myself as being of much use apart from voicing my opinion as a stakeholder in the industry
17/04/2024, 19:57 - Rohan Ramanna: I have very very little experience with creating ai models
17/04/2024, 19:57 - Rohan Ramanna: Only music composition for film and TV
17/04/2024, 19:58 - Rohan Ramanna: And thus I do not want to misconstrue any information from either side
18/04/2024, 03:07 - Vamshi: I’d like to bring back a music meme in this context
18/04/2024, 03:08 - Vamshi: One of the innumerable raw and unfiltered live versions :

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=NpGfDUV-Ufk
18/04/2024, 03:08 - Rohan Ramanna: We really need a music meme generator
18/04/2024, 03:08 - Rohan Ramanna: Haha
18/04/2024, 03:09 - Vamshi: Supposedly AI Drake version 

https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=HwXbLJoTHy8
18/04/2024, 03:09 - Vamshi: Such different emotions and vibes
18/04/2024, 03:10 - Vamshi: And yet there’s a thread that ties them
18/04/2024, 03:12 - Vamshi: Such depth in it
18/04/2024, 03:12 - Vamshi: Any number of interpretations will still be original
18/04/2024, 03:14 - Vamshi: “Supposedly”, because I don’t know if the model is really a Drake model etc
18/04/2024, 03:21 - Vamshi: This song has been immortalised on the internet because of the number of interpretations in different styles.
18/04/2024, 09:05 - Prasad Crypt: AI apart, the sisters have contralto voice, it's rare, it's very low end of female voice, it's generally frowned upon since it doesn't fit the traditional thin voice female stereotype. 
These ladies just own it and rock 🙏
18/04/2024, 09:26 - +91 96896 96877: Need or want?
18/04/2024, 09:27 - +91 96896 96877: Isn't Reddit enough :D
Or maybe "Indian music meme gen" <This message was edited>

18/04/2024, 17:47 - Vamshi: The key take away from a community discussion on policy could be how not to throw away the baby with the bathwater.

To agree about the spirit of things. 

Or atleast to try given the nebulous effects of the disruption.
18/04/2024, 17:47 - Vamshi: Shared this meme in that context…
18/04/2024, 17:48 - Rohan Ramanna: Yes spot on imo
18/04/2024, 17:49 - Vamshi: It’s nice to give people a feeling for the creative loss involved in each policy decision and associated trade offs
18/04/2024, 17:49 - Rohan Ramanna: I don’t think the people in charge of copyright in India are aware of the power of AI - last I spoke to them they were still talking about chat gpt and lyrics
18/04/2024, 17:50 - Rohan Ramanna: So first they need to be educated on how the tech works - what’s out there, what is generated etc
18/04/2024, 18:09 - Rohan Ramanna: Right now I am hearing of more and more artists wanting to poison their own artwork with nightshade - I am sure someone will come up with an equivalent for music - somehow I don’t see that as a very positive and constructive way to go about it - any thoughts on this? Is it extreme or is it just putting a lock on your front door so to speak ?
18/04/2024, 18:12 - Rohan Ramanna: Anyhow in other news has anyone tried output audios generator? It’s focused at music  producers so it actually gives you stems of the generation as well
18/04/2024, 18:13 - Rohan Ramanna: Generations are a bit nacent at this stage - quite low coherence, but the concept of ai generated assets seems to be really picking up
18/04/2024, 18:18 - Vamshi: I like the idea itself. Seems pretty central to a sample based workflow !

There was some subscription gateway to access right? 
I intend to check it out soon …
18/04/2024, 18:21 - Rohan Ramanna: Not to my knowledge- it’s free
18/04/2024, 18:21 - Rohan Ramanna: Atleast when I tried it
18/04/2024, 18:27 - Vamshi: Just checked, there’s a 30
day trial thing, so it’s easy to try!
18/04/2024, 18:28 - Rohan Ramanna: ah - ok it was free a few months ago
18/04/2024, 18:29 - Rohan Ramanna: apologies ! but yes if anyone is interested - do have a look, while the generations aren’t superb, the workflow and utility is great for a producer
18/04/2024, 18:29 - Vamshi: 30 days is a good start!

19/04/2024, 17:48 - +1 (857) 991-6423: For podcasts Spotify policy already said they will use it to train derivative voices. Slimeyyy
19/04/2024, 17:49 - Rohan Ramanna: Wow 😮
19/04/2024, 17:49 - Rohan Ramanna: How do you guys feel about that haha
19/04/2024, 17:49 - Divya Tak: corporations be corporate :P
19/04/2024, 17:51 - Rohan Ramanna: Honestly there is a giant war brewing against many distributors like tunecore and distrokid- I doubt Spotify will survive post this
19/04/2024, 17:58 - +1 (857) 991-6423: I liked patreon founder (and musician pomplamoose) Jack Conte talk about his approach to shift towards the values of building back artist and audience in his sxsw speech this year.

20/04/2024, 19:45 - +1 (857) 991-6423: I'm sure you are already aware, but I was curious. Do you partner with stock video companies to use these clips or are the Getty image watermarks that we see in some of these clips an unintended artifact? <This message was edited>
20/04/2024, 19:48 - Divya Tak: What's the prompt and control level
20/04/2024, 19:50 - +65 9069 0114: It's much more than prompt. This is automated from idea to concept to hook to video creation.

All done in 30 seconds because no one should be forced to use adobe premier pro 🤣
20/04/2024, 19:51 - +91 87420 23550: These footages were generated or sourced ?
20/04/2024, 19:52 - +65 9069 0114: Yes we do and will be removed for launch. We have multiple combination of generation and sourcing going behind the scene. Lots to share when we come out of stealth.

so analyse and please tell us that both as a normal reel watcher and separately as an expert is this broadly ready
20/04/2024, 19:53 - Divya Tak: I don't know if lesser control is better for creatives. Usually when people are capable of directing well, they do better with higher controls.
20/04/2024, 19:54 - Divya Tak: This seems more suitable for folks who don't wanna hire a video maker
20/04/2024, 19:54 - +65 9069 0114: True and we will give full control for editing. 

but different segments and yes our mission is to make it faster, easier to get to the first draft
20/04/2024, 19:58 - +91 87420 23550: The music picks up at around 0:12/0:13 as the voice over reaches the point where brand is revealed. Was just curious is that manual/coincidence/or AI figured that?
20/04/2024, 19:58 - +65 9069 0114: AI ;)

20/04/2024, 22:42 - Vamshi: I want a manifold knobster that introspects the latent space of, for example, a VAE, and auto generates a navigable UI like this
20/04/2024, 22:56 - Rohan Ramanna: I am sure there is a market for this - many startups can’t afford to spend on a team
20/04/2024, 22:59 - Divya Tak: Ha, but I think creatives might not be the right audience for this
20/04/2024, 23:00 - Rohan Ramanna: Correct 👍🏾
20/04/2024, 23:01 - Rohan Ramanna: Agencies like Lintas now have an in house team that does demo ads as concept notes - these demos serve as reference to the production house and music and sound teams - I think this would serve them (agencies) more

22/04/2024, 12:58 - Vamshi: I was only half joking about the AI stack. I’ve been guilty of trying to get lyrics and then piping through Suno custom mode for all kinds of ridiculous esoterica 😅
22/04/2024, 12:58 - Vamshi: Sometimes it’s freakishly good
22/04/2024, 13:00 - Vamshi: It would be a generational accomplishment to get people dancing in a real club or festival to a Goldbach Conjecture track
22/04/2024, 13:01 - Vamshi: Obligatory reference to a track that was already trending, and in this direction, pre AI

this is an ancient random bot. i brainstormed something with this and chatgpt (3.5). i must say eliza brainstorming gave me more out of the box ideas than chatgpt. lot of it is in the human interacting with the bot i guess 😂
23/04/2024, 20:17 - +91 77048 92000: I remember having a great time playing with an implementation of Eliza as a kid back on Windows 95. Couldn't get my hands on the earlier DOS versions because we didn't have any internet then 😋
23/04/2024, 20:21 - Prasad Crypt: hahaha same. i ran one from a CD that came with electronics for you magazine. 
i had to search a bit today cause i didnt remember the bot name. there was also an ALICE, which was more advanced, so less interesting.
23/04/2024, 20:22 - +91 77048 92000: Funny that I was already 30 years late on the Eliza party by that point 😅
23/04/2024, 20:23 - +91 77048 92000: Oh, I actually was the games editor for one of those same magazines in my last ever day job
23/04/2024, 20:24 - +91 77048 92000: Part of my job was deciding what games and software went on those CDs we packaged
23/04/2024, 20:26 - Prasad Crypt: so you may have been the person who blessed my early introduction to eliza 🙏🏼

23/04/2024, 23:34 - Vamshi: Eliza demos and EFY - throwback to simpler times!
23/04/2024, 23:34 - Vamshi: Feels like cottage electronics now
23/04/2024, 23:36 - Vamshi: The print version still there right?
23/04/2024, 23:37 - Sthit AI Group: Not sure. I was a Digit fan. Still have a copy lying around somewhere.
23/04/2024, 23:37 - Divya Tak: My childhood
23/04/2024, 23:46 - Hasan: It was you! 🤯
24/04/2024, 08:36 - +91 77048 92000: Ah! I was actually writing for CHIP till 2008. But the guys from Digit were also friends and we would often hang out.
24/04/2024, 08:36 - +91 77048 92000: It really was like that
24/04/2024, 08:40 - Rohan Ramanna: Hi - I’ve initiated a chat with the same folk about a chat - can I start connecting everyone via email? If so please do share you email address (privately if you prefer)
24/04/2024, 08:40 - Rohan Ramanna: I can give everyone a summary of what my initial discussion with them was here

01/05/2024, 12:05 - Divya Tak: Wow
01/05/2024, 12:05 - Divya Tak: That's crazy
01/05/2024, 12:05 - Divya Tak: How did they do sprial projections
01/05/2024, 12:22 - Ambika: 💰
01/05/2024, 12:23 - Ambika: It’s just basic project mapping. What is really complex is the structures. They are super delicate
01/05/2024, 12:44 - Rohan Ramanna: This looks like they are using high refractive netting 👍🏾 used a lot by the likes of nonotak a French Japanese duo from Paris
01/05/2024, 12:45 - Rohan Ramanna: One of my bands played a show  with this duo at an art gallery in Kuwait - visually was incredible
01/05/2024, 12:46 - Rohan Ramanna: Looked similar to this
01/05/2024, 12:49 - Rohan Ramanna: https://www.nonotak.com @919953076613
01/05/2024, 12:49 - Rohan Ramanna: very sweet couple these 2 🙂
01/05/2024, 12:50 - Rohan Ramanna: all done with Resolume and max msp
01/05/2024, 13:06 - Sthit AI Group: TIL thanks 🙏
01/05/2024, 13:07 - Sthit AI Group: This was an interesting read btw. Great find
01/05/2024, 13:10 - +91 99102 70434: where ?
01/05/2024, 13:11 - Ambika: It was in EPFL Pavilions Lausanne
01/05/2024, 13:23 - Divya Tak: magic :o
01/05/2024, 13:23 - Divya Tak: so gorgeous
01/05/2024, 13:24 - Rohan Ramanna: Yep incredibly simple in terms of concept - but flawless execution
01/05/2024, 13:28 - +91 90228 45040: They actually said no , no Tak, and then you go ahead and tag a Tak 😛
01/05/2024, 13:28 - +91 90228 45040: (sorry, I’ll see myself out)
01/05/2024, 13:28 - Rohan Ramanna: Haha
01/05/2024, 13:28 - Divya Tak: hahahahaha
01/05/2024, 13:29 - Divya Tak: thse are incredibly inspiring though
01/05/2024, 13:30 - +91 90228 45040: I’ll shamelessly forward this to current Techfest Team so they can invite these guys in december
01/05/2024, 13:30 - +91 90228 45040: at IITBombay
01/05/2024, 13:30 - +91 90228 45040: (and then I can see it live)
01/05/2024, 13:30 - Rohan Ramanna: Apart from playing live shows they do a lot of art installations for big brands in Europe
01/05/2024, 13:30 - +91 77048 92000: Talking about Bombay. Do we post event links here?
01/05/2024, 13:30 - Divya Tak: sure if it is relevant
01/05/2024, 13:31 - Rohan Ramanna: If you are talking about nonotak they might not come haha - they had a very very bad experience in India
01/05/2024, 13:31 - Rohan Ramanna: But if you were talking about the ai stuff 👍🏾 would be awesome to experience
01/05/2024, 13:32 - +91 90228 45040: Oh, I shall GoogleFu it, or you can DM, then its also a good way to redeem country’s reputation.
01/05/2024, 13:32 - +91 90228 45040: Yes, I was talking about them, Techfest has this night event called Technoholix, which is exactly about Tech + Entertainment
01/05/2024, 13:33 - +91 90228 45040: we’ve had quite a few artists over the years.
01/05/2024, 13:33 - +91 77048 92000: Kicking off Generative Degenerate: Bombay Edition, a month long tour of Algorave India across multiple cities to celebrate the birth of the collective six years ago.

📅 - 10th May
⏰ - 7:30PM 
📍 - Harkat Studios

01/05/2024, 13:34 - Rohan Ramanna: Sure I can connect you with takashi and noemi 👍🏾
01/05/2024, 13:41 - Sthit AI Group: This name needs to be trademarked asap. Love it!
01/05/2024, 13:42 - +91 77048 92000: 😁
01/05/2024, 13:52 - Rohan Ramanna: Oh I worked with Sourya eons ago !
01/05/2024, 13:52 - Rohan Ramanna: Nice to see he’s still pushing in the visuals space 😊
01/05/2024, 13:52 - +1 (929) 343-6065: wow these guys are incredible
01/05/2024, 14:35 - Nitin | SuperMinions.com: @919953076613 - you should register any of the following domain YesYesTak or yesTakTak ;)
01/05/2024, 14:54 - Divya Tak: Hahaha or taktaktak because we are three siblings
01/05/2024, 14:56 - Rohan Ramanna: wow that actually works on so many levels haha - great rhythmic quality and also signifies speed and precision haha
01/05/2024, 15:25 - +91 90228 45040: I tell you people will miss-spell it as Tak _Taka_ Tak
01/05/2024, 15:26 - +91 90228 45040: 😛
01/05/2024, 15:26 - Nitin | SuperMinions.com: Woh dono domain register kar lo
01/05/2024, 15:31 - Prasad Crypt: taktaktak dot com is taken btw 🙈
01/05/2024, 15:33 - Prasad Crypt: and the artwork there, comics and stuff looks very much like divya tak's
01/05/2024, 15:56 - +91 90228 45040: On a different note, I just conducted a session on “AI for Kids” for my batchmates last night. Was surprised that quite a few of them (batchmates)  haven’t interacted with ChatGPT or any free AI tool either. The AI answers from Google were their 1st touch with AI. 

So I took a 1hr demo and showed a bunch of free AIs right now which Kids (and Adults) can use. 

We covered: 
Text - ChatGPT
Images - Leonardo / Ideogram / reCraft
Music - Suno

It was a lot of Fun. And use-cases which excited kids were that they can make Custom greetings for friends, or  Tshirts to wear (WYO) or Jigsaw Puzzles (Jigsawnation). For parents with toddlers, it was more of creating coloring book Line Art to create activity sheets for their kids 

Any more suggestions that I can include in further workshops, wrt Free AI’s to Show or Use-cases to cover ?
01/05/2024, 15:57 - +91 90228 45040: I also showed Bing-Copilot as I found it to be the only AI with a Mobile App where it asks Age during registration, and adjusts output accordingly.
01/05/2024, 15:58 - Sthit AI Group: Yes, there is a professor from Colorado who runs a can you calculate by hand  type series where he breaks down complicated AI math into hand exercises solvable by middle schoolers if they are so inclined. 


Might not be directly group topic related. Will DM
01/05/2024, 15:58 - +91 90228 45040: The plus side - 

I shared a Google Doc with Midjourney styles I had which covers 100+ artists MJ is trained on, and kid’s responses were 

“Wow, we never heard about these guys, they are so cool and talented “
01/05/2024, 16:46 - Nitin | SuperMinions.com: Not sure if this is something you would include as it is not AI.

I use Pinterest for lot of fun prints for my 4 year old kid. drawing, coloring, stickers, outlines, masks, even worksheets, charts for learning etc etc. 

I also use canva for quick editing/ resizing/ placement if needed. <This message was edited>
01/05/2024, 16:50 - Nitin | SuperMinions.com: I feel it takes less time for me and my kid to browse Pinterest and pick stuff. (And more browsing is also fun for her in a way). Also people have generated AI images and uploaded. Please feel free to DM me if you want more details than this.
01/05/2024, 23:24 - +91 88262 15025: just found their site in case anyone's interested. looks gorgeous on desktop

08/05/2024, 20:27 - Divya Tak: how is it going! how was the Mumbai one
08/05/2024, 20:27 - +91 77048 92000: Mumbai is imminent in two days
08/05/2024, 20:27 - +91 77048 92000: I just got here today
08/05/2024, 20:28 - +91 77048 92000: Link here for those that missed the link
08/05/2024, 20:30 - Prasad Crypt: we really need AI assisted creative coding jamming things.
that was a mouthful 😅
08/05/2024, 20:30 - Divya Tak: do we have takers for this? anyone who would be happy to run a session in bangalore?
08/05/2024, 20:35 - +91 77048 92000: We are running a livecoding workshop in Delhi the next day (19th). Maybe for the next one we can throw in AI assistants in there. Though that takes the charm and satisfaction away from algorithmically generated art.
08/05/2024, 20:36 - +91 77048 92000: Specially now that Logic Pro 2 for iPad is bringing in session players for various instruments
08/05/2024, 20:37 - +91 77048 92000: Waiting to get my hands on that and see how far the mainstream has moved along from something like Band in A Box.
08/05/2024, 20:43 - Prasad Crypt: i wanted to try simpler things, like Processing which is used for visuals, has basic ML libraries, i wanted to patch that with rothko inspired generator etc. Other music stuff also is not too hard to integrate.
i wish i had more time 🙆🏻‍♂️
08/05/2024, 21:00 - +91 77048 92000: I was part of the beta testing group for this research project  project called Sema.Codes that combined livecoding tools with a generative AI synth engine and an EsoLang. Don’t know if it’s still active.
08/05/2024, 21:03 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Chris Keifer's work in Sussex. I remember participating in a performance khoparzi did online where I had my phone taped to my shirt to collect my movement data ✨
08/05/2024, 21:04 - +91 77048 92000: The doctoral supervisor Thor Magnusson moved on to the Intelligent Instruments lab at Uni of Reykjavik. They’ve been putting out some interesting RAVE models.
08/05/2024, 21:05 - +91 77048 92000: Was that Chris? I thought that was Cagri from Uni of Oslo.
08/05/2024, 21:07 - +91 77048 92000: Where he tried to do a bunch of statistical analysis of movement data from performers and participants as part of the stream
08/05/2024, 21:08 - +91 77048 92000: But the Jupyter Notebook kept crashing 😅
08/05/2024, 21:09 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Yess that's what it was! Debugging on stage and crashing kernels is all part of the performance art 🎶

09/05/2024, 14:35 - Vamshi: A lot of music hackers can relate. Most music related ideas are fundamentally an anti-startup !
09/05/2024, 14:35 - Vamshi: Which doesn’t mean you shouldn’t do it, of course 😄
09/05/2024, 14:39 - Vamshi: How was the Bangalore jam ? Just catching up on the discord.
Update from me, the studio control room is now functional though un-calibrated.

The recording room is physically complete, but yet to be tested.

The “laptop orchestra” lounge is currently empty but wired in to the control room.

Any ideas to do a live streaming with AI generated code or other agentsy aesthetics are most welcome!
09/05/2024, 14:40 - Vamshi: I think the live streaming area can accommodate 4 laptop musicians / controllerists.
09/05/2024, 14:48 - Vamshi: Of course the recording room is setup for good old fashioned acoustic recording and amp micing.
09/05/2024, 14:49 - Sthit AI Group: Teenage Engineering might disagree :p, but I get the point
09/05/2024, 14:49 - Vamshi: TE is the cottage industry as far as pg is concerned 😅
09/05/2024, 14:53 - Vamshi: And they likely take great pride in that too, like most European music techies
09/05/2024, 14:55 - Sthit AI Group: Arturia, Behringer and Elektron would like a word... 😅
09/05/2024, 14:56 - Vamshi: Haha, you think their ambition is overreaching ? 😅
09/05/2024, 14:57 - Sthit AI Group: Behringer is like Ditto from Pokemon, but outside of them no.
09/05/2024, 14:59 - Vamshi: They have presence in Bangalore as well, through his holding company music tribe.
09/05/2024, 15:00 - Sthit AI Group: TIL
09/05/2024, 15:20 - Prasad Crypt: Daring to make hardware for music must be next level 🤾‍♀️
09/05/2024, 15:24 - Hasan: Next project in the pipeline! 🙈
09/05/2024, 15:30 - Vamshi: Much support! ⚙️⚒️🪛⛓️😎
09/05/2024, 15:33 - Vamshi: Though music hardware generally has hardware problems more than music industry problems.

Unless you put in a Gen AI model trained on pop music inside your hardware 😄
09/05/2024, 15:33 - Divya Tak: yeah! screw paul graham! what does he know
09/05/2024, 15:33 - Divya Tak: :D
09/05/2024, 15:37 - Vamshi: Given his personal background I think he’s more likely to be giving a heads up in his comment, to not be discouraged by the failures that come from confronting the cartelised nature of the music business.
09/05/2024, 15:38 - Divya Tak: its cartels everywhere
09/05/2024, 15:38 - Vamshi: It does sound disheartening though
09/05/2024, 15:39 - Divya Tak: spotify, amazon etc are also cartelling the audiobook business, even though their initial thing was "get away from traditional publishing cartels"
09/05/2024, 15:40 - Vamshi: Yeah I think Spotify is the music startup counter example we were missing in the conversation
09/05/2024, 15:40 - Vamshi: European and so not cottage industry
09/05/2024, 15:41 - Vamshi: Pirated from the pirates and cartelised all the things
09/05/2024, 15:42 - Rohan Ramanna: <Media omitted>
09/05/2024, 15:42 - Divya Tak: but hasan what hardware are you building
09/05/2024, 15:43 - Hasan: The most stable platform I have found is using midi interface to a software which runs all the brains. Ableton push stand-alone style but simpler.
09/05/2024, 15:44 - Vamshi: Sounds promising!
09/05/2024, 15:49 - Hasan: It’s just a software prototype for now but eventually the idea is to develop a harmonium looking device, with midi pads, knobs and a mic for the vocalist. A simple headless DAW which works in Indian music framework, understanding Raag and Taal, Bringing the DAW capabilities of live looping and auto background instrument etc. to classical music practitioners. I have an early prototype of a real-time pitch tracker which can also make this into a training device and performance device which understands and follows you. <This message was edited>
09/05/2024, 15:54 - Rohan Ramanna: Hey - there are some cool vst’s that pitch bend according to raag’s etc
09/05/2024, 15:55 - Sthit AI Group: Which one ?
09/05/2024, 15:55 - Rohan Ramanna: Are you familiar with em?
09/05/2024, 15:55 - Vamshi: Fluid pitch
09/05/2024, 15:55 - Rohan Ramanna: Yes
09/05/2024, 15:55 - Rohan Ramanna: Very useful 👍🏾👍🏾
09/05/2024, 15:55 - Sthit AI Group: Much needed. Thanks 🙏
09/05/2024, 15:55 - Hasan: Sweet will look into it.
09/05/2024, 15:56 - Rohan Ramanna: Thier chord bending stuff is equally as cool 👍🏾 but for Indian stuff fluid pitch is superb - I know a bunch of composers who use it for film stuff <This message was edited>
09/05/2024, 15:57 - Sthit AI Group: So like cthulhu but with the Indian music system as a knowledge bank ?
09/05/2024, 15:57 - Rohan Ramanna: Not exactly
09/05/2024, 15:57 - Rohan Ramanna: You can set pitch anchors so it follows the rules of the raag’s
09/05/2024, 15:57 - Vamshi: Fluid pitch is from Chennai I think
09/05/2024, 15:58 - Sthit AI Group: Noted
09/05/2024, 15:58 - Rohan Ramanna: And thus bend accurately according to the raag’s rather than a chromatic sweep
09/05/2024, 15:59 - Rohan Ramanna: I don’t think they have a bank like cthulhu - maybe a small set of presets
09/05/2024, 16:01 - Prasad Crypt: One day I decided to learn singing. wrote a software for pitch following tanpura to help learn notes accurately. I never actually used it to learn singing 😝
09/05/2024, 16:02 - Sthit AI Group: Realtime ?
09/05/2024, 16:03 - Prasad Crypt: Yup. With spectrum analyser and showing harmonics and all that 😝
09/05/2024, 16:05 - Sthit AI Group: This is no mean feat. Major Kudos 🫡
09/05/2024, 16:10 - Hasan: None of the current systems actually allows for the kind of understanding required. Different rules apply while going up and down the notes. Some notes have higher priority, depends on which section you are rules change a bit as well. Tabla is a whole another rabbit hole.
09/05/2024, 16:12 - Hasan: I actually use it, I have it connected to touch designer through Ableton. I find it fun to move shapes and colours  as I do Riyaz.
09/05/2024, 17:18 - Prasad Crypt: ah cool 👏🏻

i wanted to gamify, that was one idea. like say voice driven car game, so you sing a note accurately, car goes straight, if you are lower than desired, it drifts to left and higher then drifts to right etc. Never got time to write 😅
09/05/2024, 17:51 - Hasan: Haha That’s cute.
09/05/2024, 17:52 - Rohan Ramanna: Yep I am sure !!
09/05/2024, 17:53 - Rohan Ramanna: But I am also sure a whole bunch of people in this group could make something like that 😊
09/05/2024, 18:01 - Prasad Crypt: one problem about vocal training is, the terminology that helps in singing doesnt translate well to analytical science terms. like - place the origin of your voice at the back of the throat for better vocal support (larynx is not even there!). or place the singing voice as if the mask is right at the front of your face. these things cant be quantified on a spectrum 🙆🏻‍♂️
09/05/2024, 18:02 - Rohan Ramanna: Hmmm, yeah vocal timbre manipulation via formants is a very hard thing to teach when a student is not in the same room
09/05/2024, 18:03 - Rohan Ramanna: Beyond pitch - there are a lot of other things like breathing that are super important as well
09/05/2024, 18:04 - Rohan Ramanna: Happy to connect you with some amazing teachers in case you want to create something 🤷🏾‍♂️😊
09/05/2024, 18:04 - Prasad Crypt: formants...at least you can filter and see them on spectrum at around 2800-3300hz approx. but yeah agree about other things
09/05/2024, 18:06 - Rohan Ramanna: Right but how one manipulates it with a tongue , throat, lips etc is very different for each person - the best teachers custom build the way they teach these techniques to each student
09/05/2024, 18:06 - Rohan Ramanna: Based on the students biology itself
09/05/2024, 18:07 - Rohan Ramanna: Anyhow - again - I am sure you could figure a way around all of this
09/05/2024, 18:08 - Vamshi: Anyone use the app from the folks in HSR ? Are they still there?

https://riyazapp.com
09/05/2024, 18:09 - Vamshi: Music muni
09/05/2024, 18:11 - Hasan: Not really accurate. Saregama launched a competitor called Padhanisa. Yet to try it.
09/05/2024, 18:11 - Prasad Crypt: i had tried but didnt enjoy it. the drone for singing was teachers voice and not tanpura etc. Also singing for bolly songs, interface wasnt intuitive. but thats just me, and i am no singer.
09/05/2024, 18:13 - Sthit AI Group: The naming here is noice 🤣
09/05/2024, 18:32 - Vamshi: So it makes sense to keep plugging on new approaches, glad you’re trying it, even if it’s first steps !
09/05/2024, 18:42 - Prasad Crypt: you a singer? shall i one day go to spotify and see - finnigan's wake in raag yaman by vamshi 😅
09/05/2024, 18:43 - Vamshi: Hahaha I’m willing to experiment
09/05/2024, 18:43 - Vamshi: I think heavy metal vocalists will be very liberal minded to incorporate crazy pitch tracking effects into their aesthetics
09/05/2024, 18:44 - Vamshi: So it makes for a ripe collab with them
09/05/2024, 18:44 - Vamshi: Heavy rendition of Yaman with ace studio!
09/05/2024, 18:45 - Vamshi: Ace studio to prototype before we find a real vocalist who’s a willing victim 😅
09/05/2024, 18:59 - Hasan: Here is raag Yaman in house music we did a while ago https://youtu.be/tjkIASRorQs?si=CPlgQwMQ99ac06lY <This message was edited>
09/05/2024, 19:03 - Prasad Crypt: wow. esp loved 1 minute to 1 min 30 seconds patch 🙌🏻
09/05/2024, 19:29 - Hasan: Thank you, the vocal is my music teacher from kota and the music is by an amazing producer and friend from Kota.
09/05/2024, 19:38 - Vamshi: It’s quite danceable too ! 🎉

10/05/2024, 13:33 - Vamshi: Eleven Labs makes improvements to music gen including singing voice.

Apparently better than udio.
10/05/2024, 13:34 - Vamshi: https://x.com/elevenlabsio/status/1788628171044053386
10/05/2024, 13:34 - Rohan Ramanna: We use this to switch voices for characters in basic animatics
10/05/2024, 13:34 - Rohan Ramanna: Have been using things like this and kits.ai
10/05/2024, 13:35 - Rohan Ramanna: One actor - multiple voices
10/05/2024, 13:35 - Rohan Ramanna: Not for public release but pre production stuff - very useful in that realm
10/05/2024, 13:35 - Divya Tak: how production close is it?
10/05/2024, 13:35 - Rohan Ramanna: Honestly quite close
10/05/2024, 13:36 - Rohan Ramanna: Our workflow involves generating a few voices based off the original and then phase aligning and then just mixing multiple voices to create new ones
10/05/2024, 13:36 - Vamshi: Nice! I think the music improvements are new! Saw this posted last night by them.
10/05/2024, 13:36 - Rohan Ramanna: Voice to voice is killer now
10/05/2024, 13:37 - Rohan Ramanna: Ace studio is another amazing thing that might take our jobs lol
10/05/2024, 13:37 - Vamshi: Still no one has an incentive to release an open model with enough support to roll your own singing app
10/05/2024, 13:37 - Rohan Ramanna: Rvc ?
10/05/2024, 13:37 - Vamshi: It’s just transfer
10/05/2024, 13:37 - Vamshi: Doesn’t generate
10/05/2024, 13:37 - Rohan Ramanna: Right right
10/05/2024, 13:38 - Rohan Ramanna: Honestly though - that’s the main topic of discussion with these copywrite people
10/05/2024, 13:39 - Rohan Ramanna: Udio etc has listed thier dataset as “proprietary” and thus not open to the public - which might cause a lot of problems with labels etc
10/05/2024, 13:41 - Vamshi: I think the music industry already has a really mixed up past with copyright anyway, given the history of how sampling is the very foundation of entire genres like hip hop.
10/05/2024, 13:41 - Vamshi: It will be interesting to see how things play out
10/05/2024, 13:41 - Rohan Ramanna: Well they still want to chat if anyone is up for it
10/05/2024, 13:42 - Vamshi: Creatives are pretty central to the conversation, and not just by debate, one can participate in the conversation by using these technologies subversively in one’s work.
10/05/2024, 13:43 - Vamshi: Sorry I forgot this thread, was this the national policy discussion thing?
10/05/2024, 13:43 - Rohan Ramanna: Yes
10/05/2024, 13:44 - Rohan Ramanna: I spent a week explaining to some people why ai is important. 😂
10/05/2024, 13:44 - Rohan Ramanna: People really have a pitchfork mentality haha
10/05/2024, 13:44 - Vamshi: Haha. I’ll dm to branch off.
10/05/2024, 13:45 - Rohan Ramanna: Sure just send me email address I can cc
10/05/2024, 13:45 - Rohan Ramanna: And I ll setup a call
10/05/2024, 13:45 - Rohan Ramanna: I think these folk are primed enough to have a discussion
10/05/2024, 13:45 - Prasad Crypt: We may be the last generation of people who naturally sang. Then our generation and previous generation voices are used for training and next generation will learn unnatural singing from AI and it will branch off to something else.
Either that or terminators ending everything. Last generation in any case 🫡
10/05/2024, 13:46 - Rohan Ramanna: Terminators singing perfect raag’s while they eradicate us vermin haha
10/05/2024, 13:47 - Divya Tak: all generations of humanity have had fascination with rapture
10/05/2024, 13:47 - Divya Tak: and conviction that it will arrive in their lifetime
10/05/2024, 13:48 - Vamshi: Drum machines didn’t replace drummers, but some drummers stared using drum machines to make techno
10/05/2024, 13:48 - Vamshi: Even older example, musicians didn’t replace other musicians, they jammed with them!
10/05/2024, 13:50 - Vamshi: Yeah but I like the positive interpretation in this, which is the creation of new kinds of singing
10/05/2024, 13:50 - Vamshi: Etc
10/05/2024, 13:52 - Prasad Crypt: I hope they choose a gentle sounding raag. Like raag komal bageshri. Will atleast sound dignified 😝
10/05/2024, 13:52 - Vamshi: “Unnatural singing” FTW
10/05/2024, 13:52 - Vamshi: 😅
10/05/2024, 13:53 - Sthit AI Group: Is there a book which talks about different raags and their implied perception like this ?
10/05/2024, 13:54 - Rohan Ramanna: I am a drummer who uses drum machines live 👍🏾😊
10/05/2024, 13:55 - Sthit AI Group: Which ones?
10/05/2024, 13:55 - Prasad Crypt: I am not aware, others might have idea 💡
10/05/2024, 13:56 - Prasad Crypt: With terminators, we will be the drums 🔥
10/05/2024, 13:56 - Rohan Ramanna: Well I ve come to just use spdsx’ now cause taking an analogue machine on shitty generator power is very nerve racking
10/05/2024, 13:57 - Rohan Ramanna: But I play along to filtered beats made with 808s 909s - tempest sounds
10/05/2024, 13:57 - Rohan Ramanna: Anything I can find 😊
10/05/2024, 13:58 - Rohan Ramanna: Nord drum is quite useful - no sequencing - just great playability
10/05/2024, 13:58 - Vamshi: Sounds fantastic
10/05/2024, 13:59 - Vamshi: In this context I’d like to post my periodic call - anyone here with expertise on VAEs or other generative models to generate drum loops ?
10/05/2024, 13:59 - Vamshi: I know some people have the expertise but don’t interact much here
10/05/2024, 14:00 - Vamshi: Or moved on to other things
10/05/2024, 14:01 - Rohan Ramanna: Adding sensory percussion to my kit for next season :)
10/05/2024, 14:02 - Rohan Ramanna: So yeah my drum kit live is 50/50 electronic and acoustic
10/05/2024, 14:02 - Rohan Ramanna: Who knows what will happen in a few more haha - I ll be replaced by a robot 🤖 playing my drum kit and spd better than I ever could 😆
10/05/2024, 14:03 - Rohan Ramanna: Sadly no - will you share some if you know of any?
10/05/2024, 14:04 - Vamshi: I think what will happen is that you will get smart libraries that create “context” or “key” from your current drum performance with a moving time window.

This will be used to query an embedding of drum loops.

So you’ll be able to trigger context sensitive loops and samples from a large library in real time. <This message was edited>
10/05/2024, 14:05 - Rohan Ramanna: So I spend a huge amount of time tuning drums to the key of the song - anyone making something like this - please implement this haha
10/05/2024, 14:06 - Vamshi: Absolutely will. It’s related to my comment above too.
10/05/2024, 14:07 - Prasad Crypt: Or you don't even select. Ai plays something, takes feedback from your brain if you are liking it and move the progression in a direction to maximize your feelings 😅 <This message was edited>
10/05/2024, 14:07 - Vamshi: I’m try to try outputs sample generator which I think you posted about as well
10/05/2024, 14:09 - Vamshi: This makes sense too, and may be much closer than we think because the brain interface side is optional.

So long as the performance moves along, it doesn’t have to be the original intent of the human, the human can adapt after the fact too!
10/05/2024, 14:11 - Vamshi: I think a rig like this will be done by someone in this group already, as most pieces are already in place.

Just finding the right combination of tools (even commercial or closed) can unlock the desired performance aesthetic.
10/05/2024, 15:14 - Vamshi: Interesting link. Maybe it’s in the public domain now ?

11/05/2024, 21:37 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Yesss! I have trained and used a bunch of ddsp models for voice / instrument classes and also weird tonal noises. Mawf (a plug-in by byte dance created by Hanoi, the author of ddsp paper) is my recommended way to start playing around with ddsp. Since it works by extracting a pitch to condition the auto encoder, it works best with monophonic datasets. <This message was edited>

16/05/2024, 04:15 - +91 77048 92000: We did just that for my performance with Farah at Generative Degenerate in Bombay this past Friday. I’ve trained my RAVE models on an hour and a half of drum and bass loops and an ancient breaks and drum loops library from the late 90s called Metamorphosis
16/05/2024, 04:22 - +91 77048 92000: Drum machines didn’t replace drummers, but the techniques got abused and distorted in creative ways by people people who understood time and feel at a higher level. 

So on one end we had folks making disco that just did regular 4x4 things with new sounds or folks like autechre, aphex, telefon tel aviv and all the other IDM folk from late 80s and 90s that took rave music to different heights
16/05/2024, 04:24 - +91 77048 92000: Yep like folks like Jojo Mayer and Chris Dave who replicated the feel of drum machines and then it pushed it so far out that it started feeling human again
16/05/2024, 04:25 - +91 77048 92000: I’m gonna show you guys a real-time variant of that at the Algorave in Bangalore from another model that I’ve trained
16/05/2024, 04:28 - +91 77048 92000: From what I remember there was a bunch of research around this in late 90s and early 20’s
16/05/2024, 04:30 - +1 (857) 991-6423: actually my favorite esoteric brain wave directed performance is from alvin lucier's compositions like this one
16/05/2024, 04:30 - +1 (857) 991-6423: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Q73ZbDhQsb4
16/05/2024, 04:33 - +1 (857) 991-6423: I can imagine so many more 'not so avant garde' ways of composing with brain wave feedback in 2024 with all the incredible music decoders
16/05/2024, 04:37 - +91 77048 92000: This was soo good. But it’s a bitch to train your brain for controlling your alpha and theta waves for getting even mildly predictable results while doing live performances.
16/05/2024, 04:39 - +91 77048 92000: I remember AJ John trying to do this at one of the events at Walkin
16/05/2024, 04:43 - +91 77048 92000: Or even the hyperpop folks who are trying to follow along with someone like Jacob Collier’s melodies
16/05/2024, 06:48 - Prasad Crypt: this is my issue with neuralink or these type of interfaces too 👍
16/05/2024, 10:50 - Vamshi: Oh shoot, I don’t know why I keep forgetting this library. I recall it was posted several times on the group.
That’s great! Look forward to seeing the streams!!

16/05/2024, 12:01 - Vamshi: I also see that IRCAM has updated the documentation and tutorials very recently, it’s nice to know that it’s an active project!!
16/05/2024, 20:46 - +91 96498 60773: yeah any bci will have very little info
16/05/2024, 21:04 - Divya Tak: @919930341328 is actually right now working with a bill for AI copyright laws
16/05/2024, 21:07 - Rohan Ramanna: Hi @918742023550 - yes I was asked (from the perspective of a media composer and performer) to help collate information required for a document that will be used to create a bill regarding generative AI in regards to music

16/05/2024, 21:11 - Rohan Ramanna: So if there are anymore people interested in chatting on a zoom call etc with people from MRM / IPRS - they are very keen to understand the situation
16/05/2024, 21:12 - +1 (857) 991-6423: ✋🏼 I am interested in participating in this discussion, since I'm involved in many similar conferences with US copyright office and congressional folks on new bills for deep fakes in creativity. I remember the last discussion was to organize a call or document to collect opinions. Would love to help.
16/05/2024, 21:15 - Rohan Ramanna: Yes - apologies for the delay - been very busy at work - but I should have an update for you here

19/05/2024, 21:06 - Palak Jain Gen Ai: Hi, 
Is there a way to change the angles of an image that has been already generated in Midjourney?
19/05/2024, 21:07 - Ambika: How do you mean?
19/05/2024, 21:08 - Rohan Ramanna: Hmmm would be good to know - I have some mj v4 stuff that I wish I could use v6 features on - like panning etc
19/05/2024, 21:10 - Palak Jain Gen Ai: Like changing the axis, not just panning. For example from profile to frontal.
19/05/2024, 21:10 - Rohan Ramanna: If this is for multiple angles for a character I ve had to cref original pic
19/05/2024, 21:10 - Ambika: If you have the seed number then you can probably try a different angle but I doubt the efficacy
19/05/2024, 21:11 - Palak Jain Gen Ai: i am trying to achieve an image of a monument in different angles.
19/05/2024, 21:11 - Rohan Ramanna: And then in the prompt I usually say multiple angles, side view, front view
19/05/2024, 21:11 - Rohan Ramanna: Hmmm maybe only image ref 🤔
19/05/2024, 21:12 - Rohan Ramanna: And play with image weights ?
19/05/2024, 21:12 - Palak Jain Gen Ai: perhaps. Let me try these. Thanks 🙂
19/05/2024, 21:13 - Rohan Ramanna: Sorry ! If you do find a better solution do share !
19/05/2024, 21:13 - Rohan Ramanna: I hope mj comes out with an object ref feature as well :)
19/05/2024, 21:14 - Palak Jain Gen Ai: Surely.
19/05/2024, 21:17 - Divya Tak: At the current capabilities you can get like a 60-80% resemblence depending on how tight your prompt is. Making the same thing from multiple angle isn't solved right now
19/05/2024, 21:22 - Palak Jain Gen Ai: Ya, perhaps. Should have an option of variation where one can change axis as well though.
19/05/2024, 21:22 - Divya Tak: How would that work?
19/05/2024, 21:30 - Palak Jain Gen Ai: I meant they should create an option* sorry for my lack of words.
19/05/2024, 21:34 - Divya Tak: Yes I understood. How would that work though? It's not like midj is referencing or creating a real object.
19/05/2024, 21:38 - Palak Jain Gen Ai: like through obj ref or seeds, one can be able to recreate the same object in different axis right.
19/05/2024, 21:39 - Prasad Crypt: unless the model creates 3d and gives you a slice cut in 2d, this cant be realistically done?
19/05/2024, 21:48 - Divya Tak: yes
19/05/2024, 21:48 - Divya Tak: there is no backside when a model is generating something from a singular view
19/05/2024, 21:48 - Divya Tak: atleast the way we are doing rn also
19/05/2024, 21:49 - Divya Tak: its the same as while looking at photos your mind can understand what a person is, even what a specific type of person is, you cant imagine a singular true profile view of the person
19/05/2024, 21:52 - Prasad Crypt: sora has this ability to some extent, it is even being thought of as reality simulation model. the 2d diffusion models are really that...just trained on 2d images
19/05/2024, 21:58 - Divya Tak: rn Sora is not available right
19/05/2024, 21:59 - Divya Tak: like it is just the demo and red team tests
19/05/2024, 22:07 - Prasad Crypt: i have no idea. i just saw the woman in red matrix became real demo and read a paper about physical world simulation about future use cases
19/05/2024, 22:07 - Prasad Crypt: i hope ambika doesnt scold me for being too technical here 😬
19/05/2024, 22:08 - Ambika: Share in deep media no
19/05/2024, 22:09 - Ambika: Anyway my scold is like a blessing being showered from the higher powers

21/05/2024, 16:52 - Ambika: It’s already from November 2023 in genAI years that’s like 2005 prolly
21/05/2024, 16:53 - Vamshi: I think people have plateaued out with the pace now, it’s still the same themes
21/05/2024, 16:54 - Vamshi: On one hand existential risk. 

On the other hand it barely works for the task at hand and you need “skills” to talk to it laboriously.

Colour me cynical 😅
21/05/2024, 16:55 - Vamshi: Or maybe it’s optimism
21/05/2024, 16:55 - Vamshi: Depending on which you look at it
21/05/2024, 16:57 - Divya Tak: i guess now finally communication is not a soft skill
21/05/2024, 16:57 - Divya Tak: XD
21/05/2024, 16:57 - Divya Tak: its a "Tech skill"
21/05/2024, 16:57 - Divya Tak: "AI prompt engineer" "human prompt engineer"
21/05/2024, 16:57 - Vamshi: Yeah see, win win
21/05/2024, 16:58 - Vamshi: Humanity wins
21/05/2024, 16:58 - Vamshi: Let’s spread the optimism

21/05/2024, 17:00 - Sthit AI Group: Merging is winning in my opinion 😂
21/05/2024, 17:01 - +1 (857) 991-6423: With all this prompt engineering talk, it seems language is at the heart of intelligence. But tbh, as a music/sound guy myself, language is always so limiting. I like playing with the shortcomings of language when I'm thinking about art with prompting
21/05/2024, 17:01 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Like I was so frustrated when sora came out that I made a few reaction art pieces including this
21/05/2024, 17:02 - +1 (857) 991-6423: https://www.instagram.com/reel/C3ZDvk_uQA1/?igsh=MXRhZmZrNjY5NHVpOA==
21/05/2024, 17:02 - Vamshi: The things we cannot give names to are always interesting, and sometimes un-vector-able.
21/05/2024, 17:03 - +1 (857) 991-6423: What about the vectorable things we don't have words for. Like the sparse areas of a word embedding space. Maybe we could invent words to fill up spaces
21/05/2024, 17:04 - Vamshi: Yeah surf the manifold
21/05/2024, 17:04 - Divya Tak: that's like trying to "See" smells or taste colors
21/05/2024, 17:04 - Divya Tak: it would be like a shadow cast by a three diemsnional object on a 2 dimensional surface
21/05/2024, 17:05 - Divya Tak: a reflection but not even close to the whole thing
21/05/2024, 17:05 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Ooo I like the metaphor of surfing. David Holz (mid journey CEO) few years ago was visiting us and he also described it like that. That when a prompt can throw a thousand possibilities at you, it feels like surfing in the wave of possibilities. It's about catching waves, or building the right surf boards to allow for a more meaningful surfing experience
21/05/2024, 17:06 - Vamshi: Finnegans wake reference also obligatory here, @919881131349 would agree.

He was truly the artist in taking the best shortcut possible, to make meaningless the names that we were sure we know the meanings of. <This message was edited>
21/05/2024, 17:07 - Vamshi: To be clear it’s not a pedantic curiosity but goes to the “heart” of the matter
21/05/2024, 17:09 - Vamshi: I’m indebted to this window for bringing RAVE models back into the conversation. I think Manaswi you mentioned it previously and @917704892000 mentioned it again.
21/05/2024, 17:11 - Vamshi: It seems like a ripe place to build a surfing experience!

21/05/2024, 17:13 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Latent tickling! I love this. Can we make a model trained on just laughter and actually map it to an object we can tickle and generate laughter from!!

21/05/2024, 17:14 - Vamshi: I missed the tickling part 😅

21/05/2024, 17:15 - +91 77048 92000: Was gonna train a model based on those but have been travelling and don’t have access to my GPU
21/05/2024, 17:15 - Vamshi: This is on point. Long queued request from me, isn’t this due for public release as part of the “remaining” items for GPT4o as well?
21/05/2024, 17:16 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Ohhh I made gpt 4o laugh and sneeze and cough and cry. It's so bad at it, I love it
21/05/2024, 17:17 - Vamshi: Yeah it better stay that way. 😂
21/05/2024, 17:17 - Vamshi: Otherwise you’ll no longer have to laugh because “AGI can do it for you”
21/05/2024, 17:18 - Hasan: <Media omitted>
21/05/2024, 17:20 - Prasad Crypt: finnigans is an interesting experience. i agree that it stretches experience space that can be pointed to by words.
having said that, experience space outside words is immensely vast. its like god like, humans cant comprehend space.
i was recently reading sartre/iris murdoch/j krishnamurthy and though two of them are phenomenal writers they said the same thing - true life experience is beyond vocabulary
21/05/2024, 17:23 - Vamshi: Nice, the frog is an upgrade to the cactus
21/05/2024, 17:23 - Hasan: Yes! It definitely resonates with me. The word Horse or a picture of a horse, doesn’t smell like a horse, you smell it just in your mind. A memory of smell which even you are not sure is a real memory. 🎠 <This message was edited>
21/05/2024, 17:30 - Vamshi: Yeah absolutely. It remains my favourite because it’s the shortest path to the non-linguistic, via language itself.

The natural role of syntax is as vehicle for semantics, and so there’s this idea that there’s something universal “behind” syntax.

Joyce subverts the very role that symbols play to create something non semantic. But that evokes an experience that barely relates to meaning or semantics at all. <This message was edited>
21/05/2024, 17:31 - Vamshi: For example people who are new to noise music would often ask, but what does this mean?
21/05/2024, 17:32 - Divya Tak: i am one of those. And i suspect there is also need for separation here in different types of noise music. Because just like modern art, some might appeal to one person's sensibilities more than other
21/05/2024, 17:33 - Divya Tak: like i don't "get" pollock but I absolutely love stuff like torres' "portrait of ross" or Ai wei wei's stuff or Marina Abramović's conceptual work. Mostly because those are emotionally evocative for me
21/05/2024, 17:33 - Divya Tak: i think a lot of art that people don't get, they ask that question because the aesthetics of it evoke either a bland or a negative reaction
21/05/2024, 17:34 - Divya Tak: and so then they stop engaging with the emotion and try to understand it cognitively
21/05/2024, 17:35 - Divya Tak: which very interestingly, is actually a kind reaction
21/05/2024, 17:35 - Divya Tak: your work made me feel nothing, is less kind than saying, oh what does this mean, what is this trying to do
21/05/2024, 17:36 - Vamshi: I know, and curiously enough, my first reaction to noise music very early on was exactly the same
21/05/2024, 17:36 - Vamshi: But it was worse
21/05/2024, 17:36 - Vamshi: I hated it
21/05/2024, 17:37 - Vamshi: I had a visceral reaction of hatred
21/05/2024, 17:37 - Vamshi: 😅
21/05/2024, 17:37 - Divya Tak: yes
21/05/2024, 17:37 - Vamshi: I absolutely love it now
21/05/2024, 17:37 - Divya Tak: i have that for any discordant feeling music
21/05/2024, 17:37 - Divya Tak: including metal
21/05/2024, 17:37 - Divya Tak: (sorry for offending anyone who loves metal)
21/05/2024, 17:38 - Vamshi: I also hated it because I thought it was just disrespectful to the “effort” I associated with music
21/05/2024, 17:38 - Vamshi: I genuinely believed that nothing went into it
21/05/2024, 17:38 - Divya Tak: oh for me it is that it induces anxiety
21/05/2024, 17:38 - Divya Tak: I have an emotionally negative reaction to it
21/05/2024, 17:38 - Divya Tak: cognitively I am sure there is work that goes in it
21/05/2024, 17:38 - Vamshi: I didn’t have this for metal
21/05/2024, 17:38 - Prasad Crypt: i think we are talking about 2 separate concepts. 1) aesthetics - do i like what i see or hear? this has nothing to do with how it was produced. like noise music may contain something that we like based on our previously learnt aesthetic taste. ofcourse taste is a matter of learning, people learn to like classical and might learn to like noise music as well, just like japanese food 2) representation - how does one represent something that is abstract. i am talking about this. words can represent but they are often inaccurate, images are better but can be hugely biased etc.
21/05/2024, 17:38 - Vamshi: Now I understand
21/05/2024, 17:40 - Hasan: I have been looking into how music affects people deeply as it has been showcased in many studies about the effect of sound and dance therapy on healing and well being. Even the traditions of bhajan and qawwali used it as a collective healing/expressing/grieving experience which made people feel better. But at the same time it makes complete sense that it can have negative effects as well.
21/05/2024, 17:41 - Vamshi: You can develop a tolerance and threshold and a change in taste for music exactly the same as for caffeine etc
21/05/2024, 17:41 - Vamshi: Not a scientific claim
21/05/2024, 17:41 - Vamshi: But purely anecdotal 😅
21/05/2024, 17:42 - Sthit AI Group: Doesn't get more scientific than this
21/05/2024, 17:42 - Vamshi: What happened with noise music for me
21/05/2024, 17:42 - Sthit AI Group: Exposure tolerance 😂
21/05/2024, 17:43 - Vamshi: After sufficient exposure the shock value was gone and it revealed all the things that were earlier hidden as a result of it being like light that’s too bright
21/05/2024, 17:43 - Vamshi: Literally this like the camera was recalibrating auto exposure
21/05/2024, 17:44 - Vamshi: And then it was cathartic
21/05/2024, 17:46 - Prasad Crypt: from lot of experiences and after writing some mind altering scripts for yoga and stuff, i have realized that any altered state can be turned into catharsis or trauma release or trauma itself and much more using the right narrative 😅
21/05/2024, 17:46 - Sthit AI Group: Aligned
21/05/2024, 17:47 - Sthit AI Group: Altered state akin to lock opening. 

What is placed therein before the resealing is personal
21/05/2024, 17:48 - Prasad Crypt: even the resealing is part of narrative. the most important part probably in case of trauma release etc but narrative nonethless. neurology doesnt understand all this purely, its just the stories that we are telling ourselves
21/05/2024, 17:50 - Sthit AI Group: Reframing and perspective shift being the drivers of the resealing
21/05/2024, 17:50 - Prasad Crypt: yup!
21/05/2024, 17:56 - Vamshi: I have a similar “re-adjustment” window whenever I move between Indian classical music and pop or electronic stuff.

There’s a “hedonistic bias” that’s inherent in modern music that is an automatic “pick me up” like caffeine.

Classical music makes you work for it, and real hard too. Sometimes in order to enjoy the emotion of a song or Raag, you have to “be with” the sadness.

It’s a twisted idea to enjoy the beauty of sadness, but in this respect it’s very similar to enjoying the aesthetics of noise.

The enjoyment is primarily a sort of dissociation awareness coupled with emotion.

My theory of course, but it correlates strongly for a lot of folks … ymmv <This message was edited>
21/05/2024, 17:59 - Vamshi: Not to say there aren’t sad pop songs 😅
21/05/2024, 18:00 - Divya Tak: classical music, the dark souls of music XD (a reference very few probably will get)
21/05/2024, 18:01 - Vamshi: Oh wait I don’t get it, do explain
21/05/2024, 18:01 - Divya Tak: its a game known for it brutal difficulty
21/05/2024, 18:01 - Divya Tak: their latest game broke a lot of sales records XD
21/05/2024, 18:02 - Divya Tak: in a world where people think fast food entertainment is the way to go
21/05/2024, 18:02 - Divya Tak: stuff like that is a good reminder that humans finad effort meaningful
21/05/2024, 18:03 - Vamshi: This one? https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Souls
21/05/2024, 18:03 - Divya Tak: yes!
21/05/2024, 18:03 - Vamshi: I want to check out the soundtrack 😅
21/05/2024, 18:03 - Divya Tak: its glorious!
21/05/2024, 18:03 - Vamshi: On point
21/05/2024, 18:04 - Divya Tak: and their game bloodborne is the best Lovecraftian horror game execution i think
21/05/2024, 18:06 - Prasad Crypt: i personally dont think calling classical difficult or deep or whatever is fair. its just that we are familiar with pop so it feels like one needs to take effort in the beginning for classical. for someone who has just listened to classical as a kid, pop would take some effort to not dislike.

also in classical, sometimes aalaaps can move you in experience spaces faster than pop so i dont know about fast food reference either. they are just different music forms i would say
21/05/2024, 18:07 - Ambika: gosh - why havent you told me about this before
21/05/2024, 18:07 - Ambika: o_O
21/05/2024, 18:08 - Vamshi: Of course I guess this varies from person to person.

But I do think there’s some things that are more “easy” “downslope” addictions than others
21/05/2024, 18:08 - Vamshi: For example someone maybe addicted to doing real hard work, but it’s not the same thing <This message was edited>

dude - tell me about something interesting
llama - ancient art of classical music. does that sound interesting?
dude - go on
llama - its like coke
dude - coca cola?
llama - nop. the other one
dude - charcoal?
llama - nop.

21/05/2024, 19:19 - Vamshi: This one of those things that’s retro reinvented. Sounds from the 90s but popular with European festival scene today all over again
21/05/2024, 19:23 - Vamshi: Bordering on noise music, but of course it’s not that. It’s just harsh as hell, and the scene takes pride in making your “ears bleed”
21/05/2024, 19:24 - Divya Tak: games usually dont have noise music
21/05/2024, 19:24 - Vamshi: Ironically the producers and mixing and mastering engineers spend their lives perfecting the art of making sounds that are as harsh as possible, but that can be played at high volumes without hurting you … <This message was edited>
21/05/2024, 19:24 - Divya Tak: games have focus-ing music
21/05/2024, 19:25 - Ambika: I believe there was someone at ADC music hack who made this game that is sound only. I thought that was super cool
21/05/2024, 19:25 - Divya Tak: oooh
21/05/2024, 19:26 - Divya Tak: there was a game many years ago, that was based on echolocation
21/05/2024, 19:26 - Ambika: @18579916423 might have the link
21/05/2024, 19:26 - Divya Tak: you play as a blind person

21/05/2024, 19:26 - Divya Tak: it was quite interesting

21/05/2024, 19:31 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Yes!! It was by Suhit Chiruthapudi, a game he was developing which was audio only to be played blind, called "fly-by-ear". This was at the ADC 2024 music hack day we organized in January. <This message was edited>

22/05/2024, 23:58 - +91 91515 15070: Hey @917488247559, use it quite a bit from referencing, and creating mood boards for my commissioned projects  to animating some personal ones
23/05/2024, 00:24 - +91 99203 87409: + Using it for all the above points. In addition to that, some voice/audio stuff too.
A recent case was when a musical artist flubbed a couple of lines/takes during a shoot and we couldn't re-shoot because they went on tour (to the US). So we ended up getting the artist's permission and gave them an additional fee to use a GenAI version of their voice to redo the line. Had to cut away to some B-roll, but it did the job. It saved the artist the time and trouble of having to come back to India in the middle of their tour for a re-shoot.

23/05/2024, 17:56 - +91 81590 63404: hello, does anybody know of any tool that does screenplay or scripting? for movies / videos?

23/05/2024, 18:08 - +91 81590 63404: thx for the amazing examples ... these are a bit inclined towards scripting - has anybody come across anything more specifically tuned towards screenplay? like a digital version of the traditional scene/dialogue/character format used in filmmaking
23/05/2024, 18:08 - Ambika: Do you mean story boards
23/05/2024, 18:09 - +91 81590 63404: yes

We come from the older meaning of the term “generative” like generative process through creative coding methods or similar instead of deep learning and the like. <This message was edited>

If you apply a glaze on your images then certain stable diffusion can't see your images, while it looks the same for a human eye. (more such tech will come from outside our data overlords). Hope this can be helpful.

24/05/2024, 21:47 - +1 (857) 991-6423: Yes it's the same. While nightshade is offensive, glaze is defensive. I have been using it extensively
24/05/2024, 21:48 - Ambika: For audio?
24/05/2024, 21:53 - +1 (857) 991-6423: None yet for audio, because there are a currently a few different encoding schemas. So no standard way to work out a watermark that fits all. Also while image protects a particular instance, with audio you want to protect a statistical representation of a voice and not an instance of a recording. But folks are working on it in academia
24/05/2024, 22:06 - Ambika: I see

24/05/2024, 22:54 - +1 (857) 991-6423: I plan on participating in the future to explore out of distribution like every human before. We all want to find and create things on the edges. So I see foundation models as a race to the center of statistically average.

25/05/2024, 18:26 - Rohan Ramanna: A few weeks ago my team's music production firm (collective of 5 composers) began the process of signing up with a company called Music Rights Management, they work specifically with  P.R.O.s like IPRS and PRS to ensure all the material is watermarked and registered correctly for accurate royalty collection within India. The topic of generative AI came up, as it is posed to be a very disruptive technology and actually has started affecting term lengths of contracts as the future of the music industry is very uncertain right now. This led to a much larger conversation about creating a bill to safeguard the music community from generative AI that have unethically sourced datasets. MRM are in close contact with the people who pushed for the copyright bill that has enabled royalty collection within India to begin with, so I do feel we have a chance to inform the people going forward with this about the potential effects of AI, both positive and negative. I want to reiterate - my intention is to connect experts in both fields of AI and Music creation to have a discussion that can actually allow both industries to grow while safeguarding the artists work. I personally think ethical uses of AI can help the artist community. This is the last of this topic I will post in this group as I don’t want to break any of the admin’s rules! - but in case anyone wants to be involved in this discussion with MRM - please DM your email address if you haven’t already done so. Thanks! I will connect everyone via email with a summary of my teams discussion with MRM thus far. <This message was edited>
25/05/2024, 19:03 - Sumod Mohan: Check hasgeek's Fifth elephant topic on same, see video. @919953076613, Kiran Jonnalgadda and Arvind Sankar (who is lawyer cum ML hacker) spoke. Lots of interesting points there.
25/05/2024, 19:05 - Divya Tak: That was quite some time back to I'd imagine some of those points might be "obvious" now 😅
25/05/2024, 19:07 - +91 98103 10053: Tricky. Sampling is under fair use. There are rights issues regarding a dead persons voice: the ownership doesn't automatically transfer to heirs. Mimicry isn't illegal.
25/05/2024, 19:08 - +91 98103 10053: How they'll address this under law is very tricky
25/05/2024, 19:13 - Divya Tak: I mean tbh, photography didn't reduce the number of people who painted, only made visual art more and more accessible to people whose interest wouldn't have aligned with conventional "beautiful" paintings, like war paintings or war art is always retrospective but war photography is some of the most moving works about war one might come across. 

Instagram/internet didn't make people less creative, but rather younger generation finds it easier and more accessible to explore multiple media.

I could be making a turkey before Thanksgiving kinda argument, but I don't know why humans would suddenly want to stop putting in effort to make art. 

In my own life's experience, AI hasn't made me make less visual art (my primary medium) I've just taken on 5x the amount of work I'd be doing otherwise
25/05/2024, 19:54 - Rohan Ramanna: This topic is more focused on unethically sourced datasets and the fact there are no laws around that
25/05/2024, 19:55 - Rohan Ramanna: If someone were to use music that they owned the rights to completely - more power to them !
25/05/2024, 19:56 - Rohan Ramanna: My team toyed with the idea of just creating a giant catalogue of our own music to use in training data to create a model that sounds like “us” - we would provide this service instead of stock music
25/05/2024, 19:56 - Rohan Ramanna: To clients who couldn’t afford to pay us to commission a piece
25/05/2024, 20:04 - Ambika: Those clients will expect your service free too 🙄🙄
25/05/2024, 20:04 - Rohan Ramanna: Gives the end user a little more control - but honestly seems like a giant undertaking to create that much music - but who knows - we might end up having that as an actual profession soon 😅
25/05/2024, 20:07 - Rohan Ramanna: Clients want everything free all the time haha - and honestly we would make music for people for free because we love to make it - some sort of universal basic income in an idealist mind seems like a good idea - but again that’s a whole another topic haha
25/05/2024, 20:11 - Rohan Ramanna: Anyhow the disruption to specifically media composers due to ai generation is inevitable ( some might say it’s in progress already ) the requirement for solutions and direction on how to adapt is what that discussion will be about
25/05/2024, 20:11 - Rohan Ramanna: All are welcome and encouraged to put their two cents in 😊
25/05/2024, 20:12 - Prasad Crypt: i look forward to universal basic income from our AI overlords! i wish they pay us everyday, instead of paying once a month. Also cash preferred, and they make us stand in queue, like water tanker coming everyday! Also the AI robot that looks like arnold schwarzenegger would be preferred. At the end of the payment he will say - i will be back 👏🏻
25/05/2024, 20:13 - Ambika: We will all give two cents but will the clients. (Does this qualify as a mom joke?)
25/05/2024, 20:18 - Prasad Crypt: <Media omitted>
25/05/2024, 20:19 - Ambika: I accept this wonderful gesture 💯
25/05/2024, 20:19 - Ambika: Only wish I had her biceps 💪
25/05/2024, 21:16 - Rohan Ramanna: Will defiantly do so - thanks so much

25/05/2024, 23:48 - Sumod Mohan: Yeah, I also have strong reservations about it. It's one thing if it used for pure research and other when it is used for commercial purposes.

28/05/2024, 12:56 - Vamshi: I think it’s unfortunate that the blockchain efforts got infected and turned into a scam revolution.

Art and music were a relevant use case for it, and there were models of loyalty and fandom that were particularly compatible to a barter based model.
28/05/2024, 12:58 - +91 74882 47559: agree
28/05/2024, 12:58 - Vamshi: I’m not literate enough to provide accurate references, but I iirc, there were protocols that had “permissionless” and community regulated mechanisms for IP
28/05/2024, 12:58 - Vamshi: I feel sad to go to government for this
28/05/2024, 12:59 - Vamshi: The magic of art (including music and craft) is the permission-less aspect of it
28/05/2024, 13:00 - Vamshi: The idea of going to the depths of what you feel so that the community feels the need to protect that.
28/05/2024, 13:01 - Vamshi: Also art fundamentally admits and celebrates moral ambiguity and the “dark side” in a “safe sandbox”
28/05/2024, 13:01 - Vamshi: A way to play with the sharp and toxic sides of just… being that would destroy you in the real world
28/05/2024, 13:01 - Vamshi: But that is admissible within the sandbox of art
28/05/2024, 13:02 - Vamshi: As a therapeutic release
28/05/2024, 13:02 - Vamshi: I don’t know if I’m making sense here, but the point was that if we have to use administrative infrastructure to protect and mediate the relationship between artists it’s kinda like the cart pulling the horse <This message was edited>
28/05/2024, 13:03 - Vamshi: So it really challenges us to self regulate but without using the commercial paradigm <This message was edited>
28/05/2024, 13:04 - Vamshi: Do commerce but use and subvert the profit making motives as part of the medium
28/05/2024, 13:04 - Vamshi: If you don’t make money a part of the medium then government will turn into big daddy
28/05/2024, 13:05 - Vamshi: Of course if you play with money as part of the medium that comes with consequences
28/05/2024, 13:05 - Vamshi: As we saw with the crypto scams
28/05/2024, 13:05 - Vamshi: It’s a slippery slope
28/05/2024, 13:05 - ~ Aaryan left
28/05/2024, 13:05 - Vamshi: But if you want surf the big waves then you can’t swim in shallow waters.

Just thinking aloud here …
28/05/2024, 13:11 - Divya Tak: I don't know if this is true
28/05/2024, 13:11 - Vamshi: But @919930341328 really appreciate the community conversation, it’s a hard one and not easy to conclude.

And the real answer may still be outside the current system of regulation.

Permission-less. But sandboxed … somehow.

How? I don’t know- I think that’s where the innovation is. And it’s not just tools and protocols and infrastructure but people actually coming together, and this conversation is a great beginning to that!
28/05/2024, 13:12 - Divya Tak: It's much more that bad actors would take advantage of things
28/05/2024, 13:14 - Vamshi: Yeah, it’s kinda the same thing. It’s how far people are pushed.

You’re in a line and a few people skip the line, they are bad actors who started the downfall.

Once traction picks up more people break the line.

Eventually there’s no line.
28/05/2024, 13:15 - Vamshi: The role of the community is to create a commons (shared trust) that makes people line up again not because there’s a rule but a shared trust … maybe ?
28/05/2024, 13:16 - Divya Tak: Can't have just one line of defense
28/05/2024, 13:16 - Divya Tak: Because that's not enough
28/05/2024, 13:16 - Vamshi: Yeah it’s a nice thought
28/05/2024, 13:16 - Divya Tak: Also like crypto fundamentally is about removing trust completely
28/05/2024, 13:16 - Divya Tak: Like trust isn't about "I can check because everything is out the in open, so you can't lie"
28/05/2024, 13:17 - Divya Tak: It's more "I will trust you to do what you are saying you will do"
28/05/2024, 13:17 - Divya Tak: Without me having to think about it
28/05/2024, 13:17 - Divya Tak: Crypto tech is codified mistrust networks
28/05/2024, 13:18 - Divya Tak: So it's no wonder it is such fertile ground for scams
28/05/2024, 13:18 - Vamshi: I think there’s also trust in valuation
28/05/2024, 13:18 - Vamshi: Trust is valuation is generally the central point of debate
28/05/2024, 13:18 - Divya Tak: As in?
28/05/2024, 13:19 - Vamshi: And also the point where free market comes heads on with regulation
28/05/2024, 13:19 - Divya Tak: Free market capitalism is as much of a myth as equality under socialism
28/05/2024, 13:19 - Vamshi: What something is worth …
28/05/2024, 13:20 - Divya Tak: Company valuation? Art valuation?
28/05/2024, 13:22 - Vamshi: Both, most mechanisms end up having to put a price on everything <This message was edited>
28/05/2024, 13:22 - Vamshi: It’s useful to look on the other end of the spectrum to understand what we want to keep vs drop
28/05/2024, 13:23 - Vamshi: Volunteer/no-ownership vs fully profit driven/all-about-ownership
28/05/2024, 13:24 - Vamshi: Is it either / or ?
28/05/2024, 13:25 - Divya Tak: We (society) don't have frameworks for operating like that
28/05/2024, 13:25 - Divya Tak: Anways this is going too off topic and into policy and philosophy 🤣

28/05/2024, 20:29 - Rohan Ramanna: I am pretty sure @918003141801 could do this :)
28/05/2024, 20:29 - Divya Tak: that's not AI
28/05/2024, 20:30 - Rohan Ramanna: Ya looks like good old hard work and compositing
28/05/2024, 20:30 - Divya Tak: its animated on top of footage
28/05/2024, 20:30 - Divya Tak: by tracking and then adding CGI
28/05/2024, 20:30 - Rohan Ramanna: He could probably do a much better job tbh
28/05/2024, 20:30 - Divya Tak: he definitely can do it
28/05/2024, 20:31 - Divya Tak: to know when something is AI vs when it is not, if the actual object isn't changing shape, then it is not AI
28/05/2024, 20:31 - Divya Tak: here if you look at things, they are all the same consistent
28/05/2024, 20:57 - Ambika: I believe this creation was inspired by Prateek Arora’s work which is all AI. He told me he doesn’t even use Photoshop on his images. 🤩 I think this creator is in his discord community.
28/05/2024, 20:58 - Divya Tak: It is exciting to see for sure
28/05/2024, 20:58 - Divya Tak: Art inspired by the aesthetic of ai
28/05/2024, 20:59 - Ambika: Ya interesting in a sense
28/05/2024, 21:00 - +91 81590 63404: But the AI aesthetic is a regurgitation of training data on drugs 😅
28/05/2024, 21:00 - Divya Tak: a lot of art is reinterpretation
28/05/2024, 21:01 - +91 81590 63404: What AI actually brings about is an immense potential of artistic scalability
28/05/2024, 21:01 - +91 81590 63404: Yes
28/05/2024, 21:01 - Divya Tak: hmmm sure but that's not the only thing
28/05/2024, 21:01 - Divya Tak: in my early years as an artist, i got a very valuable advice
28/05/2024, 21:01 - Divya Tak: don't try to chase to find "your style"
28/05/2024, 21:02 - Divya Tak: your style isn't something you find, but what you cant get rid of
28/05/2024, 21:02 - Divya Tak: and I feel like all AI art has a "style"
28/05/2024, 21:02 - +91 81590 63404: That is so true
28/05/2024, 21:03 - +91 81590 63404: But this feels more equivalent to liminal spaces sort of a thing - like something that was always there waiting to be discovered or popularized
28/05/2024, 21:03 - Divya Tak: interesting statement
28/05/2024, 21:05 - Divya Tak: that also feels like, a question of where you fall on the discoverers vs discovery debate, that is it inevitable that relativity would have been found even if Einstein didn't do it, or if you think that no it was him and it had to be done by him
28/05/2024, 21:07 - +91 81590 63404: Well that is similar to artist vs curator or the opportunity vs investor
28/05/2024, 21:07 - Prasad Crypt: liminal spaces and spaces that invoke certain feel has been topic of my interest for years now...not many folk talk about it and its all esoteric
28/05/2024, 21:09 - +91 81590 63404: Not to mention the emergence of shit from random stuff - I think it’s both - some people see things differently than others which is why the duality exists in the first place

29/05/2024, 12:17 - Divya Tak: like texture in a 3d file?
29/05/2024, 12:18 - Hasan: Control-net with some tuning should be capable of that. Are you looking for something commercial/ready to use?
29/05/2024, 12:19 - Palak Jain Gen Ai: yes
29/05/2024, 12:19 - Palak Jain Gen Ai: Either works
29/05/2024, 12:21 - Divya Tak: if you have the 3d file then you can just replace the texture right?
29/05/2024, 12:21 - Divya Tak: wouldn't that also be a one click thing instead of using AI?
29/05/2024, 12:22 - Palak Jain Gen Ai: dont have the 3d file actually.
29/05/2024, 12:24 - Divya Tak: there is content aware fill in photoshop
29/05/2024, 12:24 - Divya Tak: you can try that

29/05/2024, 18:08 - +91 96507 49198: Human brain might evolve (atleast I hope) to push the limits of the Turing test because humanity craves humanity
29/05/2024, 18:10 - Hasan: Well human evolution is much slower compared to the speed AI is evolving right now. I remember similar arguments about social media addiction and short form content. Doesn’t seem like we are evolving fast enough to actually handle it. <This message was edited>
29/05/2024, 18:12 - +1 (857) 991-6423: One of the judges btw of this event is another non human identity - a digital human influencer AI team. Trash in, trash out. Just exposing the corporate industries behind fabricating human feeds.
29/05/2024, 18:13 - +91 96507 49198: If survival is at stake, evolution might happen
29/05/2024, 18:20 - Hasan: I understand your point. The challenge is when there are billions to be made, things become more complicated. It’s not human vs machines, it’s regular person vs machines + team of very skilled  people making money. Right now it looks like a  US opioids crisis but the digital opium (content) is now costs zero to produce and can be customised to each person. <This message was edited>

01/06/2024, 18:57 - Divya Tak: I've always thought these things were... Far more unusable than they pretended to be
01/06/2024, 19:02 - Hasan: It’s not far from the truth. I haven’t tried the recent models but the old ones were basically equivalent of having 2 knobs you can turn with your mind with less dexterity than hands.
01/06/2024, 19:07 - Vamshi: In the beginning it worked against me, basically it would play the sound of ocean waves in increasing intensity to thinking
01/06/2024, 19:08 - Vamshi: So until I changed my balance I used to get more agitated when I heard the waves 😄
01/06/2024, 19:08 - Vamshi: And that led to them getting even worse etc
01/06/2024, 19:09 - Vamshi: But once I got the balancing act right it really helped to be a compass to the “true north” of calm
01/06/2024, 19:13 - Vamshi: It’s meant to be a trade off between comfort and accuracy, in favour of comfort
01/06/2024, 19:14 - Vamshi: The gaming headband companies do the opposite
01/06/2024, 19:14 - Vamshi: In favour of accuracy

01/06/2024, 19:52 - Vamshi: Have to add I eventually stopped using it a few years in
01/06/2024, 19:53 - Vamshi: As the critical part for me was just creating awareness about the “direction” or sense of balance
01/06/2024, 19:53 - Vamshi: After that it didn’t add much value
01/06/2024, 19:54 - Vamshi: There’s all these leaderboards for group mediation etc, but those feel a bit irritating for me personally 😅 <This message was edited>
01/06/2024, 19:54 - Vamshi: But that little bit it did was totally priceless for me
01/06/2024, 19:56 - Vamshi: Because the whole act became legitimate after I could see that it was measurable. It disabled my scepticism …
01/06/2024, 20:04 - Prasad Crypt: for me, meditation is such vast space, not sure if it can be measured on a scale, its like N an dimensional space of which i cant even speculate N. secondly the default mode network has a tendency to creep into any fixed altered state of mind, thereby diminishing its value, so meditation based on a single measurement, not sure. 
anyway i havent tried the tech so immature to comment 😝
01/06/2024, 20:27 - Vamshi: It’s a long journey for sure. The headset is like a bicycle to get you started on it.
01/06/2024, 20:29 - Vamshi: A bit different because you are the bicycle, and eventually all the other stages of the rocket ship that you can ride it too as well… an analogy that works for me.

But it’s incredibly easy to spoil the process for others by using one’s own metaphors with other people. 

So I’ll stop here 😄✌️🕊️ <This message was edited>
01/06/2024, 20:35 - Divya Tak: Was that because it didn't have more advanced hardware
01/06/2024, 20:35 - Divya Tak: Or the software didn't have enough deoth
01/06/2024, 20:40 - Vamshi: I think that there are and will be minimalist and maximalist approaches to meditation both tech-enabled and natural.

One example of minimalist-no-tech is breath watching.

One example of minimalist-with-tech is focus measurement or alpha measurement (similar to muse)

Purely my opinion: Yoga is a maximalist approach with no tech.

Maximalist approaches with tech are likely to emerge with more complex BCIs (pure speculation at this point, on my part) <This message was edited>
01/06/2024, 20:43 - +91 96015 89795: what about guided meditations ?
01/06/2024, 20:43 - Vamshi: Analysis is one of the biggest enemies of the meditative state, so feel really really guilty to be starting this thread 😂
01/06/2024, 20:43 - +91 96015 89795: like in headspace
01/06/2024, 20:45 - Vamshi: Didn’t work for me, but anecdotally works for lots of people I know, so it’s super personal I guess
01/06/2024, 20:45 - Divya Tak: That's one form of meditation
01/06/2024, 20:45 - Vamshi: On the other hand, there are voices of random people that instantly induce calm for me, even if they’re talking rubbish <This message was edited>
01/06/2024, 20:45 - Divya Tak: But there are several others
01/06/2024, 20:46 - Vamshi: There’s so much hypnotic and suggestive depth to voice, I think this is an area that’s ripe for tools and experimentation
01/06/2024, 20:50 - +91 90228 45040: Oh I love AI for that. 
I totally loved ScarJo’s voice in HER. 

I find that very calming, and before people judge me, I also find Morgan Freeman to be very calming. 

If either of their voices were in google map and they ask me to drive off a cliff, I’d probably will.
01/06/2024, 20:50 - Vamshi: Yeah exactly this. There’s great suggestive power in voice.
01/06/2024, 20:51 - Rohan Ramanna: If you liked that you might like this haha - sorry @918003141801 I had to haha https://www.instagram.com/reel/C7cfYrDInqL/?igsh=aWY2NzBnMjg3ZWRz
01/06/2024, 20:51 - +91 81784 02951: As a creative I guess a thing of beauty is joy forever
01/06/2024, 20:54 - Prasad Crypt: not sure i agree. context creation requires thought, often verbal thought and sensing and analysis. atleast for beginner. totally avoiding discussing the topic is definitely not correct
01/06/2024, 20:56 - Vamshi: Loved all the stuff on that account. Watched until it booted me out- I don’t have Insta.
01/06/2024, 21:00 - Vamshi: It’s very hit or miss and very personal. So hard to agree or disagree on this.

As I said even just talking about myself, sometimes just a voice or a conversation will expand and lighten me, and the “wrong” one can spiral me into a room full of mirrors where I can’t see beyond the mind trap. <This message was edited>
01/06/2024, 21:03 - Vamshi: So I guess my view would be, talk as and when it helps and treat all conclusions from reflection and conversations as 100% disposable. Practice discarding …
