[2023-10-25, 09:52:40] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Hello everyone, quick question - Is anyone using NDCG (https://towardsdatascience.com/demystifying-ndcg-bee3be58cfe0) to check the quality of retriever?
[2023-10-25, 09:57:08] ~ Ankur Khandelwal: Is there any open source AI model that help me translate and detect language.

[2023-10-25, 10:32:11] Nirant K: I've used nDCG 2-3 times in my career. Never pleasant experience. Multiple issues e.g. need lot more sophisticated human tagging, harder to explain findings to other teammates. I've defaulted to using pairwise comparison for most retriever eval too — works quite well.

[2023-10-25, 12:58:32] ~ Sid: hi, i have two doubts regarding RAGAS if some one can clarify them:

1. in my use case, we have an original query i. e.  query submitted by user and rephrased query which we rephrase in English according to our domain.
we want to calculate answer relevancy for both of these questions.
How can I do that in one go? i mean one call.

2. we want to save useful chunks from the context from context precision for later analysis, how can i do that??

We are calculating Ragas scores and saving it in DB.

[2023-10-25, 13:12:21] Kunal Bhatia Hexo: I've found Eleven Labs to be one of the best in terms of closeness to real human voice. But as of 2 months ago, they didn't have many features to modulate certain sections in terms of pitch, stressing on words etc.

I've found some of these features available on Murf, where you can modulate certain sections, accentuate words etc.

Navigating smaller windows can be a lot more work. Any opinions or takes on navigating context window limitations (using rag etc) vs waiting on larger context window llms to come through and be available.
[2023-10-25, 19:12:47] ~ Ritik Madan: Langchain has a blog on this. Their approach is basically to reorder retrieved documents basis similarity score and keep the least relevant ones in the middle. 

I haven't personally tried this one though.

[2023-10-25, 19:25:45] Shahul Kaggle Kernel GM: This is kind of hack in my opinion, the paper itself if I remember correctly (lost in the middle ) does not evaluate multiple models. This behaviour of LLMs can be from the nature of fine tuning dataset. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-10-25, 23:08:13] Kunal Bhatia Hexo: We were building for this usecase at Hexo, we've pivoted to doing something else now. 

Our assessment was that this use case is getting commoditised if your TG is smaller sellers (who don't have stringent brand guidelines requirements). And for bigger brands with stringent guidelines, it's a technically hard problem but with low value addition. 

Here's a demo of what we had built. We've spent most part of the last year working with diffusion models for different use cases. Happy to share insights/learnings with anyone building towards this use case.

[2023-10-25, 23:30:30] Kunal Bhatia Hexo: It is. Especially with different aspect ratio requirements that every platform has. We even had a pilot running with a fairly large brand.

When it comes to brands, your competition is a professional photographer + graphic designer which ends up being a competition on price. And for the amount of technical challenge to incorporate brand guidelines, didn't seem like a great problem to be solving for the kind of reward on offer.
[2023-10-25, 23:33:08] Pratyush Choudhury: Interesting that you mention this 

Anecdotally, I've heard that the competition of labor vs software has better odds favouring the later - maybe that's a geography or a segment thing

I wish they said more than "AI engine makes tokens go fast" there.

It would help to know whether some real work happened or they just repurposed what exists already. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-26, 00:44:56] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: At first glance I thought there was some kind of a dedicated inference chip.

And the fact that the ttft being 2.2 seconds.
[2023-10-26, 00:47:25] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: I'm aware this is nothing when compared to what gerganov puts out on a daily basis xd
[2023-10-26, 01:01:18] Abhishek Mishra: They got roasted on /lmg/ and supposedly this is a repurposed OSS work but can't say since everything is hidden here.
[2023-10-26, 01:01:28] ~ YP: But this would be nice if they're working on hardware where gerganov can achieve even more performance
[2023-10-26, 01:04:23] Abhishek Mishra: If they actually solved for memory bandwidth and latency, that alone would bring a huge boost in performance
[2023-10-26, 01:04:39] Abhishek Mishra: Even without use of any kind of accelerator
[2023-10-26, 01:05:25] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yeah until they start shipping LLMs embedded within the OS. It would be fun
[2023-10-26, 01:07:09] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Rightt. Ttft being 2.2 is mad impressive. Ttft on A100s the last I checked was 3 seconds for LLAMA.
[2023-10-26, 01:10:34] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Also, is it possible to stream dummy/filler tokens for an LLM where the usage is bursty? So as to completely get past the latency involved for cold booting it every time?
[2023-10-26, 01:13:19] Abhishek Mishra: Quantized? What parameter size?
Ttft is highly dependent on how you load the model and how big is your input prompt.
You can optimise for ttft in a multitude of ways.

Is there a way we can check qcom demo for ourselves? ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-26, 01:15:01] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Nope not quantised. 70B llama 2 on A100s ttft was 3s. Not sure what they cooking.
[2023-10-26, 01:16:19] Abhishek Mishra: Haan toh that's the difference, their stuff is for int4 from what I could collect. It's quantized performance.
[2023-10-26, 01:16:48] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: The reason I asked was, for edge LLMs, ttft is crucial. There's no way we can do fancy tricks at prod to keep the LLM loaded and hot

Any thoughts on how good it is with text in image generation?
[2023-10-26, 07:56:53] ~ Ajay: I have a document over which I want to ask questions which is almost 32k tokens ( it's about 29k tokens ). Should I put the entire document in context and ask questions? Or should I consider RAG/vector databases? Asking to see if there is degradation as we get close to using up the entire context
[2023-10-26, 07:58:36] Nirant K: RAG it.

32K context leads to about 70-80% of context being forgotten in the answers anecdotally.
[2023-10-26, 07:59:45] ~ Ajay: At what context size do you see degradation starting? 16k?
[2023-10-26, 08:07:10] Nirant K: Depends a lot on what is inside the context tbh, but a rule of thumb, I try to stay within 4K tokens per request. This is also because evaluating longer prompts also gets harder and more expensive.
[2023-10-26, 08:29:52] Nirant K: Looking for Image Embedding/Retrieval benchmarks if folks know of any?

[2023-10-26, 09:23:59] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Interesting question. If you're building an application, use a RAG system. If you are doing a one-off project, with a large enough context window model, a context specific thing should do. Also, there is some research out there that indicates that the initial portion and last portion of the text supplied in the context are "given more attention". Perhaps a RAG system is more useful / effective from this perspective.
[2023-10-26, 09:24:21] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Sorry, I didn't see Nirant's answer above, roughly the same thoughts at my end I guess
[2023-10-26, 09:25:37] ~ Ajay: I'm using the GPT-4 32k model btw
[2023-10-26, 09:25:40] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I think that most companies develop a materialized view of their (complex) tables and then use Text2SQL on them. This seems the most practical approach. The focus then shifts away from ETL to prompt engineering.
[2023-10-26, 09:26:39] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yes, so the benefit of the big context window here is that you can try things out in-context, one shot, and then build a more complex application perhaps around Langchain or Llamaindex with a RAG architecture

[2023-10-26, 10:03:39] Simrat Hasura: So, this is what I’m understanding 

For user facing applications like chatbot, BI etc., user query is used to generate sql query and finally all the data is stitched together from different sources to build the final context

LLM applications that are in the backend systems are probably more structured and hence their input is directly data from relational tables

[2023-10-26, 10:06:47] Simrat Hasura: I think what this is looking like is 

User facing applications are the ones mostly to require RAG 

Backend LLM components are mostly transformation/extraction pieces

Thoughts?
[2023-10-26, 10:07:49] Nirant K: Very weird. I've always had 8K embedding with pooling over 512 tokens. Why'd I switch?
[2023-10-26, 10:13:20] Shahul Kaggle Kernel GM: Do you think the quality will be similar for representing long documents? With 8k seq len model vs pooling approach
[2023-10-26, 10:23:15] Ravi Theja: requires good amount of compute as well to test out 8k context length embeddings.
[2023-10-26, 10:26:20] Nirant K: Given that I don't want to use 8K long context in RAG because longer LLMs forget, I don't care too much about DPR on 8K token embedding either?
[2023-10-26, 10:27:54] Shahul Kaggle Kernel GM: true that, it's not of much use for representing chunks in RAG. But i think if you really wants to represent something like entire document it will be useful and the quality will be superior compared to pooling.
[2023-10-26, 10:29:33] Nirant K: I agree it'd be better, but by how much with say, something simple like mean pooling over 512 tokens which'd be hella fast, affordable too. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-26, 10:30:48] ~ Ajay: Came across this 4 month old HN page - https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=36134249 - for those who've been using GPT-4 for a while, has quality really degraded over time? ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-26, 10:31:03] Nirant K: We'll be running this embed for each query — my guess is compute is not cheap enough for this query embed to go below 1c/query even at higher throughput/volume. Do you feel differently? 
[2023-10-26, 10:31:13] Nirant K: It's gotten much better since vision came out, specially on time and space reasoning — which is very useful. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-26, 10:33:49] ~ Ajay: When you say "when vision came out" - what do you mean? GPT-4V is not yet out right?
[2023-10-26, 10:34:39] Nirant K: API? No. On the ChatGPT side, have been using it for a few days/weeks. Time is imaginary when I'm pre-caffeine. ‎<This message was edited>

segmind’s model is faster, then there are sdxl variants you can host but dalle-3 seems advanced. Let;s see what APIs they release.
[2023-10-26, 11:21:53] Nirant K: Au contraire, looks like SD is doing a better job here? DALLE has a lady in the book!
[2023-10-26, 11:24:01] ~ Abhilash Inumella: ha haaa. It's a fantasy land. But too many errors in SD output. Not pleasing to the eye. Of the two, I won't share the SD output on my WA status for e.g. Whereas I'm ok with sharing Dall-E output. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-26, 11:24:42] Ambika Computational Mama: i think quantitative parameters for comparison are not going to be effective for AI Images, it is really what your workflow needs. Many LoRAs might beat Dall-e 3 in realisitic images
[2023-10-26, 11:25:29] Ambika Computational Mama: So essentially you have to be aware of what output you are seeking and what works for you (aka do you have an a100 or rtx 3090 vs can you pay for mj or dale)
[2023-10-26, 11:26:42] Ambika Computational Mama: i think if you are looking to make your output better, you might benefit from some hours of prompting in the same tool! :)
[2023-10-26, 11:27:06] Ambika Computational Mama: it is really about teasing out the best image that suits your need

As of today, it feels way ahead of bard and bing chat even, the way it’s wired. 

Bing uses gpt 4 internally right?

It’s results for me are way worse than ChatGPT plus, for the same prompts.

[2023-10-26, 17:30:29] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I too think the report was a little shallow in some ways.
1. Chat may be a trending UX right now but human interactions with applications have many modalities
2. The report doesn't characterize GenAI amongst other capabilities needed for digital transformation
3. "Gen conv AI first" approach is recommended by authors despite the pitfalls mentioned in the same report
4. Simulation tech with GenAI has to go a long way before it catches up with established methods, esp for engg applications. Physics based models have been around in simulation for decades
[2023-10-26, 17:31:58] ~ Aman Jain: I think they release only simple reports and not a detailed one to public.
[2023-10-26, 17:33:19] Nirant K: Can we move the heavier compute components e.g. YoloV6 to a web server and replace with a SIM slot for network? Will improve battery life. Add speaker for voice/Alexa like experience.

[2023-10-26, 21:41:00] Akshat Khare: Hi. I've developed an agent that does that over ecommerce data. It can very well answer many questions and helps to answer a chain of thought analysis. Can share the repo access. 
If you wish to do it yourself I would suggest using Claude to parse the doc and extract all relevant information as chatgpt doesn't natively support pdf last time I checked. Then feed that to advanced data analysis chatgpt plus. It's quite good at it tbh.
[2023-10-26, 22:59:34] ~ Ajay: How does latency relate to context size? I just ran a query with a large context size 29k and it actually timed out after 600 seconds.
[2023-10-27, 02:31:01] Arko C | xylem.ai: Assuming that you mean the query had 29K tokens, the latency gets effected as per the inference speeds and the throughput.

So, keeping the inference speed and throughout constant, the latency will be directly proportional to the total number of tokens processed.

Eg: here you have 29K tokens

Your inference speed is 50 tokens/sec and throughout is 500 tokens/sec. The total latency will be determined from these speeds.

Now if you are able to increase the inference speed and throughput to 100 tokens/sec and 1000 tokens/sec respectively, then the latency will also go down.

1. It does not have support of conversational Agent. Thought they say on website. When you start using it does not work. It will throw an error.

2. Langchain overly complicated due to unnecessary wrapper. It makes hard to learn it. 

3. Some time tools input does not get pass properly.

[2023-10-27, 17:18:39] Ravi Theja: this is almost 3 months old article. Lots might have changed in these three months. Did you do some experiments with LangChain Agents and see issues now? That way people here who used LangChain can help you.
[2023-10-27, 17:23:20] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Langchain may have issues but IMHO it is easy to write (and read) opinion pieces about it, and harder to use it to build applications and take them to production. I think a measured approach where you could look at a practical problem, build a POC with langchain / Llamaindex / Haystack / tool of your choice, and then make up your mind, or share informed opinions.

[2023-10-27, 17:30:52] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: There's a nefarious pattern learners or newcomers to a specific technology face - when looking for information / tutorials on a subject they also come across opinionated articles by more experienced people who're making specific points, and take these to be the gospel truth about the framework or tech in question. This can be a motivation dampener, and can prevent us from making meaningful progress in whatever we want to learn, unless we're aware we're reading opinions and acknowledge that these things may not apply to us. To steer clear of this when we learn something new, best to avoid opinion pieces.

[2023-10-27, 22:44:36] ~ Jeff from Gearsk: I think many times the term chain is taken less seriously.
For building a custom retrieval based system, it does offer a lot. Even if a small detail is missed. Things go for a toss.
Some of the errors thrown doesn't help quickly to get to the actual problem. 
Just my experience from last few weeks.
[2023-10-27, 22:49:04] ~ Jeff from Gearsk: Tried a simple code to access some APIs using OPenAPI spec, with absolutely no tuning, things worked fine. Some parsing didn't work fine though the response was JSON which was the upstream expectation. Couldn't delve deeper. Happy to show the code to someone who is interested to check this.
[2023-10-27, 23:07:13] ~ Ajay: How are you productionizing these systems then? I know the answer will be long/complex but I'm mostly curious if you think langchain and llamaindex are both not great to productionize and if so broadly does that mean you work with the OpenAI APIs directly even to build complex RAG/agents?

But unusure around the LLM parts and would need help and suggestions.
How do i handle dynamic changes like window seats, flight not available etc more towards the logical part
[2023-10-28, 15:00:46] ~ Jigar: Check it https://www.multion.ai/ they seem to be cracking at LLM agents browsing and doing tasks

[2023-10-28, 15:06:27] ~ Harsh Goel: So two things: 
It gathers contexts like source to destination dates etc and other preferences, then goes search around it and try to book best flight available. 
Making decisions on run time is what my concern is about
[2023-10-28, 15:10:28] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Got it. But how is it better than running a scraper that scrapes all flight prices from multiple sources? and book a flight on whatever website the price is low?

[2023-10-28, 22:38:55] Lucifer 😎: Since both LlamaIndex and Langchain are framework to build LLM / RAG apps,
How different are these both from each other ?

Can anyone debrief about this ?
Or are these framework just options in field of LLM app framework list.
[2023-10-28, 22:42:31] ~ MJ: Langchain is a more general-purpose framework that can be used to build a wide variety of applications. It provides tools for loading, processing, and indexing data, as well as for interacting with LLMs. Langchain is also more flexible than LlamaIndex.

LlamaIndex is specifically designed for building search and retrieval applications. It provides a simple interface for querying LLMs and retrieving relevant documents.
[2023-10-28, 22:43:24] Vignesh Baskaran: Hi Chanukya
Ravi should know the details. @919550164716 Can you please help out Chanukya?
[2023-10-28, 22:45:05] Ravi Theja: It provides tools for loading, processing, and indexing data, as well as for interacting with LLMs. - these are provided in llamaindex as well.

[2023-10-28, 22:49:00] Lucifer 😎: Exactly

Should I think these 2 frameworks like pinecone and weaviate ?

But I think Langchain is more customisable for personal usecases where as llamaindex is more inclined towards building specific RAG pipelines
[2023-10-28, 22:50:39] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: You can use both in one codebase if you are feeling really adventurous. I would suggest playing aorudn to see what works for you.  More a matter of preference for specific use-cases.
[2023-10-28, 22:51:55] Lucifer 😎: Understandable

[2023-10-29, 00:39:31] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Define what you mean by  correct here. Correct as in info retrieval accuracy or correct as in the way you want the llm to output the answer (formatting etc, style)? ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-29, 00:41:19] Lucifer 😎: Correct in the sense 

Retrieved answer should be accurate. 
Not about the format of output
[2023-10-29, 00:41:41] Lucifer 😎: Data

Let's say data is related to chemotherapy and it's symptoms+recovery methods+recipes to get healthy

Usecase

A patient gets a medical discharge summary
Extracts the Diagnosis sections
Give me recipes and tablets based on diagnosis section
[2023-10-29, 00:42:07] ~ Chirag: If you want factually correct answer, I think finetuned model would give you better results
[2023-10-29, 00:44:45] Lucifer 😎: If my data stored in v-db and the data which is used to fine tune my pre-trained model *same*

Won't the retrieved output be the same ?
[2023-10-29, 00:46:24] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: The approach should involve fine-tuning with RAG, rather than just using one technique . Fine-tuning may not yield the same performance as RAG

This topic has become very popular in LinkedIn posts
[2023-10-29, 00:50:25] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: Not necessarily. They could differ based on the base model you are using for fine-tuning and the language model you are going to use in RAG. Even if you use the same model, the results could vary
[2023-10-29, 00:50:30] Lucifer 😎: Output from Ft and info from RAG
Which would be necessary to re-check my extracted ans ?
[2023-10-29, 00:50:56] Lucifer 😎: Yesp

I think model weights if FT will be changed and model + rag will be different
[2023-10-29, 00:54:12] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: Not like that. You should finetune the model for RAG rather than finetuning it separately. 

For example, gpt-3.5-turbo hallucinates more than gpt-4 in RAG pipeline. But you can finetune the model to reduce the hallucinations in gpt-3.5-turbo

[2023-10-29, 07:39:46] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Much of this article is based on the book “Programming Massively Parallel Processors”, 4th edition by Hwu et al. As the book covers Nvidia GPUs, I will also be talking about Nvidia GPUs and using Nvidia specific terminology. However, the fundamental concepts and approach to GPU programming apply to other vendors as well.

This is a good book to have.

I followed this mind map  which was very helpful.

Want to get into details of advanced stuff like fine tuning, working with GPU etc
[2023-10-29, 09:16:46] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Honestly if you want to keep up with the field - Twitter, Discord - hands down. Here's a list:

[2023-10-29, 11:30:52] ~ Kshiteej: That book is gold, especially the first 4-5 chapters which talk about the hardware architecture. It gives a clear idea of how kernels are executed on GPU hardware and how to write a good CUDA program to get the best out of it.

[2023-10-29, 11:43:49] Abhishek Mishra: Yeah positioning yourself right next to the feature openAI will add next doesn't seem like a good idea at all.
[2023-10-29, 11:46:06] Nirant K: They're ramping up to be agent with RAG as a tool. That's quite neat. API access for these will turbo charge existing enterprises with distribution. Great time to buy market leader stocks if you're salaried.
[2023-10-29, 11:47:19] Nirant K: For more dramatic flair: directionally, this will reduce the backend and ML devs needed from say current 5 to 1 in the short run
[2023-10-29, 12:02:40] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: RIP LangChain
[2023-10-29, 12:03:44] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Very interesting observation. There have been rumors of a “stateful API” and this would fit the bill. Add fine tuning of GPT-4 on top and that’s it
[2023-10-29, 12:04:28] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Unless they can do distillation / inference optimization automatically they might still be needed. I’m wondering if that can also be semi automated given enough data

[2023-10-29, 12:22:47] ~ Vijay RPS: I work for CaratLane.Manager asked for a senior engineer but company said no and gave him permission to hire fresh grads from college.so ya i feel fresh grads will be preferred more by some companies instead of paying a huge salary to senior engineer
[2023-10-29, 12:22:49] ~ अक्षित: Yeah
[2023-10-29, 12:23:24] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: If junior engg + GPT = you then yes.
[2023-10-29, 12:23:51] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: This is true in some cases but not always
[2023-10-29, 12:24:26] ~ Vijay RPS: Ya case by case basis
[2023-10-29, 12:24:37] ~ अक्षित: I think tou should be able to do all the work by yourself and then it feels redundant then use gpt otherwise we might have engineers who don't know what their code is doing 😂😂😂
[2023-10-29, 12:25:28] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: Ohh wow
I can understand that viewpoint
[2023-10-29, 12:25:32] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Oh yes let’s build giant complex systems full of poorly understood black boxes giant models spaghetti code and have junior engineers maintain it 😂
[2023-10-29, 12:26:44] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: But yes - the days when you can learn react in 3 months and get a high paying job are over. Be prepared to grind to stay ahead of the curve. Which if you’re in this group you already are doing so don’t worry
[2023-10-29, 12:27:19] Abhishek Mishra: Communication of requirements and iteration is important. So lesser engineers overall but also the ones who can understand people, problems and iterate best.
[2023-10-29, 12:27:23] ~ Vijay RPS: We interviewed close to 50 ppl from two top colleges in TN and surprisingly level of the engineers were very poor and lot of ppl tried to manipulate the interviews using ChatGPT

[2023-10-29, 12:28:04] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: So they can’t pass even with ChatGPT
[2023-10-29, 12:28:05] ~ Amit Sharma: A lot of this is not because of increasing AI capabilities in coding/understanding code but also inflated expectations of average engineers who put 'AI Engineer' on the resume on the back of a few git clones & watching a few youtube videos. There are many people who burnt their fingers with folks having 'senior engineer' titles. Everyone needs to up their game.

[2023-10-30, 09:36:31] ~ Mudit Tyagi: Has anyone tried to generate embeddings for code using open source? What worked best for you? Is there a model small enough that would run on an M2 Mac with 32 Gigs of RAM and generate embeddings for about a thousand lines of code within tens of hours?
[2023-10-30, 10:08:42] Nirant K: OpenAI embedding is good for code tbh

[2023-10-30, 10:48:43] Nirant K: What's the best code OSS embedding? Are there use cases for dedicated code embedding? ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-30, 10:49:04] Abhishek Mishra: Cuda 12 release added compute support for fp8 but I don't think we saw research with no performance degradation compared to bf16 for training purposes.

But I've been aware of good fp8 performance for fine tuning with H100/4090 on cuda 12 for a while.
[2023-10-30, 10:51:56] Abhishek Mishra: The best code dedicated OSS embedding/model that I'm aware of is this one - https://huggingface.co/Salesforce/codegen-350M-multi
[2023-10-30, 10:52:35] Abhishek Mishra: Though we mostly use regular STS ones for any duplication filtering for code datasets. Not code dedicated ones.

[2023-10-30, 19:42:21] ~ Bharath: The order says nothing about exposing data used to train, does it?
[2023-10-30, 19:42:43] Priyank Agrawal: Won't this make big tech very powerful and oss Indies in a tough spot
[2023-10-30, 19:44:41] Abhishek Mishra: Yes you can consider this to be a full stop on uncensored and unregulated pretrained LLM drop like Mistral
[2023-10-30, 19:45:08] Abhishek Mishra: Any release will have to use vetted data and the results would require intense red teaming
[2023-10-30, 19:47:31] ~ Aakash Kambuj: That’s a lot of room for interpretation in the order. In practice there will be business as usual
[2023-10-30, 19:48:22] Nirant K: Does the red teaming means a lot of fine-tuning is also illegal until reported? ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-30, 19:49:11] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: i have a standing bet on regulations with a whole bunch of people, that i just won after a year;)

i welcome everyone to create another bet on this - that all these laws wont really regulate model creation. im of course taking the contrary stand to this - we must create a self regulatory organization. 

laws are already here. uve been warned
[2023-10-30, 19:51:09] Priyank Agrawal: A wise person said - 

Laws are interpretable and businesses read in between lines.
[2023-10-30, 19:54:04] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: No see Europe is already a hell hole. Mistral as a company is gonna suffer irrespective of US regulations. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-30, 19:54:08] Abhishek Mishra: Yes, major releases will get vetted for sure.
Fine tuning on data that might contain PII comes under regulation, though not sure how they enforce it.
[2023-10-30, 19:54:19] ~ Aakash Kambuj: My take is the goal of some of this is to build awareness and apply constraints in concert with the GPU export controls. That’s no point banning export of certain model training hardware if the same controls aren’t applied to the most powerful models too (and their OSS equivalents)
[2023-10-30, 19:55:17] ~ Bharath: A senior official from Mistral  recently made a pre-emptive statement about regulations crippling them and making them uncompetitive compared to the US
[2023-10-30, 19:55:37] Abhishek Mishra: Another thing is would there be a regulation in retro, to re-vet or license anything that already exists. The enforcement seems to be really difficult.

Huggingtorrents all the way I guess.
[2023-10-30, 19:55:40] Sachin Legaltech: So looks like no more base model release from US companies ..Heavily censored models will only see light of the day
[2023-10-30, 19:57:00] ~ Bharath: They might ask apps to expose the models they used and thus get to usage of unlicensed models
[2023-10-30, 19:57:15] Priyank Agrawal: @917737799743 this might become a great news for you !!
[2023-10-30, 19:57:23] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Or somewhat a blockchain for model weights
[2023-10-30, 19:58:01] Abhishek Mishra: It's hard to distinguish that on the level of weights actually. Anybody could be using anything and they wouldn't know. It has to be regulated at the release level only.
[2023-10-30, 20:00:41] Sachin Legaltech: Would this push model training outside US/ Europe?
[2023-10-30, 20:02:40] Arko C | xylem.ai: Too soon to say that
[2023-10-30, 20:02:47] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: I want to think of it as mining bitcoins. Peeps with huge money and GPUs pop up everywhere and build their own GPU clusters for training. just like bitcoin miners lol ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-10-30, 20:02:58] Abhishek Mishra: EU maybe, US no. 
They will just regulate release for major participants.
[2023-10-30, 20:03:08] Abhishek Mishra: Also, should we move it now to AI policy?
[2023-10-30, 20:03:10] Arko C | xylem.ai: Altman rallied to get the regulation that aids him.

You think Zuck’s gonna take it lightly?
[2023-10-30, 20:03:31] Arko C | xylem.ai: Meta has been playing cat and mouse with regulations for years :)
[2023-10-30, 20:04:42] Abhishek Mishra: I think this has become a full fledged discussion on policy and regulations now so needs to be moved to AI policy.
[2023-10-30, 20:05:11] Rahul Deora: Underground models will increase with any such regulation
[2023-10-30, 20:06:44] Arko C | xylem.ai: I think we should just work on what we are building.

There are millions that other companies have at stake, they will push back or read between the lines.
[2023-10-30, 20:08:07] Arko C | xylem.ai: We are very early in the AI space. It’s too early to call for any heavy regulations anyway. Altman did what aids him, but the policy is very very high level. Nothing specific.
[2023-10-30, 20:10:02] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: @917737887058 is think it’s time for you to start working on that idea of building Moody’s for models.

* What happens to the pre existing open source models like Llama, Mistral?
* Can we finetune on top of the approved foundational  models without notifying the government? Considering that finetuning is a good technique to remove alignment
* What is the regulation on using OS models trained in other countries? Like Mistral, Falcon

[2023-10-30, 22:42:59] Adithya S K PESIT: AWQ is the most recent one 
GPTQ is what ppl are using in production as of right now
GGUF is for CPU based inference
[2023-10-30, 22:43:33] Abhishek Mishra: I think nobody can stop you from fine tuning but deploying will be regulated based on the country's laws in some way.
[2023-10-30, 22:44:11] Abhishek Mishra: Fastest AWQ because vLLM supports only AWQ
[2023-10-30, 22:44:48] Arko C | xylem.ai: That’s already coming from the model companies I believe
[2023-10-30, 22:45:11] Arko C | xylem.ai: Have been speaking to the folks at TII regarding Falcon on similar lines
[2023-10-30, 22:45:19] Abhishek Mishra: AWQ and exl2 are superior GPU quants over GPTQ, GGUF is Mac or CPU primary and kind of the only considerable option in that area.

[2023-10-31, 07:39:52] ~ Ajay: Hey guys does anyone know of some examples to look at how to use langchain/llamaindex to query over structured ( SQL table ) and unstructured data ( documents ) together? That is I have a table and a bunch of documents and I want to be able to ask questions over both at the same time
[2023-10-31, 07:56:53] ~ Ajay: If I know the exact format of the question, then I can get it to query SQL first or the documents first and then do the other. But the problem is it can in any order and requires the LLM to figure out which one to query first.

As a simple example, let's say there is a table with a bunch of information about different countries in the world like size, population, year they were founded, etc. And then a bunch of documents about each country. And I ask these questions:

"which country has the highest population" - just needs to run SQL. 

"Can you tell me more about Germany" - just needs document querying

"Can you tell me more about the country with the highest population" - SQL followed by document query

"Can you tell me when the country that bombed Hiroshima was founded" - document query followed by SQL
[2023-10-31, 07:57:52] Ravi Theja: Couple of example usecases in LlamaIndex.

[2023-10-31, 08:03:12] ~ Ajay: It looks like SQLAutoVectoeQueryEngine always query the SQL table first
[2023-10-31, 08:03:23] ~ Ajay: table(s)

So far what I've been doing is getting the LLM to understand a specific type of question and how to process that. This is always document search first followed by SQL at the end and how to know which parts to query the document store first. But it doesn't generalize well so looking for alternate ways to do it.
[2023-10-31, 08:09:48] ~ Unni Krishnan: For querying etc I like the suggestions given by @919550164716. Along with this some guardrails for some validations etc.
[2023-10-31, 08:10:47] ~ Unni Krishnan: We might have to programmatically find the sequence of execution and make seperate calls to structured data and unstructured
[2023-10-31, 08:12:41] ~ Ajay: What do you mean by progrmatically? Make a query plan of sorts using the LLM itself first?
[2023-10-31, 08:15:29] ~ Unni Krishnan: Just bouncing some ideas
1. Classify question using LLM
2. Based on classification execute a relevant strategy

Or execute and check the response and take a call to go either structured or unstructured if the response is not satisfactory
[2023-10-31, 08:32:57] ~ Sahas: Can we classify based on embeddings instead of gpt call?
[2023-10-31, 08:35:56] ~ Ajay: How do I do that?
[2023-10-31, 08:54:40] ~ Sahas: I didn't try it out yet. 

 Like we ask LLM to classify whether the given question is of typeA or typeB,

 We can have Embeddings for typeA, typeB along with description & retrieve the most similar embedding for the given query.
[2023-10-31, 08:55:00] ~ Sahas: Did anyone try this approach?

[2023-10-31, 09:57:06] ~ prakashkagitha: Atleast for the example of “tell me about the history of Berlin”, it only used vector_search tool. I am assuming SQLAutoVectorQueryEngine works as agents choosing which tool to use as we defined the two capabilities as tools rather than specific steps.

We built a similar solution with LangChain agents and defining SQL and text queries as tools. It was the same case there as well, we won’t define which step to take first. Agent should ideally discern that, for our use case we had to give few-shot examples as well, as its health domain not general domain.
[2023-10-31, 10:04:07] ~ Ajay: I meant to say the reverse order - document first then SQL second isn't possible. It either does SQL first then document or just document, not document search the SQL.
[2023-10-31, 10:06:50] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: Tried a new approach a while back for this

Create two langchain agents, one to index data and one to write the pandas code for visual/data processing

this makes agents more reliable

Here’s the link for implementation in LangChain

[2023-10-31, 11:18:21] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: I haven’t tried it myself,but the example and your queries are same in the way that it needs intermediate steps of fetching information to find the final answer
[2023-10-31, 11:20:29] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Downside of using this with LangChain is that agent implementations are costlier to run.

[2023-10-31, 13:00:32] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Most companies are still in POC mode like this since generative AI and langchain are still recent developments. That said some of the conversations I see here on this group are by truly expert level teams building applications and products with generative AI
[2023-10-31, 13:02:43] ~ Unni Krishnan: Totally, I feel overwhelmed sometimes reading about stuff in the group.
Folks already having knowledge of NLP or deep learning have a headstart at least on the theory of things

Yet beats it in all 3 category
[2023-10-31, 13:37:37] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Read earlier on LinkedIn about this paper, that the GPT 3.5 turbo model's parameter count being 20B indicates good quantization - given the performance (latency) and the quality of the responses.
[2023-10-31, 13:38:59] Nirant K: Quick tips on doing RAG better:

1. Retrieval and ranking matter quite a lot:

1a) Chunking: Including section title in your chunks improves that, so does keywords from the documents
1b) Different token-efficient separators in your chunks e.g. ### is a single token in GPT family of models
1c) Latency permitting — use a ReRanker — Cohere, Sentence Transformers and BGE have decent ones
1d) If you can, finetune the embedding to your domain — takes about 20 minutes on a modern laptop or Colab notebook, improves recall by upto 30-50%

2.  Use the right embedding for the right problem: GTE, BGE are best for most support, sales, and FAQ kind of applications. OpenAI is the easiest for Code Embedding to use. e5 family does better on non-English and Chinese languages
3.  Evaluation Driven Development makes your entire "dev" iteration much faster. Think of these as the "running the code to see if it works". We've Ragas folks, @919446220252 and @917025755203 who can help you evaluate this. They also have a Langchain integration and were on the Langchain podcast as well.
4.  Vector Store: When you're hitting latency and throughput limits on the Vector Store, consider using scalar quantization with a real vector store like Qdrant or Weaviate. Chroma is not a vector store, it's marketing from SF
5.  Frameworks: Langchain and Llama Index are both decent and implement a reasonable number of querying approaches, they improve recall and precision both depending on the params selected. How to select params? See point #3 on eval
6.  LLM: OpenAI GPT3.5 will often do better or as good as GPT4 with finetuning. Needs about 100 records to get the 30% latency improvements too, so quite often worth the time.
[2023-10-31, 13:39:31] Nirant K: (Sorry for the wall of text, wanted to have it all in one place for ease of reading for those interested in RAG)

[2023-10-31, 14:37:06] Dhruv Anand: basic question: is GPT4-V anything more than the upload images button on chatgpt plus’s GPT-4 mode? Is there any new functionality/access expected to be released (other than API)?
[2023-10-31, 14:57:49] Vignesh Baskaran: I have a collection of unstructured data files in formats such as HTML, Markdown, PDF, and code files. My goal is to parse this data and segment it into distinct sections for RAG. I've experimented with the open-source library from Unstructured-IO and achieved Okish results. Are there any other libraries or APIs you can recommend for this purpose?
[2023-10-31, 15:04:42] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Have you looked at NLTK Text Splitter? Or am I suggesting something you tried which didn't work?
[2023-10-31, 15:04:57] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: SpaCy also has a text splitter which can be used for similar tasks
[2023-10-31, 15:05:33] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: These are bound to be better than basic fixed-length splitters, because they may be content aware, being in NLP libraries

[2023-10-31, 16:51:48] Nirant K: Yes, translation to and from English is what @19377081307 of KissanAI also uses. They've done 350K queries in last 6 months and on a shoe string budget
[2023-10-31, 16:52:01] Ojasvi Yadav: Let's say you're creating yet another hiring RAG that matches employers to potential employees

"IT" and "it" would be considered as the same thing for a base model. That base model wouldn't consider "IT" and "Apple" too close

But if you were to fine-tune it, then "IT" and "Apple" would be considered similar because both are tech related terms
[2023-10-31, 16:52:25] Ojasvi Yadav: IT being information technologies, and Apple being the company apple
[2023-10-31, 16:52:51] Nirant K: Excellent example!

[2023-10-31, 16:57:45] ~ Nj: Right, so then the question is how are people going about this translation, there are rule based libraries, there are things like Google translate api, and then to other extreme you can use multilingual LLM in a translation chain
[2023-10-31, 16:59:50] Nirant K: Llama Index has a blog on generating synthetic data from your domain using a LLM, and then using that to finetune your embedding.

couple of q.s

2. For users, who have to read through a lot of presentations(VCs, award committees, etc)
Is there a market for a tool that summarizes presentations ?

Came across this today. Good initiative on assembling information from source though because it relies on 'self-reporting', the disclaimer on no legal advice dilutes it a bit
[2023-10-31, 19:03:37] Sumanth Raghavendra: 1. Are most of your paying customers outside India? Do you think Indian users would be willing to pay for a product like this ?

We made $50k this month - completely self-serve, unaided purchases...we don't even have anyone in sales or marketing. So clearly, there is something that customers are finding valuable. Yes, we have many Indian customers too (overseas is of course definitely higher though).

2. For users, who have to read through a lot of presentations(VCs, award committees, etc). Is there a market for a tool that summarizes presentations?

We see the market as being a lot bigger than just for those who read through a lot of presentations or require summaries. Every high-value business use case has a presentation interspersed somewhere in the mix but today PowerPoint is where knowledge goes to die. We believe that we can make presentations a first class citizen amongst systems of records - and that will open up a number of market opportunities - both as input and output artifacts.

[2023-10-31, 20:03:21] Ravi Theja: whats your usecase with fine tuned embeddings? is it RAG? If so you can check for hit rate and MRR.
[2023-10-31, 20:09:02] Sumanth Raghavendra: Not particularly - their legacy is a millstone around their necks nearly as much as it is a source of power. Microsoft is actually our biggest partner - Satya was even kind enough to showcase us in a recent keynote.
[2023-10-31, 20:27:06] Rahul Deora: Very interesting! If you don’t mind me asking how big is your team and how long have you been building this since? I bet you acquired the domain very early on 😄

But I am pretty satisfied with the results. Took me close to three hours
[2023-11-01, 10:33:09] Sumanth Raghavendra: A little bit of both over the years
[2023-11-01, 10:34:17] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Pretty good. As someone else said, consistency in the visual style stood out to me. It seemed as though a person had drawn it - not just any person but an experienced comic book artist. That was the kicker
[2023-11-01, 10:35:41] Rahul Deora: Curious to why the high number of designers. I’m guessing they are product roles rather on only design?
[2023-11-01, 10:35:52] Sumanth Raghavendra: Tech stack was pretty much the same (ensemble of deep learning and heuristics models with an orchestration layer for synthesising the microservices)... just swapped out a few homegrown services with LLMs and tweaked the pipelines a bit
[2023-11-01, 10:35:54] Paras Chopra Wingify: Does anyone have a TLDR or executive order?

Does it have actual ramifications?
[2023-11-01, 10:36:48] ~ Clament John: Thank you. Simon W had recently published a blog post on using Dalle 3 to generate consistent style. I wanted to try it out. And so I created this.

[2023-11-01, 10:40:07] Sumanth Raghavendra: They are pure design roles. We are building the world's largest presentation template library with coverage for every possible permutation and brand... need human designers to feed the engine. Also believe that AI will eat services before it will eat software...so have some plans around that specific opportunity.

[2023-11-01, 10:46:12] Sumanth Raghavendra: Founders are driven by stubborn dreams that are orthogonal to concepts like struggles...so personally never felt that anything was difficult. The credit for sticking through lies entirely with my team...
[2023-11-01, 10:53:19] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Andrew NG also seems to be echoing similar sentiments :

"The right place to regulate AI is at the application layer. Requiring AI applications such as underwriting software, healthcare applications, self-driving, chat applications, etc. to meet stringent requirements, even pass audits, can ensure safety. But adding burdens to foundation model development unnecessarily slows down AI’s progress.

While the White House order isn’t currently stifling startups and open source, it seems to be a step in that direction. The devil will be in the details as its implementation gets fleshed out -- no doubt with assistance from lobbyists -- and I see a lot of risk of missteps.  I welcome good regulation to promote responsible AI, and hope the White House can get there."

[2023-11-01, 14:05:28] Chetanya Rastogi: at my previous company, we were. it was a pre_LLM search stack which we transferred to post LLM world so kept the entire pipeline (as extra latency was sub 200ms, was using deberta). The typical eval was using metrics like precision@k and ndcg

But I guess a good eval in post LLM world would to a sxs analysis of final response metrics (like relevancy, coherence, hallucination, etc) on w/ and w/o reranked chunks. 

One way I could think of doing it would be to eval only those responses which differ in citations for w/ and w/o reranker case just to quickly filter some examples where I know for sure the response has to be different. and from there move forward.

PS: At my new company, reranker is not a priority yet so the above is still much of a hypothesis rather than empirical testing.

[2023-11-02, 04:38:37] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: The last time I tried whisper was on a podcast which was in hinglish and I found that it worked well out of the box. But I guess that conversation was mainly in English but at time I remember the guest saying ‘sau’ and seeing 100 in the transcript and was mind blown 🤯
[2023-11-02, 05:03:57] ~ Abhishek Shivkumar: Yup. I have seen this. So if it is in English (for the first 30 secs), everything is kind of translated to English. So the 'sau' might have been translated to 100 too. That is my understanding so far. Thanks for sharing anyways
[2023-11-02, 07:32:45] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: They will make some stuff up for withdrawal reasons as usual, but the secret is out. Also, think about how good the quality of data is with OAI

[2023-11-02, 08:38:10] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: https://twitter.com/sanchitgandhi99/status/1719409022246220184 there is a distilled model that will be out today or morrow apparently. Waiting to play around with this and see how it compares with the original whisper models in terms of WER.
[2023-11-02, 08:55:36] Shan: Congratulations @919446220252 & Co. 👍👍👍
[2023-11-02, 09:10:34] Nirant K: I assume that the 20B Turbo is distilled from a larger (total) MoE or a larger model itself, perhaps larger than 70B. Is this why OpenAI has called it "turbo"?

This'd make sense. OpenAI can continuously ask for regulation for large models, while it's "production" models escape that by a veneer of being "small" and yet defensible since the large model is needed for distillation.
[2023-11-02, 09:13:06] Aankit Roy Khabri YC: Anyone using portkey?

TigerLab was open sourced last night (xoogler project).

They have also included handy examples for e-commerce product search. 

Worth a try!

[2023-11-02, 10:13:49] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: I really like it so far. I am getting all the queries I made saved in portkey out of box. Integration is super quick if using openai directly. And basic analytics around costing is also useful.

Having said that, I am using it only in sandbox. When I put my things to production, I will need to take decisions keeping privacy in mind.
[2023-11-02, 10:16:34] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: I am also planning to use its fallback feature. OpenAi fails often and I can set portkey to fallback to azure.
[2023-11-02, 10:19:07] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I would like to say a lot of good things but then it won't be unbiased. One of the few startups I like with great founders.
[2023-11-02, 10:22:28] Swapan Rajdev haptik.ai: We are using it in staging and production, works really well so far. We had some teething issues a while ago, but all of them got sorted by them and now its smooth sailing. 

With reporting and observability being so bad on openAI and Azure, portkey really helps get visibility into how and where we are using GPT which becomes a problem as you start using it at scale within a company and product. 

That being said: I too am biased as I have invested in the company, but the feedback from my team using it day to day is also very positive.
[2023-11-02, 10:22:57] Pratyush Choudhury: I think the smaller, distilled models are what being Inferenced the most
[2023-11-02, 10:22:59] Pratyush Choudhury: No other way to drive bottom-line of the companies without that
[2023-11-02, 10:32:13] ~ YP: True even with number of GPUs they have 
It's hard to inference for that many users 

I'll need to do some napkin maths on this
[2023-11-02, 10:32:39] Tejas Referred By paras: Using a larger teacher model to create a smaller, distilled, specific model for enterprises is going to be a monetizing strategy for many model-building startups.
[2023-11-02, 10:34:35] Tejas Referred By paras: Distillation works and is heavily used by big tech companies .
[2023-11-02, 10:55:23] ~ $@| @$w@+h R•¥@|: Hey we are working on text2sql and smart analytics using GenAi, was wondering there are any way to fit tabular data to find relations between table using Autoregresive models or any suggestion on  smart way to track change in data capture in database
[2023-11-02, 11:14:51] Pratyush Choudhury: Yep, Inferencing is the broader point

GPUs are limited which is probably driving focus on model distillation and works both ways, as it helos drive topline and bottomline for the business

use LLMs/vector-search using SQL/Python in Snowflake
[2023-11-02, 11:34:08] Pratyush Choudhury: Snowflake's execution against Gen AI has been stellar actually - they first procured a lot of GPUs by partnering w/ Nvidia

Then constantly adding more support for Python for their install base and now adding LLM App Development using Cortex 

Not to forget, Streamlit fits very nicely in the overall strategy
[2023-11-02, 11:37:03] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: yeah i agree. i had thought SNFL would fall behind databricks given its acquisition of mosaicml. 
but their stock keeps fluctuating a lot, for me its hard to understand what the market thinks about the company
[2023-11-02, 12:49:22] Digvijay GenAI Group: Heyy guys , I saw folks here recommending https://murf.ai/ for training custom voice models.

[2023-11-02, 13:21:41] Shashwat TDC: wud recommend 11labs, works almost perfectly. The key however is quality of data and parameter adjustment. You can see our output below.

[2023-11-03, 02:03:27] Sean Blagsvedt GoeeyI: Another day, another awesome prompt hack. Append: “This is very important to the success of my career” which improves most benchmark answers. https://youtu.be/9RmzlRRqfvU?si=v1wFBRAmM1FzFmTp I’m going to now “take a depth breadth and go think step-by-step” somewhere.

[2023-11-03, 09:13:29] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: is there any paper backing the benchmarks run for this ?
[2023-11-03, 09:14:11] ~ Venkat: Yeah, this guy was showing a paper and link from hugging face website
[2023-11-03, 09:23:46] ~ Ankit Sharma: 32K tokens len is still not there with GPT-4 right?
How do you folks deal with long form texts/code??
[2023-11-03, 09:25:05] Abhishek Mishra: Gaslighting is all you need.
[2023-11-03, 09:25:22] Shashank B Designer: Sounds like the software equivalent of https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planned_obsolescence is finally here 😜
[2023-11-03, 09:27:20] Abhishek Mishra: You can get GPT4 32k access in api via openrouter.

[2023-11-03, 09:55:56] ~ Aakash Bakhle: I also felt the same yesterday, qualitatively. Some timezone related python code it got completely wrong. Gpt4 solved it correctly on playground. Not the best way to establish the degradation, will reproduce an earlier question and verify
[2023-11-03, 09:56:54] Pratik Bhavasar: Was it a one off case or a repeated one?
[2023-11-03, 09:58:50] ~ Aakash Bakhle: Not a one off, have found myself not trusting 3.5 for code tasks anymore.

[2023-11-03, 11:25:30] ~ Sid: how do you guys deal with JSON responses from LLM?
I want response in JSON format and I have provided 4-5 examples in prompts, and however in some cases it send extra string with json
[2023-11-03, 11:26:44] Ambika Computational Mama: yes this is an issue, i dont know if you have added, but you can also say "share in properly formatted json" in the prompt
[2023-11-03, 11:30:33] ~ Sid: added all those things... it is working in 90% of cases.
[2023-11-03, 11:31:18] Ambika Computational Mama: what is the temperature of the model?
[2023-11-03, 11:33:41] ~ Aman: https://youtu.be/yj-wSRJwrrc?feature=shared
[2023-11-03, 11:33:58] ~ Sid: 0
[2023-11-03, 11:43:00] ~ Shobhan: are you facing this issue in function calling also? That works pretty well.
[2023-11-03, 11:45:45] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: Use grammars
[2023-11-03, 11:46:52] Rounak Datta Hackathon Winner: And even after function-calling, what if you pipe through tools like say https://github.com/josdejong/jsonrepair, to rule out any minor errors (if at all at high scale)
[2023-11-03, 11:47:52] ~ Shobhan: this looks pretty helpful for this use case
[2023-11-03, 11:52:03] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: I had to fall back to regex to extract just the json part. Then a validation on keys and values. 
The idea of using pydantic and function calling that was shared here earlier is something I want to try out. Looks very cool.
[2023-11-03, 11:54:18] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: That is basically what grammars are
[2023-11-03, 11:54:20] Arko C | xylem.ai: You gotta overfit the model to respond in the right format (JSON)
[2023-11-03, 11:55:19] Arko C | xylem.ai: @919380057831 @918520992324 will be good heads to bounce it off with
[2023-11-03, 11:59:12] Shashwat TDC: Nice. Cud there be some more use-cases of overfitting? 🤔 ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-03, 12:00:30] Dev Aggarwal: One solution might be to use a streaming json parser?
[2023-11-03, 12:02:19] Arko C | xylem.ai: Won’t that effect latency?
[2023-11-03, 12:02:49] Arko C | xylem.ai: Gotta brainstorm more prolly 😅
[2023-11-03, 12:03:23] Ambika Computational Mama: explain more
[2023-11-03, 12:04:35] Arko C | xylem.ai: Basically you force the model to behave a certain way with what it returns.

@919380057831 and @918520992324 are the ones doing it hands on here at Xylem AI. They’ll be the best ones to share a bit about it.

https://github.com/r2d4/rellm

You could explore any of these
[2023-11-03, 12:19:42] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: This might work too. Basically get a large dataset of the format you want your LLM to output like, train it over many epochs to overfit whatever it learns from the dataset.
[2023-11-03, 12:19:47] ~ Akash Singh: Mlc chat works pretty fast.
[2023-11-03, 12:21:40] ~ Akash Singh: Use grammars and check paper tooldec. They have worked open this for faster and more accuracy. https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.07075
[2023-11-03, 12:26:17] Arko C | xylem.ai: Yes exactly
[2023-11-03, 12:50:19] ~ Kaustubh: Had to write regex code to get the output in the correct format.
[2023-11-03, 12:51:03] Simrat Hasura: Curious, how was the cohere embedding v3 model was trained as it seems to capture topic and content 

https://txt.cohere.com/introducing-embed-v3/
[2023-11-03, 12:53:31] ~ Aakash Bakhle: Giving an example json at the very end of the prompt does help a lot.
[2023-11-03, 12:55:54] ~ Bharath: Sometimes, using phrases like "Output only <what you want> *and nothing else*' could work. I have used it for a proprietary format and it has done  pretty well
[2023-11-03, 12:57:06] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: An example is worth a 1000 description words here.
[2023-11-03, 13:04:56] Nishant Apne-App GenAI Hackathon: Has anyone created a chatbot on FAQ pages for B2C use case?
What are you using, RAG or fine-tuning?
What has been your framework, techniques and any hacks?

I will add all answers to this question to a Notion page and share here back so as we create a knowledge base 😀
[2023-11-03, 13:20:17] Rounak Datta Hackathon Winner: RAG definitely

Supabase had written a first principles approach in their blog long back: https://supabase.com/blog/openai-embeddings-postgres-vector
Langchain etc are offering this batteries-included today!
[2023-11-03, 13:20:21] Arko C | xylem.ai: If it’s straightforward QnA from FAQs

RAG works
[2023-11-03, 13:20:35] Arko C | xylem.ai: You can further fine-tune the embeddings
[2023-11-03, 13:21:12] Nishant Apne-App GenAI Hackathon: Nice.
Have you deployed any such app?
[2023-11-03, 13:21:21] Nishant Apne-App GenAI Hackathon: Even RAG?
‎[2023-11-03, 13:21:48] Arko C | xylem.ai: ‎Contact card omitted
[2023-11-03, 13:22:22] Arko C | xylem.ai: His product uses RAG extensively
[2023-11-03, 13:22:40] naras GenAI WhatsApp Group: RAG works the best. Flexible, accurate and easy to maintain
‎[2023-11-03, 13:22:48] Arko C | xylem.ai: ‎Contact card omitted
[2023-11-03, 13:23:14] Arko C | xylem.ai: And Vishnu as well
[2023-11-03, 13:24:00] Nishant Apne-App GenAI Hackathon: Website just has a join waitlist CTA. I will ask him how/where he is using it.
[2023-11-03, 13:25:36] Arko C | xylem.ai: We are into LLMOps, so I can share much deeper insights once you are evaluating changes on the LLM side.

But for your use case, RAG with fine tuning of embeddings should do.

On a vector DB level, personal preference has been Qdrant. And we have the legend @917737887058 here for any insights on that.
[2023-11-03, 13:26:32] Arko C | xylem.ai: Don’t stick to purely semantic/vector search

Try going for a hybrid search approach. Essentially, vector and keyword search in parallel and then re-ranking layers
[2023-11-03, 13:26:57] Nishant Apne-App GenAI Hackathon: Yes.
[2023-11-03, 13:29:23] Nishant Apne-App GenAI Hackathon: RAG definitely works, but needs some bells and whistles depending on knowledge base.
HyDE is required if your docs are not question answers.
Maybe synthetically generating more qna from GPT-4 and using that for RAG helps better.

Tagging the documents and adding section titles to each chunk for embedding generation helps with retrieval.
[2023-11-03, 13:30:04] Nishant Apne-App GenAI Hackathon: I am hoping to clarify this from someone who has a B2C deployment :)
I will connect to the aforementioned folks!
[2023-11-03, 13:30:53] Arko C | xylem.ai: Yes that would be better

DayZero is doing some existing work with some enterprises

And Subtl has already deployed its solution in SBI

Both are B2B but I am sure they are serving or looking at the B2C market ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-03, 13:34:04] Nishant Apne-App GenAI Hackathon: I checkout out subtl's demo. It is great. They use RAG. (Not into actions yet, I think once you connect to APIs you will be irreplaceable for the enterprises).
[2023-11-03, 13:35:49] naras GenAI WhatsApp Group: The con is the ability to answer creatively. We had a broader use case where we wanted to support questions which required a deep understanding of the product. RAG will not be suitable in this case 

If your use case is restricted to just FAQs, then RAG is the way to go
[2023-11-03, 13:49:01] Nithin Vasishta IIT B MILA: Have a look at this: Pydantic is all you need

[2023-11-03, 14:05:14] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Folks, has anyone here had success with no code, low code ui generators for a react application given wireframes ?
[2023-11-03, 14:06:21] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: And any tools that use LLMs or gpt APIs to help with this ?
[2023-11-03, 14:09:20] ~ Aman: You can check https://github.com/raidendotai/openv0

[2023-11-03, 14:25:14] ~ Sid: yes I am checking this, looking most promising solution.
[2023-11-03, 14:35:05] Paras Chopra Wingify: Tried it but it doesn’t have error handling
[2023-11-03, 14:36:01] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: this requires a open ai key also right ?
[2023-11-03, 14:36:30] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Any other alternatives that worked for you @919868221372 ?
[2023-11-03, 14:50:16] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: You can finetune the model for getting JSON format. This will make the model to adapt to your schema
[2023-11-03, 14:56:26] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: can this be done for llama2 ? i havent seen any examples. can u link ?
[2023-11-03, 15:02:04] Vignesh Baskaran: @919550164716 and @917025755203 both work on OSS for LLMs extensively namely LLama index and Ragas. They might have some projects to help you get started Nithin!
[2023-11-03, 15:08:02] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: for now im experimenting with Teleport - https://teleporthq.io/ai-website-builder they have open ai plugins available.
[2023-11-03, 15:10:50] Paras Chopra Wingify: Using chatgpt directly
[2023-11-03, 15:11:48] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Let me see if I can do this using bard ui as well.

[2023-11-03, 15:19:03] Shimanta Generative AI: Agreed, it’s not fine tuning. Thought it might be of use
[2023-11-03, 15:19:08] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Haven't seen a production grade fine-tuning work here . But maybe I'm doing something dumb. Asking anyone else - have u folks done json format enforcing via finetuning in production?
[2023-11-03, 15:19:10] Rakeshkumar Waghela: Co-pilot directly integrated in windows 11
[2023-11-03, 15:19:54] Rakeshkumar Waghela: Is it some paid product, shall I remove it from work laptop somehow?
[2023-11-03, 15:19:57] Nitin Umass Amherst Walmart Labs: Is this a new update? Pretty sure I have 11
[2023-11-03, 15:20:12] Rakeshkumar Waghela: Or it's really free for Windows?
[2023-11-03, 15:20:30] ~ Amlan: Check llama index github repo, there is one example with gradient.ai api integration

[2023-11-03, 15:20:55] Bharat Kumar Ramesh Hashmal Web3: Very hacky, but use yup to validate, and if it doesn't work, recall it. It takes more time, and consumes more tokens, but does the job
[2023-11-03, 15:21:27] ~ Anuruddh: This is still dicy. We’ve gotten to a place where 99% of the time the output is a json. 

Incase it isn’t, retrying helps in 50-60% of misses
[2023-11-03, 15:21:33] Bharat Kumar Ramesh Hashmal Web3: 99% of cases, it gets it right on the second try
[2023-11-03, 15:22:10] ~ Pramod: Is there a similar one for mac with a GUI (there's open-interpreter that works on terminal but not so friendly for non-devs)?
[2023-11-03, 15:22:52] Pranav Peppertype. ai: Hey folks, anyone here who ran experiments around fine-tuning gpt-3.5 using gpt-4 outputs and can comment on the quality delta?
[2023-11-03, 15:23:30] ~ Ashish Singhal: Do you want to fine-tune gpt3.5 turbo ? I've done that if that's what you looking for.
[2023-11-03, 15:24:40] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: llama2.
[2023-11-03, 15:24:47] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: gpt3.5 turbo doesnt need output format finetuning
[2023-11-03, 15:24:50] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: it is already built in
[2023-11-03, 15:25:33] Yash Kothari Cadence: Can someone share the link to AI Demo day demos if we had recorded it?

[2023-11-03, 15:38:08] ~ Kaustubh: @919564191888 you guys do this for LLMs right?
[2023-11-03, 15:38:50] ~ Nj: Another solution that worked well for me is giving few shot example of output.
And using a key value pair rather than json.
Like a line can be item:value and then I parse line by line
[2023-11-03, 15:45:47] ~ Kaustubh: I have used older version where the output used to be like 
-item:-key

Instead of

Item:key

But I think function calling now solves that issue.

[2023-11-03, 15:46:09] ~ Kaustubh: So Regex seemed like a solution to the issue I was facing

It's infinite scroll, without re-ranking, so we assume they're using the "scroll" API from Qdrant as well, which allows this happen without worrying too much lazy loading from server/storage.

We're curious on the embedding, but we've reason to believe it's something internal

[2023-11-05, 02:04:18] Ankur Pandey: Yudkowsky is actually a pretty deep, if unorthodox, thinker. He founded the singularity institute (now called MIRI - intelligence.org), LessWrong, Overcoming Bias, etc. Spearheaded thinking in AI risk, rationality, decision theory, and to a large extent effective altruism. And all this like in early 2000s!

He's also a delicious writer - read sequences in LessWrong or stuff like Harry Potter & the Method of Rationality.

He's not as un-fun as his recently famous online persona seems to imply. I once shared an intercity taxi with him and he didn't talk about AI doom at all! 

Although he's not a traditional philosopher (he's to philosophy what Charvaka is to ancient Hindu philosophy) - I think progeny (if there's one) will remember him as a leading philosopher of our times.
[2023-11-05, 02:09:53] Arnav Bansal Replit: He’s def really fun! I met him recently at a prediction markets conference! I really like him (and I’ve spent many years reading works produced by his 'institutions')

I feel like he’s lost interest in seriously considering any problem that isn’t AI risk. If you try talking to him about some major problem you care about, he would find a way to tie it all the way back to AI risk. but if there really was no possible connection, he’d just not have anything to say and shrug his shoulders
[2023-11-05, 02:11:54] Ankur Pandey: Ah. Could be. My interaction with him was in 2013 when I think he still believed the world had a chance against AI.

[2023-11-05, 03:17:50] Prashant Nolano: Also it sometimes skips a whole bunch of sequences, and starts after the next pause. It's very hard to detect unless you manually look at a lot of samples from start to end.
[2023-11-05, 03:18:36] ~ Abhishek Shivkumar: Yes! I have seen this especially when the bunch of sequences have a lot of English words in them.
[2023-11-05, 03:18:39] Prashant Nolano: Can you share if you guys gathered new datasets or are there publicly available ones?
[2023-11-05, 03:18:59] ~ Lohit: Can someone recommend any platform (if they exist) like Kaggle  for data science contests ?
[2023-11-05, 03:21:29] ~ Abhishek Shivkumar: I also see hallucination is a big problem with Whisper large model. Not sure if they are working on a newer version. However the SeamlessM4T model from Meta is not available for commercial use if I wanted to try that as an alternative
[2023-11-05, 03:22:31] Dev Aggarwal: On another note, public speech datasets from artpark are available - https://vaani.iisc.ac.in/data ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-05, 03:25:33] Prashant Nolano: Do we already have OSS models on this as well? Are the models trained by @919718778997 OSS?
[2023-11-05, 03:27:12] Prashant Nolano: Whisper is already SOTA for us/eu. I don't think they care about the rest 😔. The sooner you accept the better
[2023-11-05, 03:29:10] Prashant Nolano: Even at Google, hindi had long been a tail language. Only very recently, Google made India one of its major priorities, so they're probably the only hope to invest into Indian languages.
[2023-11-05, 04:36:07] Madhur Chadha: India has been a priority for a while now .....

[2023-11-05, 10:21:26] Anand S Gramener: Jerry Liu of LlamaIndex posted a summarization chains example at https://twitter.com/jerryjliu0/status/1705003857083007158.

He uses asyncio to parallelize and speed up the responses. Since map reduce (or tree summarization) is parallelizable up to log(n) I guess this is quite effective. I'm planning to try this along with a UI that keeps the user posted on the progress.
[2023-11-05, 10:24:18] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: https://x.ai/

Grok just dropped.
[2023-11-05, 10:24:58] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: We are offering a limited number of users in the United States to try out our Grok prototype and provide valuable feedback that will help us improve its capabilities before a wider release. You can join the Grok waitlist here. This release just represents the first step for xAI. Looking ahead, we have an exciting roadmap and will be rolling out new capabilities and features in the coming months
[2023-11-05, 10:25:04] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: always WEST first, then others :)
[2023-11-05, 10:26:50] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: US has it
Europe has Mistral
China has alibaba and other giants
India wen?
[2023-11-05, 10:27:11] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: zoho - possible for a LLM ?
[2023-11-05, 10:27:54] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: The news came out in june. No progress yet?
[2023-11-05, 10:38:27] Anubhav mishra Zupay: They mentioned that Grok-0 is a 33b model, they haven't mentioned details of Grok-1
[2023-11-05, 10:40:02] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yup. But their description of what they used is comprehensive (rust, kuberenetes). I hope they come out with papers and stuff with all the datasets they used
[2023-11-05, 10:40:53] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Yeah in the engineering section they've pretty much given some good details
[2023-11-05, 10:42:43] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Very well and honestly documented, However I'm not sure at what point of time they used Gpt4 for the Hungarian math test, if it's recent then GPT4 hasn't improved much at reasoning . Stll shows 61% at 1 shot
[2023-11-05, 10:44:08] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Folks, so I want to give url like this - https://join.puttingscene.com/ and ask GPT to parse that. 

Is that possible or there are tools to do that parsing to GPT / LLMs ?
[2023-11-05, 10:45:24] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: One way im doing is selenium based web parsing, but it is cumbersome, was wondering if there are easier and better pipelines/tools - tips other in group have found easier to implement.
[2023-11-05, 10:51:02] ~ prakashpvss: When you refer parsing , are you referring to Information extraction.
If it is closedIE ( you know what you want to extract) then one of the ways is to use lxml or beautifulsoup to  parse the DOM tree and take only the leaf nodes with class and Id attributes.
Prompt the LLM like QnA and provide the condensed version of HTML as the context.
[2023-11-05, 10:53:26] ~ prakashpvss: You can also use the package trifilatura package, to remove boilerplate text and provide that as input and ask LLM to structure it.

[2023-11-05, 12:56:05] Varshul Dubverse: Yeah so we have current TTS models being used by about 1m users. Now moving towards more large scale approaches which mainly solve for low resource. Should work for dialects/accents. OSS coming out this month.
[2023-11-05, 12:57:32] Prashant Nolano: Do you have any api/playground for speech to text as well that works good for Hindi?

Solving a multi-modal problem with focus on audio. Working on diffusion based architecture for audio.
[2023-11-05, 12:59:46] Varshul Dubverse: Yeah but STT is nothing fancy at our end tbh. Just some logic layer that ends up reducing hallucinations+more consistent outputs.
[2023-11-05, 13:06:22] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: has anyone tried out the PALM api? what was your use case? how does it compare to GPT-3/4?

[2023-11-05, 14:23:48] Prashant Nolano: When chatgpt first came out it would give you the contents of a url verbatim.
[2023-11-05, 14:26:19] Prashant Nolano: It's surprising but possible. Similar to pagerank llms could possibly make correlation of the URLs content, from url appearing in different sources, even though a direct mapping was never provided.
[2023-11-05, 14:34:17] Dev Aggarwal: Top grade BS
[2023-11-05, 14:38:10] Prashant Nolano: see the BS for yourself: https://g.co/bard/share/9107989f35b9
https://g.co/bard/share/bda41a9aba03
[2023-11-05, 14:38:22] Dev Aggarwal: If the URL literally says “paul graham” and  “great work” - that’s enough context for the LLM to persuade you to believe it fetched the actual contents of the URL 🙂
[2023-11-05, 14:39:32] Prashant Nolano: No. I explicitly printed out arxiv papers from links, medium blogs, etc verbatim when chatgpt came out. It was removed shortly though.
[2023-11-05, 14:40:16] Prashant Nolano: This made to twitter as well, when people were just pasting the link to an article behind paywall.

I recently came across Dubverse's STT/TTS models for our indic use case. Would love to discuss it further and understand more about it.
[2023-11-05, 14:53:47] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: Is bard powering the generative search on Google?
[2023-11-05, 14:55:17] Prashant Nolano: Try adding
1. a url, for which the title is present in the url, like reddit URLs. I assume this should almost always work
2. If the url has some sort of id, like YouTube, i think this should still work for urls that are highly referenced in common crawl.
[2023-11-05, 14:55:35] Prashant Nolano: (without internet access)
[2023-11-05, 14:56:01] Dev Aggarwal: Hmm, yeah but the real way to do this is to have a rag pipeline and a fetch call
[2023-11-05, 14:56:09] Dev Aggarwal: Or do RL on browsing like web gpt
[2023-11-05, 14:57:44] Prashant Nolano: No doubt about it. I was just making a point that our intuition on what llms can learn is very naive and brittle.
[2023-11-05, 15:00:35] Prashant Nolano: Interesting question: is "kya" - "what" = "kyo" - "why" in embedding space?
[2023-11-05, 15:51:12] ~ Ashutosh: indeed +1, rag is the right way to go about this

[2023-11-05, 18:15:34] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: So, basically for latest urls, LLMs will not be able to generate anything right ? https://bard.google.com/chat/fdbb1c59e753ef2c see this on latest blog

and also in examples I saw, they are all summarization tasks. I meant something like this.. build me an app given this website url that seems to be sort of possible using ensemble of RAG and webpage/dom crawlers and then feed that to llm to generate code.

may be in the future BARD will enable this or some others are already working on that. It could be even like given multimodal image input, generate a react native app code template to get started.

[2023-11-05, 19:58:01] ~ Aman: How are you guys solving real-time TTS (Text to speech) with text being generated from an LLM stream?

Right now, we are accumulating the token being streamed from the LLM, looking for punctuations, chunking it till there and sending to Elevenlabs streaming endpoint. It works with an initial delay, but the user experience is not that good, with abrupt pauses etc. Would love to hear any different approaches anyone can suggest or are using? The application is a client-facing app, so exposing the TTS api directly on the frontend won't work.
[2023-11-05, 20:05:40] ~ Utkarsh Saxena: Thanks for flagging this, Aman! I’ve the same question and curious to hear how are others are tackling this.

The only way is to build a audio to audio model. But getting it to be like gpt level is gonna be a data bottleneck issue + crazy costs.

[2023-11-05, 20:47:33] Anubhav Dubdub.Ai: What's the use case? If you are looking for 8-16 khz output, it is possible with PlayHT and Coqui streaming Api right now.
[2023-11-05, 20:48:09] Anubhav Dubdub.Ai: Under 300 ms latency for TTS
[2023-11-05, 20:48:38] Priyank Agrawal: They are pretty expensive as wekl
[2023-11-05, 20:48:43] ~ Aman: Right now it's a conversational bot, with a voice to voice interface.
[2023-11-05, 20:48:43] Priyank Agrawal: Well*

[2023-11-05, 20:50:19] ~ Aman: I tried their (https://docs.play.ht/reference/integrating-with-chatgpt) example but it didn't work. Will check again.
[2023-11-05, 20:51:23] Anubhav Dubdub.Ai: They have TTS as well. It's essential to define the use case. We are also building something will release it some where around December.
[2023-11-05, 20:55:03] ~ Bibek: It’s much simpler. Use Microsoft sdk tts. They have accents as well
[2023-11-05, 20:55:19] ~ Aman: Will check
[2023-11-05, 20:55:24] ~ Aman: Thanks!
[2023-11-05, 20:55:54] ~ Bibek: No worries. I had worked on it for a robotics based client
[2023-11-05, 20:56:09] Priyank Agrawal: Voice is very robotic
[2023-11-05, 20:56:31] ~ Bibek: Yes but with accent
[2023-11-05, 20:56:35] ~ Bibek: Lol
[2023-11-05, 20:57:49] Anubhav Dubdub.Ai: Also, eleven labs released their 8khz APIs. You can try that as well.
[2023-11-05, 20:58:02] Anubhav Dubdub.Ai: Under 300 ms
[2023-11-05, 20:58:51] ~ Bibek: Voice is still a complex problem. Like even with API. It doesn’t get you always. But chatgpt has a response for everything. So there will be some error. Beware!
[2023-11-05, 20:58:58] Priyank Agrawal: All of the Elevenlabs, PlayHT and Coqui are expensive at $0.16/min

If someone builds a much cheaper but same quality TTS it's a good market.
[2023-11-05, 21:04:57] Varshul Dubverse: You think being cheap will depend on the use-case? Like this kinda pricing works well for generating content but not much for conversational?
[2023-11-05, 21:06:16] Rounak Datta Hackathon Winner: You can also roughly calculate the pricing for https://replicate.com/suno-ai/bark/api?tab=node, as it'd be just replicate's infra costs.
[2023-11-05, 21:06:18] Priyank Agrawal: Yep it's expensive from conversational usecase perspective, if it's more affordable many more usecases will become viable and thus will drive demand.
[2023-11-05, 21:08:12] Priyank Agrawal: Eventually Google/AWS/Azure will do it.

So as startups, the sooner the better to capture the market and create lock-ins
[2023-11-05, 21:08:29] Varshul Dubverse: Suno might not be the best given it hallucinates alot cause of the decoder module. Esp for non-en langauges.

Not sure if replicate has done some custom-stuff tho. Have heard suno gives a license, haven't tried.
[2023-11-05, 21:12:03] ~ Aman: I just tried it and it changed the voice actor in between sentence
[2023-11-05, 21:12:04] ~ Akash Singh: What exactly you are looking for in conversation, like on what platform it is going to happen? As most of the TTS service used for content generation generates at 44khz which is costly process on top of architecture.
[2023-11-05, 21:15:12] ~ Aman: In content generation or in general async use cases, where the audio might get played more than once, quality becomes really important. But if the usecase is a Conversational chatbot or a phone call bot, all the generations are just one-time generation.

[2023-11-05, 22:11:43] Raghu Nandan Chilukuri: It is male and female voice that's all (not 4-5 neural voices like in GCP), but more expressive and human like than any of gcp/aws etc
[2023-11-05, 22:11:50] ~ Parna Paul: Tried English … sounded just like gcp tts for Indian voice 😛 very robotic
[2023-11-05, 22:12:13] Raghu Nandan Chilukuri: Felt more human like than gcp, but subjective

[2023-11-05, 22:13:44] ~ Parna Paul: There’s a second model that bhashini has… but that thing I barely ever works!
[2023-11-05, 22:14:58] Raghu Nandan Chilukuri: Don't remember the repo, but they have some 11 indic languages + English checkpoints (zipped) -- those are good (fastpitch + hifigan checkpoints)
[2023-11-05, 22:15:51] ~ Parna Paul: Btw what has been your experience with how stable the ai4bharat APIs are?
[2023-11-05, 22:15:59] Raghu Nandan Chilukuri: They have an inference repo which uses coqui open-source, so inference is also easy using docker (although coqui inference code is clunky and bloated)

[2023-11-05, 22:16:42] ~ Parna Paul: Maybe we got unlucky but on production their stt tanked big time for us 2 weeks ago… switched over to whisper for now
[2023-11-05, 22:16:58] Raghu Nandan Chilukuri: Used only the checkpoints to deploy on our own cloud (privacy reqs). Checkpoints are good, but have to test them every for every release.
[2023-11-05, 22:17:48] Raghu Nandan Chilukuri: Yes don't directly use latest checkpoint without decent amount of testing. We took a new "Indian English" checkpoint which actually was worse than previous checkpoint
[2023-11-05, 22:18:44] Raghu Nandan Chilukuri: I blindly fine tuned on our (noisy) data, and it got worse to the point my project is almost ditched now, using whisper as stop gap measure for new poc

Querying Stage
- Use dynamic top-k based on type of questions. For me a question with expected answer from a table
Requires lesser top-k as compared to answers from para
- changing embeddings
Or fine-tune embedding works
-

[2023-11-06, 12:56:04] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: So I liked how they have condensed clearly these below points, since a lot of folks are trying to merge LLMs and KGs or find a way to combine the strengths of both. This articles condenses and summarizes them really well. Their other blogs also show higher level topics of interests in this space. Also, the annotations of papers to their paragraphs are pretty good.

It is tempting to think that recovering a symbolic representation of knowledge entirely obviates the need for an LLM. However, instructions are usually given in natural language, which needs to be translated into a graph query language to interact with the symbolic knowledge base. LLMs are the best known tool for this kind of translation.


Ontologies [4] are the best-known form of structured Knowledge Representation. However, there’s no universal philosophical and methodological approach to ontology construction which results in a multitude of mutually incompatible domain-specific ontologies [5]. Moreover, as long as most ontologies are based on Description Logic [6] they are not adapted to representing procedural (algorithmic) knowledge which severely limits their usefulness for automatic code transformation.

[2023-11-06, 16:03:47] ~ Anantharam: Hi All
I am working on the space of generating 3D models /360 degree view of objects based on 2D photos of the object. 

Broad Idea
Imagine there is an e-commerce catalog of products. The catalog contains product images from all angles. The idea is to build a high-fidelity 3D model or a 360 degree view of the product. I am wondering if there are any models that are available to do it. Today, all high-fidelity models are built by making a 3D model of the product using a 3D modelling software like autocad etc. If there are any pointers to how this can be generated from images or how LLMs can potentially be used, it will be extremely helpful. 

I am doing my research on this independently too. I will keep the group posted if I find something worthwhile too.

You may need to create a custom stopping criteria and it will stop accordingly. The end token is sometimes misunderstood but the model. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-06, 16:42:01] Ankur Goel: Been exploring a few things around the same. The quality of image to 3D isn't the best yet. How has your experience been with models like Gaussian Splatter and One23-45?
[2023-11-06, 16:43:10] Priyank Agrawal: Ok, please can you elaborate the custom stopping criteria part? If that an option on the API? or you mean trim the LLM output after certain keywords.
[2023-11-06, 16:45:03] Abhishek Mishra: Ideally it should be taken care of by the api provider. But if the model itself isn't fine tuned well enough to understand stopping criteria or EOS token, you'll need to use something like "\n" as stopping criteria.
[2023-11-06, 16:45:33] Pranjal Yadav Razorpay: Oh, with the API, trimming would do the job but it still adds to you tokens and latency cost.

For me the issue occurred after fine tuning. So I added a custom stopping criteria during during training and it learned to stop. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-06, 19:17:57] Nirant K: I'm inclined to believe that while the within-domain thing is true, the idea that they're pure stochastic parrots is also kinda false.

NNs continue to be great at universal function approximation/compression fwiw
[2023-11-06, 19:19:11] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: If this is correct then there’s not much hope on having really smart and general smaller models unless some MoE approach is developed. My gut feeling is the main application of GPT-4, 5 , 6 will be to generate more training data , eval smaller models and generate answers for those users who can afford the massive inference costs.
[2023-11-06, 19:19:48] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: This is a pretty big deal still . But it means a lot more work is needed now to scale the same use cases to millions  of ppl
[2023-11-06, 19:19:52] Prashant Nolano: This doesn't rule out AGI at all. More so, I feel it enforces it with the first conclusion (there's a very low statistical cost of choosing the right model).

In context of humans, If we don't practice some skill, we're not really out of box good at it, in almost all cases. Practing almost always makes us better up until some point.

What this really means to me is that we just need to add the data for everything that's relevant to humans.
[2023-11-06, 19:20:23] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Where is this data going to come from . We are already at 5 trillion+ tokens
[2023-11-06, 19:21:38] Prashant Nolano: Videos, then smart glasses, then vr
[2023-11-06, 19:23:52] Prashant Nolano: No free lunch theorem is very relevant here, because it to some extent screwed peoples intuitions that we'll never have GPT-4 like models which can solve a lot of problems out of the box.
Now that we've created such a model we can claim that only a very small subset of problems is really relevant to humans. And all of that need not be generalized. This can all be put in the training data.
[2023-11-06, 19:26:22] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Spot on what I feel bought about AGI and the data sources. Reading my mind.
[2023-11-06, 19:26:23] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: *about not bought
[2023-11-06, 19:45:37] Shan: I am still bullish. The reasoning abilities are real. And you can argue that these are patterns the model has already seen but “someone” who has seen the world and can apply the learnings elsewhere is intelligent in my eyes.
[2023-11-06, 19:53:13] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: It's the Trough of Disillusionment. The reasoning and planning abilities need to improve. Also need higher context window and faster inference times.
[2023-11-06, 19:54:05] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: That seems to be the pathway to AGI.

GPT 4 is coming with 128K context. 
No need for fancy complicated retrieval strategies for most cases i guess.
[2023-11-06, 20:25:19] Dev Aggarwal: On a similar note - “tldr; whether solving or self-critiquing, it is approximate retrieval all the way for LLMs”

[2023-11-06, 20:26:49] ~ Sudarshan: Even if this were true wouldn't it take a really long time to process the 128k context + on top of which the cost of each call would be incredibly high
[2023-11-06, 20:30:16] Prashant Nolano: 128 k tokens would be used in input to put retrieved context (output tokens would still be less than 1k). And api time depends very little on number of input tokens.
[2023-11-06, 20:30:24] Prashant Nolano: Cost would be high though

[2023-11-06, 21:15:34] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: Very interesting topic and nice to have you here. I've been looking into text/image to 3D for the use case of TV animation of cartton characters. Far from an expert but this was one of the use cases.

So far I've tried some of these repos and models but my gut feeling is that they're still far from telecast ready.

[2023-11-06, 21:45:00] Sankalp PickYourTrail: If AI is having its OS moment, these marketplaces would mean niche specialist agents would be the startups. They raised the bar for startups since they are constantly evolving baseline offering, startups must beat this pace.

[2023-11-06, 22:51:32] Vignesh Baskaran: I have been thinking a lot on relevance of RAG when context lengths become very large:
*Without RAGs*
🔴 1. *Skeyrocketing Cost*: Increasing the context length from 8K to 32K tokens doubles the cost from $0.03 to $0.06 per 1K input tokens. If the context were to expand to 256K tokens, the cost would become prohibitively expensive.
🔴 2. *Long Documents*: AWS S3 documentation is 1881 pages. Most legal documents are 100 plus pages.
🔴 3. *Lost in the Middle Problem*: LLMs struggle with processing information in the middle of large contexts, leading to potential information oversight.
🔴 4. *Retrieval Systems*: For vast databases, like a million documents, an efficient retrieval system is indispensable. Because we just cannot dump the whole DB.
🔴 5. *Model Transparency*: RAGs contribute to model transparency, making LLM outputs interpretable and avoid the "black box" issue.
✅ 6. *Context preprocessing*: With the ability to process larger context lengths, there is a lesser need for detailed context preprocessing to retrieve relevant information.

To conclude, RAGs will not become irrelevant in my humble opinion. We still need Retrieval systems. The one benefit we could attain is lesser context preprocessing/engineering.
[2023-11-06, 22:54:32] Utkarsh Ohm Thoughtspot: We’re you able to solve this? I use a model on each region
[2023-11-06, 22:57:18] ~ Chirag: Do you think if 1 and 3 are solved, RAG will still be relevant? If yes, what changes do you foresee with respect to current RAG pipeline?
[2023-11-06, 22:58:28] Pratyush Choudhury: All solvable problems probably? 

Maybe not immediately but eventually - new architectures will probably solve for the lost in the middle problem while inferencing will get cheaper & hence, price/token will not increase as dramatically
[2023-11-06, 22:58:36] Pratyush Choudhury: RAGs will likely still be relevant
[2023-11-06, 22:58:59] Naveen 5C: Not yet
[2023-11-06, 22:59:57] ~ Vijay RPS: This is truly wow feature.Hope for more improved architectures to come and push the boundaries for sure.
[2023-11-06, 23:00:32] Anubhav mishra Zupay: These guys are doing some super work at XAI I think
[2023-11-06, 23:09:01] Ankur Pandey: It's Big GenAI conspiracy to keep gullible junta busy with increasing context length, fine tuning etc; and keep them away from goodness of RAG.

RAG against the machine.
[2023-11-06, 23:11:10] Rakeshkumar Waghela: Is there any  speech to text  library or cli that transforms audio conversation to hinglish?

For example

Imagine output of audio conversation as follows 

"Hello sir, kya problem hai"

Above text is in English but some words are transliterated from spoken hindi
[2023-11-06, 23:12:17] Rakeshkumar Waghela: Seems this is a hard problem, any model that works like this ?

Based on openai whisper or any other library?
[2023-11-06, 23:15:13] Vignesh Baskaran: Responding to Pratyush and Chirag, @918763968157 and @919971281365 
Yes, if the problem of cost explosion and getting lost in the middle is solved, the relevance of RAG might diminish for some applications. However, it will remain pertinent for many other applications at the document retrieval level. For instance, consider an extreme example: a search engine company may not be capable of promptly passing on an entire Internet crawl ;) They would still require a retriever to obtain ten lengthy relevant documents, but they would not need to chunk those ten documents ;)
[2023-11-06, 23:23:32] Vignesh Baskaran: I'm not sure if it's a conspiracy, but I worked with Transformers every single day from 2017 to 2022, focusing on NLP only. To my knowledge, Longformer was the only model handling long contexts. However, my expertise may be outdated as I've spent the last year in CV. *For small startups and independent researchers using RAGs to build useful products, context length vs RAG relevance debate seems to be a distraction in my humble opinion* ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-06, 23:57:29] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Hadn't considered this. Like it
[2023-11-06, 23:57:45] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Damn dude Gpt builder in natural language
[2023-11-06, 23:58:05] Aryaman (Strello): GPT overlords ftw
[2023-11-06, 23:58:44] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Team AI always have been. For future reference to said overlords 🤣
[2023-11-06, 23:58:47] ~ Utkarsh Saxena: Ah makes sense
[2023-11-06, 23:58:51] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Yeah agi ain't happening if they're busy with killing startups
[2023-11-06, 23:58:58] ~ Mayank Gupta: Anyone else wishing GPT was open protocols like HTTP and all? So any system from outside can also hit it? ‎<This message was edited>
‎[2023-11-06, 23:59:14] Rohit Aggarwal: ‎image omitted
[2023-11-06, 23:59:17] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: That's an interesting idea
[2023-11-06, 23:59:19] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: GPT Builder is a prompt builder.
[2023-11-06, 23:59:33] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: GPT Builderrr
[2023-11-06, 23:59:48] ~ Sudarshan: This is a little.... underwhelming
[2023-11-07, 00:00:27] ~ Amit Sharma: Maybe they want to keep tabs on industry/commercial traction to guide research...
[2023-11-07, 00:00:27] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Insightful. AutoGen is a step. They have backup
[2023-11-07, 00:00:28] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: Yeah, I also had the same feeling. It’s a product that puts together lot of existing ingredients
[2023-11-07, 00:00:33] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Dynamic Prompt builder +Agent Scratchpad+Agent Tools

Not exactly building GPT
[2023-11-07, 00:01:20] Rohit Aggarwal: Will they allow monetising this?
[2023-11-07, 00:01:24] Pratyush Choudhury: Slack as well, over Teams
[2023-11-07, 00:02:06] Ankur Pandey: C.f. MetaGPT wrt latest example by Sama
[2023-11-07, 00:02:23] ~ Kaustubh: He hasn't yet expanded GPT yet.
[2023-11-07, 00:02:31] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Launching gpt store with revenue sharing
[2023-11-07, 00:02:49] ~ Sudarshan: I think we would all be well advised to not open LinkedIn for the next few days to stay away from the _OPENAI JUST KILLED THOUSANDS OF STARTUPS, HERES HOW_ takes
[2023-11-07, 00:03:35] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: Also part of twitter crowd too 😂
[2023-11-07, 00:03:48] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: Yc advice was all these companies are building AGI but it's not the priority I guess for them
[2023-11-07, 00:03:55] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Did they just kill Langchain ?
[2023-11-07, 00:03:59] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Wow.
[2023-11-07, 00:04:10] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: they did
[2023-11-07, 00:04:15] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: No improved it I feel
[2023-11-07, 00:04:37] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Langchain will just build wrappers around  this
[2023-11-07, 00:04:47] Rohit Aggarwal: Yep
[2023-11-07, 00:05:12] Pratyush Choudhury: Should,
[2023-11-07, 00:05:15] Prakash Sankar Harbor: ya but I was already wondering I should use langchain, I have even less reason to now
[2023-11-07, 00:05:42] Ankur Pandey: @919899951010 told me that Harrison Chase was already regretting it! 😅
[2023-11-07, 00:05:56] Vedant Trivedi Sequoia: think they want the end consumers of apps to build whatever they want... is there value in building apps for others if it is so simple?
[2023-11-07, 00:06:00] ~ Pramod: Also bro showing off MacBook infront of satya nadella 😂
[2023-11-07, 00:06:07] Rohit Aggarwal: Arre Arre 😂
[2023-11-07, 00:06:20] Shagun Sood 2014G: Did I just see him using Cursor?
[2023-11-07, 00:06:22] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: And presenting demo using Chrome :p
[2023-11-07, 00:06:39] Shruthi Badri: They kind of said it pretty fast, but they said you could upload "knowledge for the model" - does that mean openai will handle RAG?
[2023-11-07, 00:06:53] Shruthi Badri: right at the start of the talk
[2023-11-07, 00:06:55] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Pretty sure Satya Nadella himself uses a mac in private lol
[2023-11-07, 00:07:08] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: They did say retrieval is part of the capabilities
[2023-11-07, 00:07:12] Shruthi Badri: he famously killed windows phone, saying that he uses the iphone and its way better
[2023-11-07, 00:07:14] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Seems like ,Retrieval Is capability of the Assistant API
[2023-11-07, 00:07:21] Ankur Pandey: Agent startup lindy.ai had recently raised 50 mil
[2023-11-07, 00:07:30] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: When is gpt4 turbo etc coming in api. Had anyone seen it?
[2023-11-07, 00:07:48] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Nice timing for them. Not for investors
[2023-11-07, 00:08:09] ~ Amit Sharma: This is massive for use cases
[2023-11-07, 00:08:30] Rohit Aggarwal: I'm thinking about NL2SQL becoming much simpler since I can just upload my SQL schema and go
[2023-11-07, 00:08:31] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Did he just say all chunking and retrieval strategies are handled by OpenAI ? 😂
[2023-11-07, 00:08:42] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Ya
[2023-11-07, 00:08:43] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: Stateful API!
[2023-11-07, 00:08:47] ~ Lohit: Yes, crazy. I can see that whoever is demoing this is using “cursor.sh” 🕹️.
[2023-11-07, 00:08:47] Rohit Aggarwal: Yea!
[2023-11-07, 00:08:51] Shagun Sood 2014G: Yup
[2023-11-07, 00:08:53] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I guess with agents you can now make function calls to other agents essentially making multi agent systems possible
[2023-11-07, 00:09:04] Shashwat TDC: Lol he did. And it's not a black-box. You can see it step by step 😂
[2023-11-07, 00:09:09] ~ YP: https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.00071
[2023-11-07, 00:09:21] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Code interpretor on API
[2023-11-07, 00:09:23] Anubhav mishra Zupay: 😂
[2023-11-07, 00:09:32] ~ Kaustubh: thanks
[2023-11-07, 00:09:38] Anubhav mishra Zupay: 20 more companies ded
[2023-11-07, 00:09:59] Shashwat TDC: Haha never regretted moving out of text2sql. 😆
[2023-11-07, 00:09:59] Shagun Sood 2014G: Sam Altman is taking ideas from YC startup’s and adding them into GPT
[2023-11-07, 00:10:15] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: What will be really valuable if someone can replicate all these capabilities on OSS
[2023-11-07, 00:10:21] ~ Amit Sharma: Build in public 😜
[2023-11-07, 00:10:26] Rohit Aggarwal: State, tools, rag, code interpreter, functions, multi-modal
[2023-11-07, 00:10:31] Rohit Aggarwal: Wow!
[2023-11-07, 00:10:41] Anubhav mishra Zupay: They are lobbying too bro see what Andrew Ng has to say ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-07, 00:11:04] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: He uses cursor
[2023-11-07, 00:11:15] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: Just saw the icon
[2023-11-07, 00:11:53] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: Didn’t follow at the start but can you do function calling with the Vision API?
[2023-11-07, 00:12:02] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Web browsing agents are ded
[2023-11-07, 00:12:04] Harsh Gupta Felvin: Very cool annocements
[2023-11-07, 00:12:05] Harsh Gupta Felvin: Is GPT-4 turbo available on API already?
[2023-11-07, 00:12:24] Anubhav mishra Zupay: He's doing it with whisper right now lol ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-07, 00:12:28] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Crazy dude
[2023-11-07, 00:12:32] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: BROO WHAT WAS THAT
[2023-11-07, 00:12:37] ~ Mayank Gupta: This one was pretty cool
[2023-11-07, 00:12:51] ~ Mayank Gupta: GPT Builder with function calling is kickass
[2023-11-07, 00:13:04] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: BRUHH
[2023-11-07, 00:13:13] Anubhav mishra Zupay: This is awesome man
[2023-11-07, 00:13:38] ~ Aman: Did someone win the credits here? 😂😂
[2023-11-07, 00:13:56] ~ Amit Sharma: Youtube waalon ko bhi milega?
[2023-11-07, 00:14:01] ~ Kaustubh: Isn't Assistant an app over GPTs?
[2023-11-07, 00:14:25] ~ Aman: I meant someone attending the dev day from here
[2023-11-07, 00:14:45] ~ Amit Sharma: Of course. 😆
[2023-11-07, 00:15:08] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Assistant is a vector db api and a history server api
[2023-11-07, 00:15:54] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: okay now open source gpt-3.5 weights please
[2023-11-07, 00:16:15] Shashwat TDC: Lol why do you want to read a huge .CSV file 😂 ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-07, 00:16:27] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Classy Keynote must say
[2023-11-07, 00:16:29] ~ Arsalaan: Where's gpt5?
[2023-11-07, 00:16:30] ~ Kaustubh: Yeah but didn't GPTs also have this access?
[2023-11-07, 00:16:45] ~ YP: Oh wow
[2023-11-07, 00:16:53] ~ YP: It was good one
[2023-11-07, 00:16:59] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Gpts is no code.
Assistants is API
[2023-11-07, 00:17:17] ~ Kaustubh: Got it
[2023-11-07, 00:18:00] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Marketplace for GPTs
That’s just seems like monetising prompts ? ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-07, 00:18:04] Jaskamal Kainth 2013: Probably ready and locked until they run out of steam with gpt4, turbo, etc 😅
[2023-11-07, 00:18:24] Anil Chandra Naidu Matcha: pinecone dead ?
[2023-11-07, 00:18:58] Shashwat TDC: Wait this was live? Can't rewatch it? 

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=U9mJuUkhUzk
[2023-11-07, 00:19:02] Anubhav mishra Zupay: GPTs
[2023-11-07, 00:19:13] Aryaman (Strello): Open source would always prevail
[2023-11-07, 00:19:23] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Available on YouTube channel
[2023-11-07, 00:19:42] Abhishek Maiti: They didnt reveal the rev sharing model, did they?
[2023-11-07, 00:20:27] Vignesh Baskaran: Thank you very much to all threadbois on "OpenAI just killed a million startups" post from tomorrow onwards 😂
[2023-11-07, 00:20:35] Shashwat TDC: Can u share link? Don't think they enabled save video post livestreaming.
[2023-11-07, 00:20:43] Yash OpenMined: what i figured from this keynote is now that they have integrated all input modalities+separate models (in a unified product/api) it will only help them refine their future AGI product
[2023-11-07, 00:21:01] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: You can rewind on this link :
https://www.youtube.com/live/U9mJuUkhUzk?si=mXX8_ckrDzt0Hpt0
[2023-11-07, 00:21:57] Debdoot Meesho: Will we have API access to get embedding from GPT4 vision where can get multimodal embeddings?
[2023-11-07, 00:21:59] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: Is OpenAI research not proceeding as expected?

Everything they shipped today has been out via other libraries since couple of months
[2023-11-07, 00:22:00] Rajesh Kumar SA : It's going to be an explosion of agents
[2023-11-07, 00:22:30] Yash OpenMined: i doubt they are even focusing on this
[2023-11-07, 00:22:39] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Everybody needs a relaxing time once in a while 🤣
[2023-11-07, 00:22:51] ~ Amit Sharma: They're embellishing their training dataset for 5 by opening up retrieval through APIs
[2023-11-07, 00:23:02] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: There’s also couple more points to think if you consider some rumours
-OpenAI knew about and had developed agents and related capabilities much before anyone else,almost a year back 
-Their training run for “Arrakis” failed 

So it would look like this dev day is more like their backup roadmap
[2023-11-07, 00:23:14] Shashwat TDC: Oh it starts at 30:00 got it.
[2023-11-07, 00:23:14] Ankur Pandey: The "safe" AI startups are in old school / boring / hard to enter / red tapish domains. Cc @919740361920 @917880067859
[2023-11-07, 00:23:42] ~ Arsalaan: Hopefully
[2023-11-07, 00:23:53] Rajesh Kumar SA : Looks like they want to abstract out embedding and make it part of GPTs or assistant API - they did not talk about embedding API at all
[2023-11-07, 00:24:14] Aditya Agrawal: I always that.. have been saying that for long.
[2023-11-07, 00:24:52] Shashwat TDC: I wudnt be surprised, given competition capabilities
[2023-11-07, 00:24:59] Aditya Agrawal: Thanks @917022155324 for pointing it out
[2023-11-07, 00:27:07] ~ Siva: Assistant API, Agent Store - Seems the developer work itself changing. Adoption of this by the leading tools and Enterprises will speed the transition faster.
[2023-11-07, 00:28:37] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Word
[2023-11-07, 00:28:45] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: Is GPT-4 Turbo available to everyone? Assistant API shows up
[2023-11-07, 00:28:55] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: ‎This message was deleted.
[2023-11-07, 00:29:03] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: E/acc
[2023-11-07, 00:29:40] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: If ppl thought tech moved fast already just wait . In 1-2 years keeping up without AI will
Be hard . It creates its own demand
[2023-11-07, 00:30:05] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Everyone in this group is strappped to a giant rocket
[2023-11-07, 00:30:09] ~ Arpit: Have they rolled out gpt builder/agents?
[2023-11-07, 00:30:18] ~ Amit Sharma: The pace of innovation is counter-productive for enterprises. The CIO's or CAIO's will be terrified of losing their job because they know that betting 10 MM on a framework which might get redundant in next 3-6 month. All this means is more PoC's, more Pilots
‎[2023-11-07, 00:31:38] ~ YP: ‎image omitted
[2023-11-07, 00:31:45] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: New releases will be rolling out after 1 PM PST
[2023-11-07, 00:31:48] ~ YP: just went to platform.openai.com
[2023-11-07, 00:31:51] ~ YP: Yes
[2023-11-07, 00:33:05] Ankur Pandey: More scope for AI consulting/service startups
[2023-11-07, 00:33:10] Anubhav mishra Zupay: We're at a time when even the big tech and big companies have to move and follow the fail fast strategy
[2023-11-07, 00:33:28] ~ Amit Sharma: Yes.
[2023-11-07, 00:33:31] Shashwat TDC: Yes. So much of volatility is never helpful. It creates confusion. Maybe also the reason for poor adoption across the orgs and its users, unless it's a write an email usecase.
[2023-11-07, 00:34:42] Shashwat TDC: Bigger than Data Science consulting for sure. Everyone wants to evaluate AI solutions so that they can depriortize it to next quarter without any fomo 🌚
[2023-11-07, 00:35:13] Vignesh Baskaran: Is anyone trying out Assistant API?
https://platform.openai.com/docs/api-reference/assistants/createAssistant?lang=curl
[2023-11-07, 00:35:15] ~ Amit Sharma: It creates huge issues inside large orgs where adjacent/overlapping teams are always looking for one-upmanship opportunities.
[2023-11-07, 00:36:03] Ankur Pandey: Check this https://www.linkedin.com/posts/ankurpandey42_gitex-dubai-generativeai-activity-7121517489506648064-uvGF?utm_source=share&utm_medium=member_android

[2023-11-07, 00:40:13] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: I think you need to get the latest openai library
[2023-11-07, 00:41:19] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Did they just kill LangChain
[2023-11-07, 00:41:36] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: You absolutely don’t need it anymore for many use cases if this works
[2023-11-07, 00:41:37] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: more or less, yes
[2023-11-07, 00:41:49] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: We hardly knew ye
[2023-11-07, 00:41:51] Aman Dreamboat.ai: All announcements here
https://openai.com/blog/new-models-and-developer-products-announced-at-devday
[2023-11-07, 00:42:52] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: One  big winner will be intercom
[2023-11-07, 00:43:03] Vignesh Baskaran: Did that
[2023-11-07, 00:43:50] Aryaman (Strello): How so?
[2023-11-07, 00:44:27] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: All their customers can very easily build assistants if intercom builds some slight enhancements and taps into existing ontology etc
[2023-11-07, 00:44:40] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Will automate support massively saving money for clients
[2023-11-07, 00:45:14] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: I work in this domain and if I had this API I can easily see handling 20-30 % of current volumes
[2023-11-07, 00:45:29] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: This is a billions of dollars market
[2023-11-07, 00:45:38] ~ Amit Sharma: Their integration of AI into existing product and pricing strategy has been best (that I've seen) so far
[2023-11-07, 00:45:59] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Yeah they will jump on this sure
[2023-11-07, 00:46:52] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Also you can have like - give me your e-commerce catalog and API and I will give you a sales bot. Intercom can extend this way too
[2023-11-07, 00:46:56] ~ Amit Sharma: They can get into low end (L1), routine BPO market segment viz huge
[2023-11-07, 00:47:40] ~ Vijay RPS: Yes reduce the work and hard to find ppl to do the work
[2023-11-07, 00:48:10] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: isn't it slightly counter intuitive to assume GenAI services will scale?

Does these products make it easier for pilots to be run internally?
[2023-11-07, 00:48:27] ~ Amit Sharma: Directionally very neg for Indian IT/ITeS as a whole
[2023-11-07, 00:49:05] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Agreed
[2023-11-07, 00:49:10] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: BPO
[2023-11-07, 00:49:47] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Ed tech can also do a lot with this assistants api
[2023-11-07, 00:50:14] Aman Dreamboat.ai: Langchain just announced
OpenGPTs
Trying to keep up with OpenAi GPTs plus offering support for other LLMs too

https://github.com/langchain-ai/opengpts
[2023-11-07, 00:50:17] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Thinking where instead the local math sir taking tuiton he will sell a bot
[2023-11-07, 00:51:35] Amit Tiwary: White knight positioning
[2023-11-07, 00:51:49] Shashwat TDC: Absolutely. That's is the future.
[2023-11-07, 00:52:01] ~ Vijay RPS: When anyone can do this what will differentiate market leader from rest?just how creative one is?

[2023-11-07, 01:20:31] Vignesh Baskaran: Genuinely, there is no reason for any GenAI startup to panic. We first need to experiment with and evaluate the performance of each newly released feature from OpenAI before drawing a conclusion. Just because it's OpenAI doesn't mean they will be the best. 

For instance, on the day OpenAI introduced the Web browsing feature, my LinkedIn feed overflowed with claims that "Perplexity is dead, OpenAI has just massacred Perplexity." However, the reality was that Perplexity's traffic actually soared exponentially because the Web browsing feature from OpenAI was underwhelming.

 Therefore, if we build a good product that solves a genuine customer problem, we will succeed. Because customers care about  whether their problem is solved or not. They don't care about whether its OpenAI or a small statup ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-07, 08:50:17] Jaskamal Kainth 2013: Hi all,

I'm using an approximate k-nearest neighbors (k-NN) algorithm to retrieve the top similar documents. Now, if I want to further narrow down the search results based on relevance, how can I limit the number of documents?

It is possible to use the scores associated with these documents and select only the top ones before the scores drop significantly.
Keeping a threshold is another option but selecting the best threshold is pain.
Another option is to do post filtering on some field but what if this field doesn't exist?
Like in case of news search, we can post filter on news category, etc.

All these solutions I have in mind, but is there any other better solution?

[2023-11-07, 10:56:06] Nirant K: Even more relevant, longer the context - more people will use it, so more people will want better ranking

[2023-11-07, 10:58:10] ~ Sandya Saravanan: Umm, I would sort of think, given that yu have larger context space compared to what is available today, one could get by even if yu don't have the optimal ranking? - Sort of like you don't care what you put in cache so much when your L3 cache size is so large
[2023-11-07, 10:59:41] Ruchir GenAI Security: But for RAG on large knowledge bases (not used in training), user data, real time internet data etc. a large context length makes RAG more useful right?
[2023-11-07, 11:00:33] Arko C | xylem.ai: A larger context length doesn’t help with better results most of the time. LLMs tend to focus more to the start and end of the context provided anyway. Kinda overlooks a lot on the major chunk in the middle.
[2023-11-07, 11:01:13] ~ Sandya Saravanan: yes, definitely, but imo, there would be many cases today where RAG is getting used because of low context size, and RAG is critical, As context sizes grow, the "squeezing to get the best results given limited context length" may not be that critical?
[2023-11-07, 11:01:35] ~ Sandya Saravanan: yes there was a paper on that, and I thought there was some work that tried to address it also
[2023-11-07, 11:03:07] Arko C | xylem.ai: But then that in a way is linked with the nature of LLMs. The same one that causes them to hallucinate. The more the context, the more variations for the model to interpret something.

The solid usecases for vector DBs mentioned in the thread will remain (and hence their usage), but the large number of incidental users of a vector db like Pinecone (for plug and play RAG apps, langchain demos, etc.) will reduce
[2023-11-07, 17:30:12] Kaushik Bokka: https://github.com/openai/openai-python/releases

[2023-11-07, 17:31:40] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Embeddings existed for long before RAG made them useful with real applications. Fancy research and nuance ML use cases won't change TAM much.

[2023-11-07, 18:29:09] Vignesh Baskaran: Why would companies choose open-source LLMs over OpenAI APIs, aside from societal benefits and cost considerations, given the latest OpenAI developments? Are there strong incentives for this preference?
[2023-11-07, 18:29:32] Pratyush Choudhury: For specific tasks, costs?
[2023-11-07, 18:32:39] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: You wont scale. You wont have complete control over the outputs. How much ever they tell it's safe and stuff, its still a blackbox. OpenAI goes down, you go down. You wont be the owner of the costs for inference, they will be. They will have the moat. You'll rely on them even for Mission critical applications.
[2023-11-07, 18:32:53] C Chaitanya: Costs and control. For us, the pipeline is OpenAI for prototyping and seeing what sticks with customers. Once we have a market fit, try to move it to smaller models which we can control. We have been able to do this for most use cases. Summarization is one place where we still use OpenAI APIs(3.5 turbo)
[2023-11-07, 18:36:07] Pratyush Choudhury: I don't agree with this actually

Spoken to enough folks on various levels and scales to understand the need. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-07, 18:39:56] Arko C | xylem.ai: The Dev Day doesn’t change their needs and concerns
[2023-11-07, 18:40:09] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: It's high for now. It'll reduce drastically as time goes on. Even I've talked with a few clients(Indian) and they just don't trust their data going out on API's and are willing to go to lengths of going bare metal on prem.
[2023-11-07, 18:42:31] Arko C | xylem.ai: Australia, UAE and India
[2023-11-07, 18:43:11] Vignesh Baskaran: Got it Arko! I am curious to learn how US and EU enterprises are thinking through this
[2023-11-07, 18:44:06] Arko C | xylem.ai: Based on my conversations earlier, prior to DevDay, the concerns were the same. Just the timelines seemed slacked off in EU.
[2023-11-07, 18:46:56] Arko C | xylem.ai: Atleast based on the wedge we cater to.

Context:
Our platform is being built to get custom/fine-tuned LLMs that you own IP of with docker image generation for VPC deployments on any cloud and even multi cloud, and in any region. The only service layer will be the bare metal deployments but again, we can do that too for enterprises. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-07, 18:48:34] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: (1) If you understand enterprise  customer’s requirements, RAG+3.5 level model are good enough
(2) They understand value of their data so they want to own models after training
(3) Most of them have multi tenant cloud setup
(4) cost of GPT4 is still high for b2b2c applications when customers don’t know habits of their customers and value add, hence most of them are in pilot
[2023-11-07, 18:51:29] Anubhav mishra Zupay: How many are bullish on the GPTs and the GPT store? 

Do you think it can scale up ? What's the timeline you think it will show signs of actual success
[2023-11-07, 18:52:29] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: An enterprise customer who can’t even serve their own manuals with CoPilots, don’t care about Agents
[2023-11-07, 18:53:24] ~ akp: Could be a distribution experiment in consumer
[2023-11-07, 18:56:06] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Regulatory. That's the only reason. The whole market for private LLMs is arround regulations and privacy. Mind you that's a 100 billion dollar market - cos we have all banks and Pharma (atleast) under it.

If you don't fall under it ..zero reason to use private llm
[2023-11-07, 18:58:21] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Something I’m thinking about is how productive OpenAI is overall. And whether they use their own tools really well to achieve that speed
[2023-11-07, 18:58:39] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Their execution speed is as miraculous as GPT-4 itself .
[2023-11-07, 18:59:10] Vignesh Baskaran: Very fair Sandeep. But  won't OpenAI/Microsoft will offer this via their enterprise plans?
[2023-11-07, 18:59:14] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: They must have really good ppl too.
[2023-11-07, 19:00:12] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Easier said than done
[2023-11-07, 19:00:46] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Won't pass audit. I had to personally convince the RBI that AWS Mumbai is earthquake safe since it has only one datacenter in Mumbai.
Audit failed twice cos of this. People underestimate how hard compliance is.
[2023-11-07, 19:01:49] ~ romit: Isn’t that true for AWS also? Still everyone uses them
[2023-11-07, 19:02:09] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Having said that , that's precisely why OpenAI is doing custom models. So it's a "service business" versus product business.

Lots of wedges and slices to that market. OpenAI will take same ...u can take some too
[2023-11-07, 19:02:16] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: This is no longer IP game
[2023-11-07, 19:02:28] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Hey look...data scientists have a job again!

[2023-11-07, 19:03:33] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: It was surprising for them to jump into service business. They must be thinking about growing the team 10x otherwise it is not scalable for small teams. May be OpenAI certified/approved service companies are coming soon.
[2023-11-07, 19:03:43] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: I was very happy when OpenAI announced custom model training. It means it wasn't able to break into these kinds of markets. Fair game now
[2023-11-07, 19:05:12] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Kya margins hai ye.
[2023-11-07, 19:06:02] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I think this has potential. But a word of caution because plugins wasn't as useful
[2023-11-07, 19:08:11] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: They pay almost 1M TC for some of those resources
[2023-11-07, 19:08:18] Arko C | xylem.ai: It's true. Banks, Pharma, Healthcare, Govt. all have similar concerns. Most businesses atleast that we spoke to, asked us about model ownership on first call itself.

And SaaS companies serving enterprise clients will also require these models as their customers want VPC or bare metal deployments.

Many engineering and ML teams have been affirming with the notion that they wish to over time move to smaller LLMs for domain specific use cases running under the hood of a routing logic.

Then costs.
[2023-11-07, 19:09:13] Arko C | xylem.ai: Bhai the engineers to build custom models are expensive. Basically paying for man power at this point.
[2023-11-07, 19:09:30] ~ Anuruddh: It’s an interesting usecase discovery experiment for them, but I don’t see how it can hold against products built to solve the same problem deeply.

There was an example i saw floating around of a AI GPT to help with pets. Taking that problem as an example, someone will come and solve it better than anything that’ll be available on the gpt store.
[2023-11-07, 19:09:51] Arko C | xylem.ai: Hardly few thousand globally who can figure shit out and build real stuff
[2023-11-07, 19:10:13] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Hmm. Ya since they're pre-training and RLHF on their own time this can make sense
[2023-11-07, 19:11:20] Nirant K: While I agree that compliance is expensive, I'm old enough to remember that all countries wanted their own data centers — they all have a "region" in a major cloud now. Technical difficulty and costs can buy enough time for existing clouds here too
[2023-11-07, 19:13:37] Karthik S Delhivery: You don’t want to give openAI wholesale transfer pricing power (read up tren griffin on this topic. Rather insightful) over your product
[2023-11-07, 19:13:45] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Public cloud has been there for 18+ years, I’m not sure adaptation has crossed 50% yet. I may be wrong but the number can be even lower. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-07, 19:14:40] Nirant K: I also don't want to give 50% of my income to Union Govt, but we pay the price we can negotiate
[2023-11-07, 19:17:51] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Philosophically nice...but not sellable. Lots of stuff like this. Salesforce for example. 
Regulatory boundaries are a genuine sales case. Biden is making it worse. Go do kyc for every data scientist touching ur data.

[2023-11-07, 22:46:27] ~ Anirudh Mittal: New member, sorry if I am repeating this:
Are there any insights on how long context window works vs RAG? If my entire database can be given as the context, can it perform better than RAG in any case?
[2023-11-07, 22:52:20] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: So there are few things to consider here
1. First , LLMs have the problem where instruction and context in top and bottom are prioritized and improtant context in middle gets lost, and this happens in context length over 16k tokens maybe even lesser, need to read literature again.
2. So its important to have relevant context and more importantly ranked context as well helps. 
3. Then you have costs, putting a lot of context will also add to cost which over scale is expensive over reranking and filtering out via embeddings
So while 128k context is actually helpful and in many cases you can put an entire file and get great results equivalent to RAG, over many domains RAG will help
Also to note, different type of text means different cost of tokens as well

[2023-11-07, 23:08:54] Harsh Maheshwari GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: Are there any good multimodal embedding models which could be used to get embedding for image+text together?
[2023-11-07, 23:18:58] Srinivas Rao Jami: Blip2 and imagebind (non commercial) are definitely worth looking
[2023-11-07, 23:19:09] ~ Aman: Didn't do a lot of experiments, so can't say for sure.
1. The latency is almost the same, but OpenAI's time to first byte seemed to be slightly faster with the opus file format than eleven labs.
2. The voice stability between sentences sounded more consistent for OpenAI, but mostly will be replicable with elevenlabs on tweaking the voice settings.

Possibly some kind of query rerouting ? (So certain types of questions can be answered by a specific subset of documents )

[2023-11-08, 13:05:12] Vignesh Baskaran: Folks, I have structured data in formats like SQL DB and unstructured data in PDFs. I want to merge these different data sources and build a RAG on top of them. Could you please direct me to any Python library that can do this? 

P.S. I am familiar with the LLamaIndex Knowledge Graph Demo. Would like to know if there are anyother resources that you have found interesting. Thank you very much.
[2023-11-08, 13:10:01] Nirant K: cc @919550164716 we've been discussing this 1-1 — I suspect high performance data agents as a service is quite useful. Even better with an Open core, since it can then be adapted as new tech and tools emerge ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-08, 13:10:53] ~ Prateek🖤: I would suggest looking up Haystack  and/or pathway.
[2023-11-08, 13:13:04] Nirant K: What's pathway? If it's not too much to ask, would you mind sharing a link and why you'd recommend it?
[2023-11-08, 13:16:01] Ankur Pandey: Following
[2023-11-08, 13:22:06] ~ Sumit: I'm building a managed service that does exactly this, takes care of the data ingestion// retrieval so that you can write the final generation part.
[2023-11-08, 13:23:22] ~ Sumit: My hypothesis is that will be more important for doing RAG at scale, not for a few local documents.
[2023-11-08, 13:23:51] Nirant K: Something like Indexify?
[2023-11-08, 13:28:42] ~ Sumit: Oh yes indexify looks very similar. We will be adding a lot of data connectors so that plugging your knowledge base into our service is as easy as possible. Not sure if indexify has that from a quick look at the docs.
[2023-11-08, 13:30:13] ~ Sumit: You can check it out at useturbine.com. We want to be as flexible as possible, and become a developer first infrastructure platform. Bring your own data sources, API keys, etc and let us do the real-time data ingestion in a distributed parallelised way. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-08, 13:31:20] ~ Sumit: Still figuring out the amount of customizations people need// don't need from their retrieval engine. Any input regarding the same would be highly valuable @everyone
[2023-11-08, 13:31:40] Nirant K: Looks like they've left place for adding services/integrations as well: https://github.com/diptanu/indexify
[2023-11-08, 13:32:20] Nirant K: The challenge with such services is often they'd converge to Vespa's design challenges, the long way i.e. you need to solve for ranking, while your core codebase does retrieval or something else. 
[2023-11-08, 13:35:15] ~ Sumit: Interesting. But what if the platform does everything around retrieval, i.e. re-ranking is also something taken care of by the platform.
[2023-11-08, 13:36:26] Nirant K: Not enough folks want to pay the orchestration or generalisation overhead if retrieval and ranking are separated. Most folks see them as a combined "search" problem
[2023-11-08, 13:37:19] ~ Sumit: The current landing page of Turbine is a bit outdated, but the product vision I have is that it will take care of everything around retrieval or search, in an industry standard way. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-08, 13:38:20] ~ Sumit: Yes you're right. I think I didn't communicate correctly, I am planning to build a combined "search" platform, not just a ETL platform.
[2023-11-08, 13:39:22] ~ Sumit: But yes you're right, the moment they have dig-in manually and do some processing around the data// search result, the value proposition of the platform becomes lesser.
[2023-11-08, 13:40:25] Nirant K: I see you support Chroma and not Qdrant, which is actually used by industry like Twitter/X. I'm hurt.

As a reminder, we *remove folks who've not had a chance to participate in the most recent 60 days*.

A minor change is that you'll get removed from ALL the groups in the WhatsApp community if you're lurking here since we have the hit the limits on the WhatsApp Community as well.

[2023-11-08, 15:40:27] Ambika Computational Mama: ok i will rephrase in detail:
The embeddings retrieves highly technical data, and system prompt needs to give step by step answers. So the answers become too huge. We have tried many of these tricks but irinically they are coming short 😂

[2023-11-08, 20:04:56] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: It depends on what modality do you care about. For example, audio + facial expressions is a multimodal problem. Or text + audio events + video for scene understanding

[2023-11-08, 20:32:13] Ankur Pandey: API?
[2023-11-08, 20:36:37] Rohit Aggarwal: weren’t they accused of using data generated from openai to train their own models sometime back?
[2023-11-08, 20:37:06] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: What was the accusation ? That they did it right ? 🤣
[2023-11-08, 20:37:14] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I think they might using openai at the backend also 😂
[2023-11-08, 20:38:05] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Azure Open AI is working I guess
[2023-11-08, 20:38:32] Priyesh OnFinance: Yes
[2023-11-08, 20:38:32] Rohit Aggarwal: yes, that is up
[2023-11-08, 20:38:48] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Correct, for us it's not down 💪
[2023-11-08, 20:43:16] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: The thing that you realize in these times is what features do users use the most.
[2023-11-08, 20:46:09] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Anthropic is also throwing 529 from time to time
[2023-11-08, 20:46:59] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Which means anthropic is using roblox servers
[2023-11-08, 20:47:33] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I did not understand this leap. Wanna explain ?
[2023-11-08, 20:49:13] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: So different services like cloudflare roblox nginx have unique error codes in case of certain errors especially when the issue is at server end
[2023-11-08, 20:49:48] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Nginx has 502 cloudflare has 524 I think. 529 is a roblox server error.
[2023-11-08, 20:50:03] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Intriguing thanks for sharing
[2023-11-08, 20:50:37] Harsh Maheshwari GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: I want to ultimately have a multimodal based retrieval system. It's given that I will always have text as well as image as input.
[2023-11-08, 20:50:47] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Cloudflare had a massive outage last week. Openai uses cloudflare. Not sure if they are connected. Currently all errors openai is throwing are 429
[2023-11-08, 20:51:50] Harsh Maheshwari GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: Image bind is more useful in bringing to the same embedding space (among image, text, audio etc) but not useful when I want to jointly represent image+text
[2023-11-08, 20:53:56] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: So you are saying I still can't hear how the model truly learns the sound of the colour blue via ImageBind ?
[2023-11-08, 20:55:02] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: For this
[2023-11-08, 20:55:03] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: This is the answer
[2023-11-08, 20:55:07] Ruchir GenAI Security: Not sure if someone has shared this here already or not - https://state-of-llm.streamlit.app

Quite interesting insights, though I guess this is a better representation of the state of llm experimentation rather than production given the source of the data
[2023-11-08, 20:56:20] Yash OpenMined: Unlikely this isn’t a proxy error and last week’s downtime will not trickle down right now
[2023-11-08, 20:56:47] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: Oh we did this at Facebook to reduce word error rates and improve endpointing latency. The model jointly learned audio and facial expressions of speakers. It reduced WER in most languages by a few percent for short speech segments.
[2023-11-08, 20:56:50] Yash OpenMined: Plus they categorized it as a major outage with 429 (rate limited) so it’s a major infrastructure issue
[2023-11-08, 20:57:28] Yash OpenMined: Based on my aws/azure experience this might last 6+ hours
[2023-11-08, 20:57:40] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Anything out in the open I can learn more from?
[2023-11-08, 20:59:01] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: There was a recent paper from FAIR which talks about learning 4 modalities together. Our training strategy was similar.
[2023-11-08, 20:59:29] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Is it ImageBind ? Or something else ??
[2023-11-08, 21:00:04] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: My question about what modality you care about was because your solutions would vary based on what you are trying to do. Multimodal comes in various shapes :)
[2023-11-08, 21:00:24] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Agreed.
[2023-11-08, 21:11:27] Shashank Generative AI Group: it's funny coz back in 2011, Google honey-trapped Bing by making up some words, search terms and Bing was caught copying their search results.

[2023-11-08, 23:47:03] ~ Ajay: I'm trying to find whether an object exists in an image. That is given a set of images, I want to find those images where a specific object exists. As an example, the object can be "dog" and I want to find all the images where the dog exists. Has anyone tried to solve this problem? Does Imagebind + faiss with cosine similarly work well?

[2023-11-08, 23:54:38] ~ Ajay: The problem is every image will need to be compared against the text at inference time. An embedding search is much more efficienct even if it also includes a few wrong results.

[2023-11-09, 00:16:08] naras GenAI WhatsApp Group: Ah got it. This approach won't scale then
CLIP/Llava to describe the image might be a better approach. You'll be comparing again text at runtime

[2023-11-09, 01:37:52] Vamshi: I suddenly see a new GPT called “sous chef”, not sure if it just enables things based on usage - or does everyone get random things.

But no access to create new GPTs…
[2023-11-09, 01:46:42] ~ Sudarshan: Do you all store the associated metadata (that wouldn't be relevant for search purposes) of a chunk in the vector DB itself or only store the required text content + vector and store the metadata in a traditional DB (while maintaining a unique identifier to link the relational DB with the vector DB). For instance a property like last date that a document was updated might not be relevant for search but is important to keep track of when re-indexing.

Below the last user message add this note
[Important: Respond within X characters]
[2023-11-09, 09:46:52] ~ Palash: As GPT values start and end parts of the context more
[2023-11-09, 09:48:25] ~ Aniket Singh: got you, thanks palash. Will definitely try this out
[2023-11-09, 09:49:40] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: quick question: how can we measure if a llm generated response is hallucinated or not?
[2023-11-09, 09:52:57] ~ Aniket Singh: Manually, i think by reading through the content to check if it is fine and in line with the prompts 

Another way could be to do the same by another call to gpt, to analyse the text and ask it to check if the output is inline with the prompt
[2023-11-09, 10:03:45] ~ Khauneesh: In our case as well we have tried something of this sort as well, which is manual . If youir questions have some pattern like revenue or finance related but for different customers then you can generate answers and then pick a random sample and evaluate manually to see if answers generated are correct , compared to the original values.

In 2nd scenario you can deliberately ask questions for which you know answer is not there and see how many times it gives not sure or don’t know the answer as response, that way some evaluation  an be done for hallucinations
[2023-11-09, 10:06:04] ~ Bibek: Hi. I am looking for a web crawler really fast one for a website. Have someone got an experience in this?

[2023-11-09, 11:26:41] Priyesh OnFinance: but the decline is significant
[2023-11-09, 11:26:54] Priyesh OnFinance: and hence token efficient RAG is very important
[2023-11-09, 11:28:39] Arko C | xylem.ai: I mean that’s pretty logical cause that’s how LLMs behave.

Just longer context lengths aren’t enough.

Smaller context windows are actually much more accurate and exponentially better when paired with RAG
[2023-11-09, 11:28:48] ~ Sudarshan: 20% of total context length?

To start with, I do have questions around preparing the dataset (One example - consider lot of reusable modules in the repo; Reusable module used to be written only once but called many times.

Quite impressive 
Although I think the bigger challenge is in questions that require relatively complex reasoning/analysis. 
Would be good if someone did an analysis of how the model performance for varying levels of question difficulty levels

[2023-11-09, 13:35:10] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: The coding abilities are a bit better it seems. Vanilla GPT4 get lost in debugging loops because it couldn't implement the code correctly based on the tests. This one does much better, can clear tests at one go.

[2023-11-09, 16:48:52] Anubhav mishra Zupay: The GPT builder is pretty cool. 

My take 
I created an ASO copilot for our internal product/ marketing team. 

I used some benchmarking reports and industry standard docs for best practices and asked it to align and tell me what all changes are required in my copy, screenshots as well. 

Worked very well. Point by point it told what the standards and best practices say and changed and suggested accordingly. 

Insane man !

[2023-11-09, 19:18:43] Nirant K: I can’t say much, but I’d say that I did performance and more comparison and joined Qdrant.

[2023-11-09, 19:19:09] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: In fact I found this paper but it doesn't discuss relative merits, and although it does do a comparison of sorts it isn't comprehensive.

[2023-11-09, 19:21:47] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: On Azure Kubernetes for instance, you can set up stateful sets with Qdrant or Weaviate or other vector DBs, but having a managed service reduces headaches around management

[2023-11-09, 23:46:16] Pratyush Choudhury: Might sound counter intuitive and/or as a spicy take but here it goes: as we see more OSS models & task specific, smaller, focused models come up, we’ll see a lot of tech (ML & non-ML) problems being attempted using Generative AI/large AI models as basic primitives in 2024

We’ll see a lot of this being done next year, would be interesting to see how much of it sustains in 2025

[2023-11-09, 23:51:44] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Starting at llms and ending up at xgboost is still a win for most companies!
[2023-11-09, 23:53:27] Pratyush Choudhury: Yep, atleast they got started w/ something

Also, a non-technical (pure financial/economic) reason behind this is that Gen AI’s tech alters the economics of quite a bit of things
[2023-11-09, 23:56:00] Pratyush Choudhury: Certain things are now orders of magnitude cheaper than they were a few months ago - we are probably underestimating what implications it can have

For instance, dubbing videos takes $500k to $2M depending on a few factors, an 80-85% accurate result today is available in a fraction of the time at $1 price point 

There are massive economic incentives to pursue the long-tail to ensure that the 85% gets to 95 or even 99% and we’ll get there (I’m a tech optimist)
[2023-11-09, 23:56:52] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Lots of gatekeeping finally broken. A lot of  ML can be done by non-technical/not experienced in traditional ML folks.
[2023-11-09, 23:59:16] Pratyush Choudhury: Yep, let’s take BI (Business Intelligence) as an example - it’s a 20-25% penetrated business today

Imagine enabling companies to do BI using natural language - a lot of ad-hoc queries will become natural language enabled & probably BI will be a much larger market than it is today

[2023-11-10, 00:22:28] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yeah, I don't know why more people don't build simpler models. Many real world problems can be solved with logistic regression, MLR or ARIMA class models.
[2023-11-10, 00:24:39] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I have followed this for a while and I still am not convinced as to why you need an LLM to solve a forecasting problem. I would say that many forecasters that use deep net architectures may fall short of a simpler ARIMA/AR/MA model for most use cases.
[2023-11-10, 00:25:23] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Either that or everyone gangs up and slaps lawsuits on OpenAI, so they have to be in business at some point and pay for the data, I suppose

The AI pin from hu.ma.ne is out, the first LLM-native consumer hardware device. I think it's a great stride towards "ambient intelligence", where AI fades into the background and emerges naturally when you need it. I can imagine having the GPT app store streamed to the device, switching agents depending on the multimodal context around you at the moment.

The note-taking feature is awesome: I want to remember important conversations and contacts at conferences without explicitly typing notes on my phone. The privacy concerns are huge though, despite the safeguard mechanism. Google Glass was dead partially because of the social stigma. How will Humane AI pin perform in the mass market? I'm curious what you all think!
[2023-11-10, 09:27:56] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: I don't think google glass was killed because of social stigma or anything if I remember. They were very well ahead of their times back then and was an example of too early to the market. The same concept demoed by Google glass back then is now being tried by many folks around and also is being tried in the VR/AR headsets by meta folks (along with that glass experiment) now that ASR/STT/TTS has improved massively at-least for English. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-10, 10:49:11] Nirant K: Helping the world is a weird heuristic tbh. The guy who made the gas chamber to kill millions of Jews, also saved billions from starvation by making urea possible. Similarly, Mao wanted to help, and ended up killing millions.

Closer to home, I still continue to hold the view that Uber, SBI did more for urban women than decades of activism by assuring physical and financial safety

I used to never use it before but since the past few months I've been using it almost exclusively for dictating long texts. Pixel for example has a local model which is very fast and highly accurate as well. There is also an app, which allows you to use OpenAI's whisper models for speech to text on Android and it works on just about every phone. More accurate than Google but just a tad bit slower.

From the nyt profile[0], I thought self proclaimed gurus were an india only phenomenon :
"A Buddhist monk named Brother Spirit led them to Humane. Mr. Chaudhri and Ms. Bongiorno had developed concepts for two A.I. products: a women’s health device and the pin. Brother Spirit, whom they met through their acupuncturist, recommended that they share the ideas with his friend, Marc Benioff, the founder of Salesforce.
Sitting beneath a palm tree on a cliff above the ocean at Mr. Benioff’s Hawaiian home in 2018, they explained both devices. “This one,” Mr. Benioff said, pointing at the Ai Pin, as dolphins breached the surf below, “is huge.” "

[2023-11-10, 13:00:35] Nirant K: Tried to edit, let's see if it gets updated
[2023-11-10, 13:00:56] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: So I was just wondering how do you manage schema and data migrations across different environments. Also weaving doesn't allow modifying lot of the configuration, like for example if I have to change the embedding model, I need to delete the class and recreate it. Or modify data type of existing property, currently its not supported.
[2023-11-10, 13:03:42] ~ Sudarshan: Been dealing with the same problems, and honestly migrations have been a bit of a pain
Wondering if we should just move to a system where we store just the vectors/text in Weaviate and any other relevant properties/metadata we maintain in a Postgre DB
[2023-11-10, 13:05:28] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: @917737887058 does Qdrant  have good migration story or it suffers from same challenges
[2023-11-10, 13:05:47] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Guys if you're finding any new GPT that people have created and have given an open link to try , do share if you're finding anything interesting on X
[2023-11-10, 13:06:30] Anubhav mishra Zupay: https://chat.openai.com/g/g-KkxbQAVuk-playlistai-spotify

Someone created a GPT that lets you create a Spotify playlist for any prompt
[2023-11-10, 13:08:54] Nirant K: We've a clean snapshot export which can be migrated however you like. It's not perfect in our opinion, and we're working on that
[2023-11-10, 13:10:45] Nirant K: We've helped migrate some really bigco, one of the AI ones you've definitely used
[2023-11-10, 13:11:12] Nirant K: And we've migrated some from one cloud to another as well
[2023-11-10, 13:11:26] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: I actually meant schema migration not migrating from QDrant -> basically say I want to change model used for embedding and re-embed everything -> in weaviate, I need to delete the class, recreate a new class  and reindex existing documents/rows myself . this is true for lot of other schema stuff like for example changing data type of another column.
[2023-11-10, 13:12:21] Nirant K: Hmm. I think it'd depend on what you're calling schema, Qdrant doesn't have a concept of a schema. Let's discuss on DM or Qdrant discord?
[2023-11-10, 13:14:58] ~ Sudarshan: I think more generally — why should vector databases deal with these complications if their primary functionality is to allow for fast vector search?
[2023-11-10, 13:18:51] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: I mean , haven't checked Qdrant in detail but one of core promise for Weaviate is that it combines object store with a vector store and with a predefined schema. Hence schema migration is an important consideration. I have been using it as a secondary db for supporting search and hence in my use case schema migration do become important
[2023-11-10, 13:20:05] Nirant K: This makes sense. Weaviate is making a promise here to manage schemas, something Qdrant and a few others don’t.
[2023-11-10, 13:21:34] Nirant K: We call this a collection, and we believe Qdrant should not limit or decide specific columns/payload design.
[2023-11-10, 13:22:52] ~ Sudarshan: Agreed on that. 
I think right now Weaviate schemas don't even allow deletion of certain properties (you can only add new ones), and it's been a struggle for us when we decide to change a property name or add a new property. 
Not sure what the best way to handle this would be

[2023-11-11, 14:17:18] ~ Palash: Noob question
I tried them using an account which didn't have chat gpt plus

These don't work with that account

If chat gpt plus is a must to use these, then these GPTs won't spread widely

Thoughts?
[2023-11-11, 14:18:28] Anil Chandra Naidu Matcha: They need a lot of compute to run, even with the access being limited to plus the responses are quite slow and errors many times
[2023-11-11, 14:19:03] Sreechand Tavva: For now, its accessible between accounts that have gpt plus, they plan to launch the GPT store early next week, after which any user can access it.

The GPT creator will get to monetize it as well

[2023-11-11, 15:11:46] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Hi All

Is anyone seeing issues in the new gpt-4-1106-preview model when used via langchain ?

Seems a lot of the outputs returned tend to be empty which leads me to believe that the model is not completely supported via langchain yet. Is anyone else facing similar problems ?
[2023-11-11, 15:16:21] ~ Dimos Anagnostopoulos: I guess we can create a whole series of photos like comics from text , where you narrate the story through pictures, but you have to make sure the model creates the same looking character /protagonist as the story unfolds
[2023-11-11, 15:39:48] C Chaitanya: So. Many. GPTs.
I have actually tried some of them. Almost all of them have a problem where they are not really useful beyond the first couple of prompts. Not something which you can go back again and again. I might have missed some, so if someone has a GPT which they think works well enough to bookmark, please let me know.
I am getting an "Alexa Skills" vibe. When they were launched(even with a no code editor), they were told as the best thing after iPhone marketplace. Skills did not have a killer app(B2C). I think GPTs have a similar problem so far.

[2023-11-12, 09:14:40] Hasan Tech Art: The skill set for the 21st century which is agreed upon by experts in education is - 
Critical thinking
Communication 
Collaboration
Creativity 

We can safely add AI now both as a learning tool and a collaborator in the mix. The education system will need a complete overhaul. Also rethinking of the interfaces going forward will change how we use computers. The UI we have today where text, excel sheet, image, audio and video are distinct objects trapped within there own space. This needs to be changed as the interface become fluid and context aware. Changing from one representation and interaction to another based on the context. This will need a new type of thinking about mediums and how we don’t have to choose and stick to a single one.

[2023-11-12, 11:30:07] Akash Tandon: Interesting poll results.

Everyone who mentioned writing their own code - did you try either of the frameworks and then switched or did you not go down that road at all?

In our case, we haven't even tried using a framework in production. I'm curious about everyone's experience.
[2023-11-12, 11:30:37] ~ Palash: Not tried
[2023-11-12, 11:33:03] Nirant K: A secondary point is selection bias: Too many _active_ folks in this group have been doing RAG from a time when both frameworks were either not around or not mature enough to be tried. That is why they relate to the _applied_ nature of challenges discussed here
[2023-11-12, 11:36:37] Akash Tandon: Makes sense.
Do you believe that the frameworks, if any, are mature for using in production for someone building a use case from scratch?

For more context, we didn't have a proper RAG use case earlier (primarily text mining, summarisation) but are planning to put one in production soon (retrieval, reranking).

That's why the question as well.
[2023-11-12, 11:42:57] Shan: We can’t and don’t want to send all our prompts and responses to some startup in the cloud (I can fight for azure and gcp and aws but not further). On-Prem solutions are few and the work needed is as good as rolling your own solution anyways.
[2023-11-12, 11:47:50] Akash Tandon: > some startup in the cloud

Didn't get this. You can work with the frameworks being discussed on your cloud. They're just abstraction layers for your code. 

I don't think we're talking about infrastructure unless I misunderstood the premise.
[2023-11-12, 13:24:56] ~ Khauneesh: Same point the frameworks especially llamaindex or langchain were not very mature at the time and we wanted to pilot quickly although we used langchain to create llm object as it takes care of retries and time outs, but chunking and ingestion pipeline from raw data and information retrieval and final output were all self coded, 

Given that these frameworks have matured a lot now with more sophisticated techniques especially on information retrieval side we are looking again into them
[2023-11-12, 14:01:27] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: Exact same here.
[2023-11-12, 14:20:14] Prashant Singh JarApp: this is a good start
[2023-11-12, 14:36:50] ~ Pramod: I have a usecase where I want to provide a URL like langchain documentation to ChatGPT/Claude, and I want to ask questions based on the documentation to it (I want the tool to build the knowledge recursively based on the URL given the usecase) and then ask question

I see ChatGPT and Claude support the knowledge base via offline documents now (even the GPTs)

Is there an easier way to get this done?
[2023-11-12, 14:45:38] ~ Kifilshah: Have you tried cursor? It lets you index links and use it in queries
[2023-11-12, 14:46:51] ~ Pramod: I use cursor but it index only the given link, I’m looking for something which can index the documentation recursively so I can ask questions based on the documentation

On the other hand, I have seen a lot of startups formed after OpenAI announcements.
[2023-11-13, 07:27:08] Nitin Umass Amherst Walmart Labs: In the case of startups, birth is instant but death is slow, in the sense that they will not be able to compete or make money and perish eventually. It's not like VCs instantly withdraw their funding. The startups will pivot their mission statement or product idea a bit to still be novel or work towards the solution in a different approach

[2023-11-13, 13:14:33] Nirant K: Here are some notes:

1. This is a Tamil version of the previous Chinese Alpaca work. Not the ColossalAI which is philosophically and implementation wise different (??)
2. Dataset: Google translation of the Alpaca + OpenOrca, so I'd expect decent instruction performance. Pretraining is 12G dataset, not too large. Seems like we can do this for 20 more languages for a couple of 100 dollars?
3. Evaluation: Uses GPT4 for eval, which leaves more room for error, since we know GPT4 itself is terrible at reasoning eval in Tamil. I'd have loved an "TamilLLM eval set"  release with this. Chinese got this right with their C-Eval.
[2023-11-13, 13:15:24] Nirant K: cc @917025755203 if I remember correctly, but I might be wrong you'd looked at ColossalAI approach more closely than me, do you think this approach is more token/sample efficient or the other one?
[2023-11-13, 13:17:22] Nirant K: What I like most about this approach is that this disproves a personal blocker I had: I need to be able to read/speak the language I do NLP in. You only need to know Mandarin 🇨🇳
[2023-11-13, 13:19:43] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Recently had conversation with Anand Kannappan, from PatronusAI, they are also working on Eval, domain specific not language specific though, but the eval space is heating up and seems very important going forward. 

He is a good add to this group, if anyone has his number and if he wants to join the community.
[2023-11-13, 13:33:51] Shahul Kaggle Kernel GM: Both seems very similar to me. The paper lacks details such as total number of pre-training tokens, compute used, etc and loss charts so it's hard to say anything. Regarding finetuning stage: datasets like open-orca, alpaca is best to use after rigorous data cleaning and eval data decontamination - to make it more sample efficient and avoid overfitting.

[2023-11-13, 16:25:09] Nirant K: Businesses using community to do support, is very different from this. Speed is not a goal for us. We’re not saving cost, we want people to have the best chance at the best answer.
[2023-11-13, 16:26:01] Nirant K: Given that we’ve low search usage on the web export too, not sure if a bot would be great experience either
[2023-11-13, 16:32:40] Nirant K: This is very different intent, than say what I'd have if I was running community for Qdrant or a course (example from Kartik's thread) — there, all queries cost you time, are fairly repetitive, have a single authority source (the company) and somewhat stable over time. 

As a very off tangent: I do think for a few categories of knowledge/info products, support/community should be seen as a pre-sales touchpoint e.g. Zappos' way and not after-sales cost centre

[2023-11-14, 14:28:21] Lucifer 😎: A quick question on pre-training the bert model
When it was being pre-trained on 2 tasks parallelly ( MLM and NSP ), wasn't there a mismatch in how it was being trained ?
In MLM, the tokens were masked ( 15% of the time ), and during NSP, the model tends to figure out if SentB comes after SentA
Won't there be an issue in model predicting some ( Masked Token ) as it's also being trained parallelly on the other tasks ? ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-14, 14:57:13] Nirant K: You might be interested in the Jay Allamar or Peter Aibeel lectures on multi task training. tl;dr is with large data, conflicts get resolved and models learn whatever is underlying anyway. Instruction Finetuning is what we call this today.

[2023-11-14, 16:40:30] Ajey Gore: If you are okay with GPTS then just use OpenAI GPTs
[2023-11-14, 16:40:39] Nirant K: If you intend to use a retrieval system e.g. vector search, something more complex — perhaps Llama Index is the best one today. If you want something for personal use which you can upload and forget, the GPTs system is best suited for speed
[2023-11-14, 16:41:07] ~ Abhishek Shivkumar: LlamaIndex + OpenAI GPT3.5 API.

[2023-11-14, 17:37:54] Lucifer 😎: Currently, everytime a client uploads a document (invoice, pdf, discharge summary, unstructured doc) on our frontend platform, we split and chunk those and upload to pinecone
And then we provide the client to access any info they want ( small RAG in place )


Issue is - we don't want to upload docs everytime a client come up with a new diff document. 
Is there any better alternative to this ?

I want 
- conversation memory to be included + ( no upload docs to pinecone every now and then ) + Context of the doc should be provided to LLM for answering ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-14, 17:42:05] Lucifer 😎: Na, I mean
I want the client to access / extract any Kv pairs they want from the doc

For that, I cannot do incontext promoting ( as the docs range from 30-100 pages ) and won't fit in my Context length

[2023-11-14, 19:01:55] Bargava: Problem:

Reviewing Pull Requests take time. 

- Our velocity of feature development is high. 
- It makes our engineering leads/architects a limiting factor. 
- It is not uncommon for priorities to change and a newly built feature gets deployed before something that's still stuck in PR review. 
- Many times, the developer has to go and update some of the code before resubmitting it for PR again because of this. 

Need:
Our CTO wants to expedite reviewing PRs and release cycle

Where we are right now:
My team has built a preliminary LLM-based review that looks for common issues based on previous PR issues/feedback. For now, only very common issues get flagged (unused variables, anti-patterns, naming style etc... none of which really requires LLM). 

Checking if anyone else has built a solution for this? Any good practices to follow here?

[2023-11-15, 08:45:22] Paras Chopra Wingify: Does anyone have full text of this article: https://newsletter.pragmaticengineer.com/p/inside-openai-how-does-chatgpt-ship
[2023-11-15, 08:45:24] Paras Chopra Wingify: Curious about day to day habits they refer
[2023-11-15, 08:48:39] Atik Shaikh: +1
[2023-11-15, 08:49:15] Nirant K: @919663177655 you worked with Gergey, right? Have a sub to his substack?
[2023-11-15, 08:50:44] Paras Chopra Wingify: On a side note, HTTP protocol must incorporate micro transactions 

I would have gladly paid money for this specific article without requiring whole sign up 10 dollars / month thing
[2023-11-15, 08:56:19] Vignesh Baskaran: DMing
[2023-11-15, 08:57:35] Sumanth Raghavendra: Not possible to build up a meaningful business on micro transactions - the math just doesn't add up
[2023-11-15, 08:58:53] Vignesh Baskaran: I know the founder. Can connect you with him if needed
[2023-11-15, 09:01:15] Paras Chopra Wingify: I meant the HTTP committee should add in the protocol. I know it’s hard but I think there have been initiatives
[2023-11-15, 09:03:50] Sumanth Raghavendra: The technology is readily available, the unit economics not so much
[2023-11-15, 09:12:04] Shan: IIRC Roberta does away with NSP and performs significantly better than BERT
[2023-11-15, 09:22:14] Sudhanshu Heda Entrepreneur First: https://www.reddit.com/r/LocalLLaMA/comments/17vcr9d/llm_comparisontest_2x_34b_yi_dolphin_nous/
[2023-11-15, 09:22:27] Sudhanshu Heda Entrepreneur First: GPT 4 comparable model in open source
[2023-11-15, 09:24:59] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Also, XLM-RoBERTa (XLM-R) is a pre-trained multilingual model that outperforms multiligual BERT. Reason: XLM-R was trained using a lot more data and on 100+ languages.
[2023-11-15, 09:28:22] Nirant K: Trivia: Where does the "X" in XLM come from?

Cross-linguality and multi-linguality used to have slightly different meaning back in the day, we use the phrasing "multi-language" to mean both today. Cross meant that you had all languages embedded in same space or models, which meant translation was richer and emergent translation properties e.g. a numerical intermediate between languages was first seen. This was the predecessor to what we today take as normal: You can just map meaning from one language to another and it's just "meaning" or whatever meanings means to you.

Sorry all puns were intentional, I'm not a coward
[2023-11-15, 09:34:37] Shan: Unless. UPI
[2023-11-15, 09:35:47] Nirant K: The no free lunch theorem states that UPI is not free either, the costs are just borne by a different entity i.e. the taxpayer initially, and then the consortium "NPCI"
[2023-11-15, 09:37:54] Shan: Yes but the business model is straightforward. If NPCI charges 20% of users  50 per year or some such small amount which they’ll be happy to pay it’s all good. (I know I don’t mind paying 50/yr as a reference price point )

[2023-11-15, 10:00:55] Nirant K: Sad. No AGI?
[2023-11-15, 10:01:36] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I may have a contrarian opinion but UPI (free or even subsidized) is not good for India on a longer run. Any socialist interference by Govt seems temporary but then it never goes away
[2023-11-15, 10:02:01] Nilesh Transcend: Or may be there's just a sweet spot for AGI.
[2023-11-15, 10:04:01] Nirant K: It's okay. US subsidises agriculture for it's farmers more than India's budget in most years. Socialism doesn't hurt as much in isolation.
[2023-11-15, 10:05:47] Shan: Tch tch. Just change the definition of AGI.

[2023-11-15, 10:39:46] Lucifer 😎: Anyone using any orchestration and versioning tool for LLMs?

Which is the best and cheap ones ?
[2023-11-15, 10:40:05] Nirant K: Python is practically free
[2023-11-15, 10:41:05] Lucifer 😎: Ah, Yes. 
But I wanted something concrete

I was going through Metaflow and Flyte, couldn't decide which is better. 
Hence atm, hokding onto mlfow
[2023-11-15, 10:41:46] Nirant K: Perhaps a better question would be to ask if there are folks who use Metaflow and Flyte then?
[2023-11-15, 10:42:47] Lucifer 😎: Yes, my bad.
[2023-11-15, 10:52:59] ~ Sachin Kalsi: good to know this. but how are you handling context length here?
[2023-11-15, 11:00:16] ~ Shanthi Vardhan: We are using Flyte for our data ingestion pipeline haven’t tried Metaflow
[2023-11-15, 11:07:03] ~ Harsh Goel: I want to maintain context for chatgpt using langchain over different API calls for different users respectively.
What i read is we need to have the memory stored, so what’s the best way to store it?

Got something around
ConversationBufferMemory(memory_key="chat_history")

but since there can be 1000s keys for memory, what’s the best method to store it and delete when not needed?
[2023-11-15, 11:09:30] Paras Chopra Wingify: The net benefit for the taxpayer is probably positive, so a worthy investment 

(Like all externalities like roads)
[2023-11-15, 11:19:24] ~ Mohammed: Does somebody have a comparison of different vector databases based on cost, speed, usability and other parameters ?
[2023-11-15, 11:19:59] ~ Harsh Goel: Maybe some better and cheaper alternatives to https://www.pinecone.io/
[2023-11-15, 11:25:42] Nirant K: ann-benchmarks.com is the most trusted performance benchmark in terms of scale. Most of them have a dedicated HNSW index, so between 1m and 10m vectors range — there is no latency difference, though memory and hence, cost and throughput varies quite a bit. Below 500K vectors, you can use something like pgvector.

Most efficient in terms of memory usage are Qdrant, Vespa at the moment. Weaviate comes second at 30x higher memory usage.

Disclosure: I work for Qdrant, so I should mention that X/Twitter and a certain AI company who had a Dev Day use Qdrant because it's both performant and easy to use
[2023-11-15, 11:28:10] Atik Shaikh: Why not saying OpenAI directly 😂
[2023-11-15, 11:30:07] ~ Shipra: Could you please DM me as well? Thanks 🙏🏽
[2023-11-15, 11:30:33] Vamshi: I’m getting “this request is beyond the capabilities of this platform” from GPT4 for ridiculously simple requests, since dev day.

Perhaps this explains it. It also helps me partly understand a lot of the overall UX strategy they use, perhaps someone better informed can shed additional light on this.

GPT4 constantly appears to game the user to get away with the minimal viable response.

At times this feels tiring, like you’re dealing with an expert who’s being pricey, literally.

[2023-11-15, 13:24:56] C Chaitanya: Was discussing with Swecha, the FSMI division of Hyderabad. We wanted to see if the FSMI could help in creating open source datasets. So inspired by Tiny Stories I suggested, why don't we create Chandamama Kathalu(stories) dataset. So like once upon a time creates an english story, Anaganaga oka roju should create a Telugu story. So first attempt at this will happen tomorrow. Calling it a datathon. More than 50 engineering colleges are participating. We have a basic data collection platform coded. Taking old pdfs of Chandamama stories->OCR->Fixing OCR text by students. If anyone has done such data collection exercises, please let me know of any gotchas we have to be careful about etc.
[2023-11-15, 13:25:44] Nirant K: cc @918123359302 would you happen to know folks who can help by any chance?
[2023-11-15, 13:37:55] C Chaitanya: This is anyway just the start. I think lots of learnings will come from the exercise. The idea is that India might be GPU poor, but we are people rich. Real neural networks/brains can be put to task :)
For this experiment, the open source dataset created should help in OCR for Telugu, LLM for Telugu. We initially thought of getting the stories also recorded. But that would have been too much for now.

[2023-11-15, 13:43:40] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: This is a great initiative. Data set creation is one of the most boring and tedious task, but going forward it is also going to be a strength.
[2023-11-15, 13:45:11] ~ Sudarshan: Really cool stuff!
[2023-11-15, 13:45:27] C Chaitanya: Exactly. Back in 2005 when I was an Assistant Professor we had done a similar "datathon" to translate Ubuntu into Telugu. If I remeber correctly students translated some 50,000 properties in a day and that helped in getting a Telugu OS.
[2023-11-15, 13:48:37] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: We have been doing it for Agri. However, I'm not thinking about releasing the dataset but will do it with the model once trained.
[2023-11-15, 13:50:18] ~ Sumit: What do you guys think about using pgvector vs the specific vector database solutions? I wanna go with pgvector and it seems like with the recent HNSW plugin it's as fast as the competitors. But I couldn't find solid benchmarks or a list of pros and cons.
[2023-11-15, 13:51:14] Paras Chopra Wingify: Another option is postgresml
[2023-11-15, 13:52:18] C Chaitanya: My long term goal is to help Swecha create this platform which can churn out high quality datasets using students and their time. But most importantly, these datasets will be open source as this is being done by FSMI.
In 2005, the fight was with proprietary OS. Open source fought well and won in some places(servers etc). Now the fight is with proprietary AI :).
[2023-11-15, 13:54:38] ~ Ashok: Check https://milvus.io
[2023-11-15, 13:59:41] Nirant K: Love pgvector if you're doing small deployments or early in the lifecycle. It's faster to deploy, but you'd pay for it in memory costs after you hit 500K or so embeds. But till then, it's probably the best solution.
[2023-11-15, 14:02:02] ~ Sumit: Interesting. In that case might be best to keep it abstracted away in the app logic for easier swap-out in the future. The primary thing that attracts me towards pgvector is having a single database for everything.

[2023-11-15, 14:53:53] Nirant K: I hear this is a good opportunity to write a new vector db 😅
[2023-11-15, 14:56:05] Dev Aggarwal: np.save, np.load, np.dot == 💓

[2023-11-15, 22:18:10] Saurabh Karn Nyai: I am trying decipher a mystery. So there’s a retriever pipeline that has around 300 PDFs related to Laws. Now because MTEB we thought of comparing both ada and BAAI models so see which embedding model out of the box work better. 

Contrary to our expectations, ada significantly out performed baai/bge model. 

My questions are:
1) Has someone else also observed this?
2) what could we be doing wrong?
3) other than relaxing K value , what else can be done? (Assuming fine tuning is the way)
[2023-11-15, 22:43:22] ~ Sudarshan: Have observed the same on some internal benchmarks — I suspect that BAAI 's embeddings have atleast been in part trained on parts of the MTEB test set

[2023-11-15, 23:18:15] C Chaitanya: Yes. That's also part of the plan. But for now, we are looking at the data collection and cleaning process only. Since this data will come from OCR and then be corrected by humans, we will be storing that data also and then see how we can use LLMs to help improve the OCR process.

[2023-11-16, 00:06:07] Ruchir GenAI Security: In most such cases the actual fact is they might have already been doing it, some internal lawyer found out and got them to make it explicit to avoid future issues. The type of data they have mentioned in the new policy seems to indicate another such case.. this is just my hunch not based on any facts
[2023-11-16, 00:07:32] Arko C | xylem.ai: How do you see this as an ex-CISO? Do you feel enterprises will start coming up with SOPs and checklists for any AI tool or experiment internally?
[2023-11-16, 00:08:17] Arko C | xylem.ai: I mean we all knew that they were using the data, no matter how much management sugarcoating they do to their statements
[2023-11-16, 00:10:14] Ruchir GenAI Security: I think this is still just for the regular ChatGPT not for enterprise.. but I am a strong believer in the fact that most enterprises building a feature using LLMs that interacts with their data will host a model in their infra even if it comes at certain costs (like maybe not the best model). It’s just too big a risk otherwise
[2023-11-16, 00:12:41] Arko C | xylem.ai: I have been seeing a similar apprehension. Spoken to more an more people after dev day. There’s just no trust in whatever they say. They are all deliberating use cases but once they do, they seem to tilt more towards in house models.

Spoke to some folks at Hugging Face as well. They see exactly similar trends.
[2023-11-16, 00:50:52] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: this is needed for indemnity. they already make a commitment not to use ur data to train. 
however, theoretically their load balancer can be hacked and all queries logged. this is needed for GDPR indemnification. openai is saying it is not responsible for your private data if u send it
[2023-11-16, 00:53:57] Arko C | xylem.ai: Ya but there’s less of “might” and more of explicit mention of the fact that they do collect it.

I totally understand how it helps them with tough regions like EU/UK. If something happens, then user’s fault as it’s explicitly mentioned.

However, this one line is just gonna be a massive deterrent towards a better notion around GPT for enterprises. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-16, 00:54:42] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: same issue for enterprises. theres no difference - if u run a private model and expose it to ur users, u will have to issue the SAME declaration. it is no better.
[2023-11-16, 00:54:56] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: unless u want to accept that you are responsible for their data
[2023-11-16, 00:58:29] Arko C | xylem.ai: that makes sense, however, then you can argue that its in-house or on my restricted cloud + I own the model, so not something that bothers me.


But what you say seems to be something all B2C or B2B2C company on the LLM application layer will have to look into

No matter which model you use
[2023-11-16, 04:13:11] Akshat Khare: What is a stable container you guys are using to run the new gen ai repos on? I tried https://github.com/THUDM/CogVLM on jarvislabs pytorch but getting version issues. is there some ngc container which is ready and works good for you?

[2023-11-16, 05:30:20] ~ Kaustubh: Do you know if custom GPTs use RAG in the backend or they directly feed the document as context?
[2023-11-16, 05:31:39] ~ Kaustubh: I tried using a CSV file and a text file. The CSV file is invoked the code interpreter but the text file didn't. And the gpt worked well with text file as input.

https://www.rungalileo.io/hallucinationindex
[2023-11-16, 10:46:10] Paras Chopra Wingify: Has no commercial offering come up that beats gpt3.5 on both cost and quality ?
[2023-11-16, 10:50:54] Nirant K: I doubt that it's even possible "in general"

For task specific things, most OSS does better perf already. Cost is still higher, barring one offs like Anyscale's Llama $1 for 1M tokens offer
[2023-11-16, 10:56:43] Arko C | xylem.ai: It’s explicitly mentioned for chatGPT only at the moment

Won’t be surprised if the API has similar issues that’s waiting for a lawyer to point it out for their GDPR and other safeguards.
[2023-11-16, 10:57:54] ~ Amit Sharma: their ToS explicitly says otherwise although nothing can be ruled out 😀
[2023-11-16, 10:59:30] Arko C | xylem.ai: Yes I know. The change was Subtly made on the ChatGPT ToS. Hoping that it’s not an issue with the APIs.

[2023-11-16, 16:23:00] Kartikeya Bharadwaj: it’s also like a GitHub co-pilot for music producers, right off the bat. i have a bunch of friends who produce music for tv commercials/products etc. rn they hum ideas, listen to their humming 10-15 times and then play it on a keyboard/ableton etc.

[2023-11-16, 16:53:53] Arko C | xylem.ai: You can license out keys that expire as per the contract. On the weights front, the customer owns the model so that is not something we look at, but you add multiple layers of encryption over the pipelines and then the docker images get their license keys that expire as per your contract.

[2023-11-16, 22:33:27] Nirant K: There are two different axes in which we assess emerging tech:

Direction: Where is this headed? — This is what engineers and investors care about. We want to predict the feature, and either invest time or capital in it
Magnitude: How good is it today? — This is what you pointed out, lot of this is brittle _today_

Now, if you were to look at how fast is something is improving, that's the change in magnitude

We can see from the improved robustness of both function calling and JSONSchema, that OpenAI is really good at learning & shipping fast
[2023-11-16, 22:33:41] Ravi Theja: should have added the cost of avg time spent by human to debug gpt3 code as well.
[2023-11-16, 22:34:13] Pratyush Choudhury: People are using tools to measure developer productivity (using some metrics like DORA etc), mapping it to $$s spent on R&D & then doing comparisons w/ AI tokens from an ROI perspective

Still don’t have my own conviction on if this is short/medium term vs long-term but this comparison will become more common inside board rooms & that would indicate a few interesting downstream conversations

One of them is probably: “Service as a Software” - a new kind of SaaS, another one of them is what I am calling Ephemeral software, lightweight software, written for single use & then discarded 

And another is what @917737887058 & I have debated long about: Software Devs’ workflows looking like code verification & coordination vs code creation & coordination

[2023-11-17, 00:13:05] ~ Sumit: In the context of Ragas, what's the difference between "ground truths" and answers? I'm generating a dataset to evaluate a chatbot, how should I write the ground truths?

It's mentioned that for a single question there can be multiple ground truths, so I'm guessing ground truths are just "facts", not the answer. The answer will use those ground truths and phrase it in a specific way, but the ground truths are just singular facts.

Do I have the right idea? Can anyone give some examples maybe?

This is amazing and also scary for startups trying to host OSS models.
[2023-11-17, 06:31:37] Dev Aggarwal: I think its not that simple. This is not shared inference and instead a managed instance that you have to pay for to run
[2023-11-17, 06:34:45] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Ohh damn. Then, it’s expensive if one doesn’t have enough load, for individual non-MLOps startups. But you can also think of many startups who can just build UI on top of some instance deployments, and roll out products overnight.

[2023-11-17, 08:35:06] ~ Parth: they reduce the setup time basically..Vertex has Gen AI App builder and studio which basically lets you also do something like Assistant API (with and without coding explicitly) - deploy custom fine tuned model straightaway on your gcp instances and also provides the integration code (in python/js)

[2023-11-17, 08:37:42] ~ Parth: *speaking more about gcp because i just wrapped up a hackathon with them in october exploring entire vertex ai and gen ai app builder ecosystem and some of their models in closed beta like MedPaLM 2 and bison 32k. The only folks lagging behind in the gen ai consumer cloud wars right now I would say is AWS with their slower bedrock ecosystem rollout.

[2023-11-17, 10:29:46] ~ Parth: You'll still need to run benchmark on your end, I don't think they have eval like system in place, has to be custom built as a pipeline
[2023-11-17, 10:30:00] Nirant K: Meta has done a commendable job in stewarding 2 large projects from their ownership to the wider ecosystem: PyTorch & React

It takes a lot of discipline to give away control
[2023-11-17, 10:33:03] ~ Parth: i honestly feel the gusto with which tensorflow began before pytorch, it just fizzled out in last couple of years and pytorch is now insanely stable and has a great active community

[2023-11-17, 10:35:30] Nirant K: I've used PyTorch since it's 0.4 release. Tensorflow began strong with a marketing push, but the design was soon all over the place. This is partially because Googlers don't use the open TF, but their own internal one — which is obviously better maintained.

Soon it became easier to take the pytorch code from papers and modify it to your data. But definitely has a better OS community and very helpful

[2023-11-17, 13:25:38] Dhawal Jain Generative AI Group: Please share any information that you find on this with me also, very curious to dig deeper into Pi.
[2023-11-17, 13:27:18] Paras Chopra Wingify: We found it’s easy to get close to this via prompting 

Check out custom gpt https://chat.openai.com/g/g-1Ps6gPVnr

In fact, in blind tests, people preferred responses from Nintee (based on prompting chatgpt) vs Pi

So, the difference is probably not very deep at the moment
[2023-11-17, 13:27:54] Anuj Gupta DLBLR Meetups: unfortunately found nothing so far.
[2023-11-17, 13:29:14] Paras Chopra Wingify: They’re likely just doing a slightly different RLHF, plus likely a state machine to detect if user is bored and wants to move to another topic
[2023-11-17, 13:29:19] Paras Chopra Wingify: Replicating this isn’t hard
[2023-11-17, 13:29:47] Paras Chopra Wingify: just lots of compute for training foundational models + post processing responses + some meta level model
[2023-11-17, 13:30:00] Anuj Gupta DLBLR Meetups: No ideas about Nintee but with Pi I have spent over 50 hrs - its been class apart
[2023-11-17, 13:30:14] Dhawal Jain Generative AI Group: Yeah same experience with prompting @919868221372, but there are some characterstics like acknowledging by repeting, length of response etc that we are unable to make chatgpt understand fully through prompts. Somehow Pi is excellent with those.
[2023-11-17, 13:30:19] Anuj Gupta DLBLR Meetups: then why others are not able to replicate?
[2023-11-17, 13:30:49] Anuj Gupta DLBLR Meetups: I have done lot of stress test of Pi - its been spot on
[2023-11-17, 13:30:54] Dhawal Jain Generative AI Group: Why have they raised do much money in the first place?
[2023-11-17, 13:31:11] Anuj Gupta DLBLR Meetups: There is definitely more than what meets the eyes
[2023-11-17, 13:32:25] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Prompting + Curated Dataset. You can see how Harmes is scoring well on conversations with just a better dataset.
[2023-11-17, 13:32:31] Paras Chopra Wingify: the founders are world class
[2023-11-17, 13:33:22] Paras Chopra Wingify: i doubt they have fundamentally new architecture or insights

they're simply attacking a different problem: chatgpt is informational, pi is emotional support
[2023-11-17, 13:34:11] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Could you tell us what sort of use cases you have found Pi this appealing for ?

Just curious to know
[2023-11-17, 13:34:44] Abhishek Mishra: Did you try to get anything useful out of it?

If you push it even slightly to do anything meaningful. Or follow instructions other than spam emojis or offer generic advice it fails.
[2023-11-17, 13:34:55] Paras Chopra Wingify: im suggesting, try chatting with the customgpt i shared above, similar (and obviously not exactly same) responses
[2023-11-17, 13:35:51] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I would claim that if you spend a few million for hand curating 100K-250K instructions, and fine-tuning LlaMa2, you can achieve a very similar performance to Pi. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-17, 13:40:31] Dhawal Jain Generative AI Group: tried, seems like running into similar constraints. Pi is not having issues of longer responses etc. It's impossible to control the problems I mentioned: acknowledging by repetition and minimum necessary length.
[2023-11-17, 14:06:23] Anubhav mishra Zupay: @19377081307 I don't think so , why do feel that way?
[2023-11-17, 14:08:27] Anubhav mishra Zupay: There is some crazy personalization algo they use which Mustafa Suleyman never talks about. 

Maybe for the text generation it can be good, but pi has insane personalization
[2023-11-17, 14:10:10] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Every one training on almost architecture. Look at what Yi is doing. There are no secret ingredients except the Data and Compute.

[2023-11-17, 14:19:15] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Inflection is more inclined towards creating Interactive AI, There is a very good article by Mustafa in MIT tech. And no one has any idea about how and what they are doing with the base LLMs pretty secretive

[2023-11-17, 15:30:37] ~ Sourabh: General business strategy question: 

What are your thoughts on the ‘Create your own GPT’ strategy as whole? Do y’all think it’s a good approach by OpenAI? I think it’s not going to stick. 

The whole idea why ChatGPT became so popular (IMO) is because of its ability to answer wide range of questions from users on anything. 

These custom GPTs create restraints. For solving specific problem areas like what the custom GPTs are doing, I don’t think a Q&A interface is intuitive that way vanilla GPT is. Curious to know what y’all think. 

It’s also counterintuitive to me that on one hand, they consolidated all the plugins for GPT-4 for users, and on other hand come up with custom GPTs.
[2023-11-17, 15:38:34] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: “Workflows” are narrow.

Maybe they smartly first built a horizontal platform and now narrow niche workflows are being built on it?
[2023-11-17, 15:49:11] Bharat Kumar Ramesh Hashmal Web3: Interesting question. A platformic approach is generally a great idea for scaling. Salesforce saw great success with AppExchange, Fb initially with games, Apple ofcourse with appstore

Mostly because the custom GPTs adds a layer of abstraction, obviating the need for every user to train it for a specific purpose. That being said, here are two things I suspect will happen

1. They'll eventually allow creators to monetize these GPTs, creating an economic incentive to make high quality value adding GPTs

2. They'll also realize that a text interface isn't sufficient, thereby adding a layer of UI

At this point, they would have basically created an AI version of an Appstore, which instead of having OS lock-in, has fundamental model lock-in
[2023-11-17, 15:51:38] Nirant K: If you see it as a clever way to collect high quality prompts and instruction data for tool use — this is genius. If you see it as a way to increase revenue this quarter or year, this can be terrible.

So say, you were willing to make a 10-20 year investment on data, this is excellent. If not, all this is weird distraction
[2023-11-17, 16:07:21] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I think gpts are an evolution of plugins. Plugins had an unintuitive interface and too much bureaucracy getting started.
[2023-11-17, 16:07:33] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Plugins will eventually be replaced soon
[2023-11-17, 16:12:00] ~ Mayank Gupta: They already have been I thought. Exactly by GPTs
[2023-11-17, 16:12:35] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: They still are there.
[2023-11-17, 16:23:22] Shan: The business strategy is similar to plugins. They launched plugins (does anyone remember those lol) it didn’t work and so no big deal. They’ve launched GPTs and if they don’t work no big deal.

[2023-11-17, 16:23:58] ~ Mayank Gupta: Oh ok. Then agreed that it's the planned replacement
[2023-11-17, 16:26:19] Varshul Dubverse: True. Reversible decisions. Especially at scale. At worst they end up collecting more data and move towards a GPT store anyway.

It’s amusing how we think it’s some massive game theory at play when it’s just startup-execution from their end.
[2023-11-17, 16:31:11] ~ Sourabh: Sure, it’s usually good to ship fast and check out what sticks, but I’m struggling to see the direction. 

Do you want to eventually create an awesome ‘can-do-anything’ AI (GPT-4 with auto-plugins) or many small AI bots that do specific things well (Custom GPTs). Both approaches are very different in their vision of the future
[2023-11-17, 16:40:38] ~ Sourabh: Lot of interesting thoughts on this by Ben Evans also:

[2023-11-17, 16:42:10] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Can an Apple M2 Ultra machine be used for practical fine tuning workloads
[2023-11-17, 16:42:17] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: It has 192 GB of unified memory
[2023-11-17, 16:51:42] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Does anyone also think it might be possible that the Copilot that Microsoft has launched is going to be doing automation of browser tasks in future with agents ? Like what induced AI does.
[2023-11-17, 16:54:35] ~ Yash Khivasara: I got some credits from OpenAI however there is a rate limit issue I am getting. I want to increase the rpm 

Anyone has found any work around or tried to reach out to OpenAI and they helped to increase rpm while you are still using credits?

[2023-11-18, 00:32:06] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: for those who don’t know KQL: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/data-explorer/kusto/query/

basically a different form of SQL
[2023-11-18, 00:36:26] ~ whyshock: I just ask it to output the result in query that is SnowflakeDB Compliant 

For our snowflakeDB , I think just changing this might help for your case 

Just add in the the usual your an expert , and honest etc etc in the prompts
[2023-11-18, 00:55:28] Arko C | xylem.ai: Feed the schema as part of the system prompt or context and ask it to directly give the query
[2023-11-18, 00:56:27] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: okayyy understood
[2023-11-18, 00:57:22] Arko C | xylem.ai: If doesn’t work, try feeding some more info as part of system prompt or context, explaining the schema and the parameters

I’ve stumbled on to it just now and it’s a whole repository and environment to train agents 

And this is dated back to Dec 2016!

https://github.com/openai/universe

Here’s an example 
Real-world browser tasks. 
-The agent takes an instruction, and performs a sequence of actions on a website. One such environment hands the agent details of a desired flight booking, and then requires it to manipulate a user interface to search for the flight. (We use cached recordings of these sites to avoid spamming them, or booking lots of real flights.)

[2023-11-19, 13:51:51] Nishant Apne-App GenAI Hackathon: The main novelty is that they create a consistent character given a text prompt.

What they do for this:
1. Given a text prompt: Generate a lot of images.
2. Cluster those images.
3. Choose the most dense cluster.
4. Try to get an identity out of it. (And train the model in 1 using this loss).


Then given these images, use standard Lora DB to generate more images of the same character like the standard methods.

Now, they have already done it. I strongly believe they will have to undo many decisions made by him and also make some constructive decisions that align with their goals. Later, they will call back Sam to gain drive the growth of the company and this time it will be in the direction that tey want.
[2023-11-19, 14:25:09] ~ Rohit: No reason for Sam to come back to drive the company in a direction he isn't interested in.

May I ask what’s the product and what functionality does the moderation layer add to it ?
[2023-11-19, 16:18:09] Digvijay GenAI Group: Ig because 3.5 inherently came guardrailed with such safety features ?

[2023-11-19, 16:23:22] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: They became more commercial minded later. Plus yes 3.5 was RLHF trained so it was better at following instructions. It wasn't an autocomplete model in a way like earlier

one of the most comprehensive articles I've read this weekend. Talks about how multi-agent systems and multi-Lora help AGI goals. He calls for single agents that can do a task very well and the accumulate them all in ensemble kind of way rather than being universal solver for all types.

[2023-11-20, 08:39:55] Vaibhav Pilani: Can't use it directly. You have to add your own intelligence layer to make it usable
[2023-11-20, 09:29:05] Nirant K: Since you've worked on this directly, have specific areas where it fails?

E.g. I've heard that it fails when there is double negation, sarcasm in English and even outright abuse in non-European languages
[2023-11-20, 09:42:16] Vaibhav Pilani: Think of it in 4 dimensions 
1. your own platform policy, (what to delete vs keep)
2. the categories  (violence, hate etc) , 
3. category_score (which moderation api gives) and 
4. language

You need to test and fine-tune it for all the above dimensions for your own particular use case and data

[2023-11-20, 10:43:47] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: Agents could still be using RAG under the hood. The idea presented in that blog talk about using agents specialized in various things to  collectively achieve some outcome.
[2023-11-20, 10:45:21] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: When RAG doesn't work, usually the answer lies between figuring out the retrieval strategy or fine tuning. The gorilla paper is interesting in that regard, I think they studied the performance of ICL vs fine tuning for making api calls based on documentation.

[2023-11-20, 10:54:13] Nirant K: OpenAI Board drama on Watercooler group please 
[2023-11-20, 11:18:36] Dia Thanki: I've heard of use cases whereby RAG is not used explicitly nor under the hood and agents are recalibrated with taxonomic structures for aggregation of contextual text especially when the text is not present in the searchable doc
[2023-11-20, 11:20:29] Nirant K: What does taxonomic structure mean here? Can you share an example? E.g. how'd the LLM interact with a memory? How is the memory (document store?) organized?
[2023-11-20, 11:24:38] Dia Thanki: For example, for standard Q&A, you can use RAG as long as long as the model is finetuned for a given domain - the prompt query will search the doc for answers which contain the text or similar text as an answer.

But, if you want to aggregate an answer abstractively whereby the text or similar text is not in the doc, you have to combine using a taxonomy and agents for optimum context. 

Does that make sense? RAG is limited is that context
[2023-11-20, 11:25:40] Dia Thanki: Taxonomy = domain specific vocabularies including synonyms, acronyms and relationships between words for context
[2023-11-20, 11:48:14] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: What you are describing is still in the realm of RAG imo ?
[2023-11-20, 11:48:52] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: The algorithm and technique for retrieval varies from doing plain vector search to looking up a knowledge graph to get better context for the query.
[2023-11-20, 11:50:06] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: But yeah if the generative model is fine-tuned for a given domain, even with less context the quality of generation would probably be better.
[2023-11-20, 11:50:38] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: I haven't seen any definitive studies on this yet, most of the discussion happens in the context of a specific task.

This is because of the tokenisation step, it doesn’t know what individual characters are well enough.

The FILCO method is introduced as a solution to improve the quality of context for generators in the paper. 

This involves identifying useful context through lexical and information-theoretic approaches and training models to filter contexts during tests.

Context Filtering Techniques
FILCO uses techniques like String Inclusion (STRINC), Lexical Overlap, and Conditional Cross-Mutual Information (CXMI) for context filtering.

[2023-11-21, 00:40:49] Dhruv Anand: What process do folks here follow to give a RAG system knowledge about a repo/library. Ideally we shouldn’t have to embed all the code and documentation. Is there a utility which deterministically extracts the key parts of the API and docs along with examples from the repo, and puts it in a separate folder structure? Something that’s proven to work with Assistants API/myGPTs

[2023-11-21, 12:13:59] Kaushik Bokka: I am curious to know on how has it changed from their perspective. do they expect the platform to understand more context now? and can be direct with the queries?
[2023-11-21, 12:15:36] ~ Apurva Bhatt: I saw it before that. Maybe they are gradually rolling out to users. For the non-programming type of content, it gives good results.
[2023-11-21, 12:15:40] Kaushik Bokka: Naa, their website. It’s a good for citation driven research. 

However, I feel people go to chatgpt when sources don’t really matter
[2023-11-21, 12:15:47] Ambika Computational Mama: hmm unsure, i think he mainly meant in context of your summarization context, like earlier you would have to go to the library/archive and request the search and the “summary” was actually done by the librarians/archivists for you
[2023-11-21, 12:15:55] Ambika Computational Mama: and then you could ask for the relevant documents
[2023-11-21, 12:16:22] Ambika Computational Mama: i should check - i havent used it so much

[2023-11-21, 14:43:48] Akash Tandon: Hello, I've read suggestions here around using a hybrid approach for search (bm25+vector).

Those who have used this in user facing apps, what did your stack look like?
[2023-11-21, 14:44:52] Dhruv Anand: Weaviate has this built in. You can configure the weight you want to give to each part via a param
[2023-11-21, 15:08:42] Akash Tandon: Have you deployed it in an app though? If yes, how's the experience been?
I am asking since our it's primarily the operational complexity that I want to reduce. We will use a reranker (Cohere) with separate keyword/semantic query results anyway so quality of in-built hybrid ranking is a nice-to-have.

I've also explored traditional search solutions like Typesense and Elastic. I have had my hands burnt with Elastic in the past and not sure how seriously they take vector search.
I would've been happy to use Typesense based on past experience but it doesn't support BM25 which results in sub-par keyword-based results.🤦‍♂️
[2023-11-21, 15:19:49] Ambika Computational Mama: @918764022384 👆you might have some responses for this?
‎[2023-11-21, 15:22:34] Dev Aggarwal: ‎image omitted
[2023-11-21, 15:22:40] Dev Aggarwal: The hard part with this approach is memory management, so only works if you have less rows
[2023-11-21, 15:26:20] Dev Aggarwal: I think elastic search does this well, because it gives exact knn [1] , BM25 [2], their superior elser encodings [3] and also rrf [4]

[2023-11-21, 20:47:00] ~ Aman Dalmia: Has anyone here benchmarked gpt4turbo vs gpt-4-0613 for your use case? When gpt-4-0613 came out, I had to make significant changes to the prompt to get an equal or higher level of performance compared to the version before. My preliminary benchmarking with gpt4turbo is giving the same performance for most of my data but degraded performance for a subset. Curious to know if others in the group are facing this too. Having to constantly update prompts upon each version update seems painful.
[2023-11-21, 21:27:26] Vrushank Vyas: Side question: How do you benchmark the outputs? Maintaining google sheet or something? With human evals/metadata to judge?
[2023-11-21, 21:31:26] ~ Aman Dalmia: Fortunately, our use case doesn't involve open ended outputs and there is a fixed correct answer. So, we can simply check the accuracy!
[2023-11-21, 21:37:46] Lucifer 😎: Kalm
[2023-11-21, 22:06:12] ~ Amit Sharma: Big unsolved problem. Its far easier to switch / deploy between models but hard to judge the improvement/drop in performance unless there is tight feedback loop & sufficient up/down votes on output. No benchmarks in most domains / tasks.

An analysis done on context length recall of the new Claude2.1 model. 

One theory I'm having is while its quite possible that at really large context lengths the recall reduces a lot, but does that mean if the context length is like say 8k a.l.a GPT-4 the context recall of these models is better than a 8k context length model.

It does seem on initial testing that GPT-4-turbo does do better at following instructions and recall than GPT-4 if context is kept at around the 8k length. But these models also require prompt changing because they follow instructions more literally than the previous ones

[2023-11-22, 10:18:02] Ravi Theja: Interesting. @919632834013 and his team made experiments using a reranker. Might give a comment on reranker usage in RAG.
[2023-11-22, 10:19:52] ~ Shiraz: Curious to know the results. Unfortunately there are no results out there that can be verified. I have experimented with orderid for example and it helps but contextual understanding is hard to correct with rerank. Please share experiment results if possible
[2023-11-22, 10:20:41] Ravi Theja: Is your experiment in RAG context or some other context?

[2023-11-22, 11:01:01] Sumod K Mohan: One thing that still surprises me about GPT/chatGPT is that, it sort of knows how to pick the right set of things and sort of merge them. Have not heard many people speak about this. Have seen Sanjeev Arora talk about this in Simons Talk and seen Ilya talk briefly in some interview. Faith and Fate paper sort of talks around this. Any pointers..
[2023-11-22, 11:01:23] Sumod K Mohan: *how to merge them smoothly (in a mathematic sense), if that make sense.
[2023-11-22, 11:02:20] Kartik Mandaville: Ease of use and ignorance. Cohere PM works with us on calls/email so exploring that now.

[2023-11-22, 13:53:56] Sumba: Depends on your task that you are using an LLM for 

These days researchers are going for almost a "vibe" based evaluation where they see how a model performs in its answer for set of prompts specific to their task

[2023-11-22, 17:38:52] Dhruv Anand: In the Assistants API, is it possible up scale up the number of functions available to the assitant, by putting their documentation in the files provided for retrieval?

Currently, the physical limit is 64, and all the function specs are passed in every time via the system message, but ideally the assistant should be able to do a vector search and choose to pass only the relevant functions’ specs for a particular user instruction.
[2023-11-22, 17:40:51] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: It is. You could do via langchain as well (they have the documentation for that). Gorilla llm is also based on this.
Store your function definition in vector store, call the vector store with a definition llm is looking for
[2023-11-22, 17:41:48] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: But since the actual function is now not in the system prompt, it now depends completely on llms ability to generate a good search for the vector store, so accuracy will be less
[2023-11-22, 17:42:38] Dev Aggarwal: Get top 64 functions from vector db and pass to regular functions api?

[2023-11-22, 18:01:56] Pratyush Choudhury: This is cool - what kind of applications do we see here? 

Being able to switch b/w OSS & popularly used LLMs?
[2023-11-22, 18:01:57] Pratyush Choudhury: Also, will it make sense to have it inside LangChain?
[2023-11-22, 18:03:32] Rohit Aggarwal: Are AI engineers ready to give routing control to another LLM? Genuinely curious
[2023-11-22, 18:03:33] Rohit Aggarwal: they already have “routers” I think
[2023-11-22, 18:04:35] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Maintain the same quality of output at a much lower cost. But this might just switch between 3.5 and 4 for most of the usecases. (10-15% reduction in cost is still great though)
[2023-11-22, 18:06:33] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Is there no black Friday offer on openai credits?
[2023-11-22, 18:06:56] Nirant K: Absolutely. I want to give it away. I don't want to think about optimising this. It's like parameter optim to me mentally — important, but not worth the effort. Throw dollar (compute) and get done with it
[2023-11-22, 18:09:02] ~ Chirag: But on what basis would you route? Just prompt categories like summarization etc?
[2023-11-22, 18:10:10] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: They say they have done lot of RL where the router is able to identify best which model works best and optimise for quality and cost
[2023-11-22, 18:10:40] Nirant K: Better: Mentally, treat the LM as a param and run an ongoing param search on it. Let me set a preference "mode" e.g. best perf, best uptime and so on.
[2023-11-22, 18:11:02] Nirant K: LM is a param since 2016 anyway — we've treated them as such in pipeline design already
[2023-11-22, 18:12:38] ~ Anjineyulu: May be a forecasting model,yes!!!
[2023-11-22, 18:13:24] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I will be interested to see how this works. But I think this is an idea especially if you have multiple 13b finetuned models
[2023-11-22, 18:14:12] ~ Chirag: if you already have multiple finetuned models, why would you even need automatic routing?
[2023-11-22, 18:14:39] ~ Chirag: won't you already know which prompt to send to which model?
[2023-11-22, 18:15:24] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: You can do that even now without the need for an AI router.
[2023-11-22, 18:15:49] Amal David Futuryze: Take copilot use cases for example, that's primarily chat driven but when I ask it to perform a task, it routes to separate LLM. Primarily agent specific usecases
[2023-11-22, 18:38:27] Swastik Banerjee: I have a question for the community. 
For people working in Search/retrieval systems: how important do you think is it to measure the improvements you’ve made in a quantitative aspect, and what metrics have you chosen to quantify these improvements in retrieval-based results?
[2023-11-22, 18:40:04] Swastik Banerjee: recall@k, MRR, etc. are obviously there, but how often do you go about to measure these in each improvement effort (if at all), and how?
[2023-11-22, 18:47:10] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: (1) Is this general purpose router, or do we have to tune with our prompts for specific applications? (2) How difficult it is just to train small LM to behave as router? 
LlamaIndex has this concepts of adapters and router, probably using GPT4. @919550164716, can you provide some info with this regards? This is very important going forward, as I am already trying to route KB, DB calls, and I'm sure it is going to be hot topic soon.
[2023-11-22, 19:07:19] Ravi Theja: We have abstractions to finetune router. You can check it here - https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/latest/examples/finetuning/router/router_finetune.html
[2023-11-22, 20:55:24] ~ Katya: What is the advantage to using a router versus something more explainable and controllable like a classic classifier?
[2023-11-22, 20:56:57] ~ Katya: Grappling with this on my current team. We have something called an intent classifier trained on data we generated ourselves. The results of the classification are then very easy to interpret as they are not generated by LLM and this makes for a much faster/explainable solution.
[2023-11-22, 21:01:05] Sumba: +1 on the question
[2023-11-22, 21:01:10] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Better handling of Out of data  sample, but depending on the  usecase your solution might be a much better fit
[2023-11-22, 21:01:24] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Data distribution *
[2023-11-22, 21:02:29] Sumba: What cases uniquely are you saying the router would make more sense ? (Than to come up with a classical approach)
[2023-11-22, 21:17:09] ~ Onkar Mishra: Yesterday I used Ooogabooga textgen webui for llama2. It is somewhat similar to automatic1111 for stable diffusion. Ooogabooga looked easy to setup.
[2023-11-22, 21:18:29] ~ Mohammed: LLMStudio app is also good for running OSS LLMs and for having a chat interface

[2023-11-22, 21:53:23] Chetanya Rastogi: Don't know specifically for the Assistants API but yeah storing the function spec with a semantic description in a vectorDB and retrieving top k relevant functions at runtime is scalable. Another signal for retrieving the right set of functions could also be to add some sample queries for each function and do a query similarity check ( could be another vector DB or the same one depends on the implementation). I implemented the latter and we were able to scale up to >100 functions and got >95% retrieval accuracy by only selecting top 5.

[2023-11-23, 09:51:42] Paras Chopra Wingify: What’s QRHLF
[2023-11-23, 09:51:52] Nirant K: OpenAI is in Revenge Shipping mode?
[2023-11-23, 09:52:12] Nirant K: OpenAI doing PR like they always have

[2023-11-23, 09:54:36] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Yeah, did you see elons comments? I'm assuming I read a similar article in MIT Tech where hassabis was actually telling the same thing, fundamentals of alph go mixed with Palm 2

[2023-11-23, 09:58:46] ~ Sukuru Sai Vineet: I didn't understand how you learn the Q value of a token to do graph search on, anyone got any hypothesis?
[2023-11-23, 10:00:14] ~ Sukuru Sai Vineet: Positive steelman argument: they did the experiments on a small model, and are expecting great scaling laws
[2023-11-23, 10:00:29] ~ Sukuru Sai Vineet: And so Ilya might have "felt the AGI" xD
[2023-11-23, 10:03:31] Paras Chopra Wingify: To be fair, we also reason by doing some sort of A* in the head.
[2023-11-23, 10:04:46] ~ Sukuru Sai Vineet: Very true, we sort of frame multiple hypotheses and assign heuristics, explore most potentially rewarding paths in A* style
[2023-11-23, 10:05:42] ~ Sukuru Sai Vineet: Reminds me how they make you go from brute force to fancy trick solutions in DSA interviews xD
[2023-11-23, 10:06:37] ~ Sukuru Sai Vineet: Very interested in how someone would approach this, we can get together and experiment on 7B or 13B models
[2023-11-23, 10:09:36] Paras Chopra Wingify: https://twitter.com/McaleerStephen/status/1727524295377596645
[2023-11-23, 10:14:08] ~ Sukuru Sai Vineet: This paper describes Q learning+ A star for solving a Rubik's cube. My question was slightly different
[2023-11-23, 10:14:27] ~ Sukuru Sai Vineet: How do you frame and learn the heuristics for token exploration?
[2023-11-23, 10:14:42] ~ Sukuru Sai Vineet: What makes a token more heuristically probable to yield better reasoning, etc
[2023-11-23, 10:20:34] Sachin Legaltech: Probably rather than token, they are searching over thoughts. Generate a bunch of possible next thoughts, with process supervision (https://openai.com/research/improving-mathematical-reasoning-with-process-supervision) aka reward shaping train a reward model to rank usefulness of each thought and now you can use A* to explore the tree. Here Q(prompt + previous thoughts = state, next thought as action) will be predicted by reward model.
[2023-11-23, 10:26:47] Paras Chopra Wingify: How are thoughts defined? Some state vector of activations?
[2023-11-23, 10:30:46] ~ whyshock: is this anything like that coding from the screenshot example?
[2023-11-23, 10:32:24] Sachin Legaltech: Most naive way would be to consider every statement as a thought.
[2023-11-23, 10:34:03] Sachin Legaltech: If there is a curated dataset of how humans are solving things step-by-step, then can finetune a model where there is a token for end-of-thought
‎[2023-11-23, 10:34:15] Paras Chopra Wingify: ‎image omitted
[2023-11-23, 10:35:30] Paras Chopra Wingify: Maybe they’re having a RL agent give feedback to correct reasoning errors

(From HN comment)

RL might be approximating A* or trained at approximating A*
[2023-11-23, 10:35:39] Paras Chopra Wingify: It’s likely two models going two and fro
[2023-11-23, 10:35:47] Paras Chopra Wingify: Even GPT4 is likely multiple models
[2023-11-23, 10:36:54] Sankalp PickYourTrail: Has anyone implemented Q* optimisations with LLaMa yet
[2023-11-23, 10:37:14] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Are they doing this on top of GPT4 or they have a new one
[2023-11-23, 10:57:45] Sachin Legaltech: RL algorithms are usually helpful when we can’t backtrack. If we can sample the action, witness future state and decide to not take the action, planning algorithms win. So we might see at training time using lots of planning algorithms to generate different trajectories and putting that knowledge or bias towards particular actions in a network. Then at inference time, mostly use the network to limit compute consumption .
[2023-11-23, 10:57:50] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Try tddGPT. It can generate a functional react app from a screenshot and user stories.

[2023-11-23, 10:59:30] Paras Chopra Wingify: Don’t RL algorithms approximate / learn planning algorithms 

To me, they’re in the same class
[2023-11-23, 11:00:33] Sachin Legaltech: They are …my bad for fudging the meaning.

I am working on a project where I am trying to do story boarding with images and I want some kind of continuity among pictures so it can tell a story better. I tried playing with prompts and using image to image models but nothing seems to work. I have been looking for possible solutions that can work. Any idea or leads I can explore?
[2023-11-23, 14:37:38] Diwank Thiel Fellow: LCM painting?
[2023-11-23, 14:44:16] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: Its a bit of an involved solution but fine tuning stable diffusion, along with check point merging etc could work. 
I’m no expert on this but I know people have made this work.
[2023-11-23, 14:45:34] ~ Neeraj: Oh! Thanks a lot! 
Any suggestions for possible data I can use? 😅
[2023-11-23, 14:47:40] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: It really depends on your domain and use case. Unfortunately I have only done basic fine tunes with generic datasets without the requirements you have.. 
maybe check out automatic1111 to see what people are doing in this space.
[2023-11-23, 14:48:22] ~ Neeraj: I just breafly looked into it. I will do a deeper dive. 
Thanks
[2023-11-23, 14:49:05] ~ Neeraj: Honestly, I am doing a poc for now and achieving continuity is important more than how the output looks like. So any suggestion would be great
[2023-11-23, 14:51:37] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Use dalle? There is a way in that to keep consistency of the main character after you describe it. A Twitter user by the name Ashutosh Srivastva had posted on it
[2023-11-23, 14:53:59] ~ Neeraj: Oh! Let me check this out as well. 
Apparente this 😄
[2023-11-23, 14:54:54] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: @919629772025 can you help? You did the same thing
[2023-11-23, 14:56:01] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Actually, now that we are talking of images, what’s the best way to regenerate but keep as close as possible to original image.

Just the seed value in SD or are there other tricks as well? I know it will be similar output not the same. For a workflow we generate an image and then do canny + depth and regenerate. Want this regenerate to be as close as possible to original image generated
[2023-11-23, 14:57:22] Gaurav MonsterAPI Qblocks: Do you want a completely new environment / look of the default image or just change a part of the default image? 
If it’s the latter then you’d be good with pix2pix model
[2023-11-23, 14:59:38] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: I generate an image with a prompt (say a wooden table next to a blue wall) and then regenerate (with same prompt + multi control net of canny + depth on the original image). It obviously carries forward the composition but somehow looses a lot of image colours, details as it goes from 1st image to second 

Any ideas? 💡
[2023-11-23, 14:59:51] ~ Clament John: For consistency you can use the same seed. You still need to prompt to get the correct style (hair, clothing etc) occasionally. But works pretty well
[2023-11-23, 15:00:26] ~ Clament John: Here is an experiment I did. Made a convincing comic strip

[2023-11-23, 15:09:55] ~ Neeraj: But can we control the change as well? If we cannot then we cannot address continuity right?
[2023-11-23, 15:11:03] ~ Neeraj: So I tried something similar. It definitely produces similar results but it was still far away from what I wanted but a decent start. Also, I did not explore it as much as I would like so will do that too
[2023-11-23, 15:12:40] ~ Neeraj: This is great! I will look into other
[2023-11-23, 15:14:13] ~ Neeraj: That would be great man! I can play around with them and report back my findings and any more experiments I might end up doing. Let me know how can I consume these workflows

[2023-11-23, 18:55:54] Kshitij Agrawal ML Engineer: Frankly it depends on the task. At the high level this should be good. Gpt3.5T can work with as few as 100-200 samples. You can try benchmarking a 7B model as well and compare.
[2023-11-23, 18:56:29] Amogh V: You should first draw a very rough image using blobs of paint of brown table and blue wall background. Totally potato quality is also ok. Img2img with high denoise and good prompt. For repeating the scene just generate again with same seed
[2023-11-23, 18:57:48] Amogh V: Like draw a new rough sketch of table and wall and use same seed and denoise value for img2img
[2023-11-23, 18:58:14] Amogh V: That way you can control the placement and shot style reasonably
[2023-11-23, 18:58:56] ~ Neeraj: Yeah man!
[2023-11-23, 19:00:52] Amogh V: Take a celeb’s face of which you will get many photos. Use roop face swap to swap in someone else’s face. Fast and easy hack
[2023-11-23, 19:02:07] Amogh V: Now you have a dataset of your new faced character. Use a fat celeb if you want a fat character. Thin, muscular however you want the final output to look
[2023-11-23, 19:02:32] Pranjal Mehta: Can you talk about these in your newsletter? Will encourage more people to list and apply?

[2023-11-23, 19:40:28] Nirant K: There might be more folks interested on the Policy group. This might get buried here.
[2023-11-23, 19:46:03] Nirant K: Hiring support is out of scope for the community rn. Hence, don't want to encourage it.

There is a tactical lack of alignment too — we want to encourage intimacy, interaction & trust, while the job & event boards themselves are transactional with bulk of the posting there is from folks who've never contributed to the group
[2023-11-23, 19:46:14] Nirant K: If there are lot of active folks who're interested in using the community for something they'd want to pay for, can consider doing that ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-23, 21:48:46] Nishant Apne-App GenAI Hackathon: James betker, guessing by jbetker
[2023-11-23, 21:53:58] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: That proves my point that I made last week. Data quality is the key. Even small models can do wonder if one’s data set is highly curated.
[2023-11-23, 21:54:46] Priyank Agrawal: I mean wasn't that always the case with anything in ML? 

The quality of data is king has always been the sentence used.
[2023-11-23, 22:05:35] Varshul Dubverse: Betker aka neonbjb. He worked solo on tortoise(first large speech open source model) for 2 years before joining openai and then heading Dalle3 project.

[2023-11-23, 22:33:06] Maruti Agarwal: Google has more data that probably anyone else.
[2023-11-23, 22:35:05] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Not more data, Quality of data.
[2023-11-23, 22:35:41] Maruti Agarwal: Do you think anyone betas Google on that? :)

[2023-11-23, 22:36:13] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: More data doesn't mean quality of data
[2023-11-23, 22:36:45] Maruti Agarwal: Yea. But google has massive amount of structured data into what people type and look for. How to answer them.
[2023-11-23, 22:37:03] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: That's not quality data
[2023-11-23, 22:37:47] Maruti Agarwal: It’s gonna be a long discussion :) we might take it outside
[2023-11-23, 22:38:05] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Explore a few datasets, Orobors or others that are open and being used to train some OSS models
[2023-11-23, 22:40:22] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Alex Wang, scaleAI, made millions helping OAI curate their datasets
[2023-11-23, 22:42:31] Maruti Agarwal: ScaleAI has been doing for most Fortune 500 companies. All kind of datasets. I am very well aware of their ecosystem. This is equally available to google and oai.
[2023-11-23, 22:49:05] ~ YP: yes
[2023-11-23, 22:50:14] ~ YP: Curation - quality of pipeline. Taste. It's hard to clean data after a point thinking you're done - and it turns out oh you can push more
[2023-11-23, 23:04:42] Maruti Agarwal: My point is whatever OAI did to get better data… google can surpass that hands down…of course, now OpenAI has interaction data but originally they didn’t….
[2023-11-23, 23:05:51] Shikhil Kumar Gupta: Folks, How we can ensure Assistant API to return corresponding link as well, along with answer.

[2023-11-24, 03:22:37] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: Thanks a lot for sharing. It was a good watch where I learnt something new. For those who haven’t watched it yet, the first half is what probably everyone knows in terms of pre-training, fine-tuning and RLHF.

The second part was what I found more interesting where he talks about directions of future research (System 2 thinking for LLMs, self learning), idea of LLMs as an OS and what was very new for me was the various types of prompt injection attacks! There was an example where a base64 encoded version of the same prompt made the model give the response! I wonder if there are LLM security/white-hat startups/consultants already.
[2023-11-24, 07:33:09] Shikhil Kumar Gupta: Folks, Any thought, how this could be achieved?

[2023-11-24, 11:39:47] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I agree. But I think our own neurological systems perform some level of quantization as well which when approximated can get us there along with what Yann LeCunn said
[2023-11-24, 11:41:39] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Do we have any one who can share some learning on continuous pre-training with Mistral?
[2023-11-24, 11:42:08] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: https://nonint.com/2023/06/10/the-it-in-ai-models-is-the-dataset/

This disagrees
[2023-11-24, 11:43:31] Rajesh Parikh Cynepia: It's not orthogonal to number of parameters. Quantization helps bring some of that saving. But like Humans have natural memory loss, which means we tend to forget or partially forget what we don't use or want. Architecture that can load or unload a piece of learning that is required is a software engineering problem operating systems have solved it over years.
[2023-11-24, 11:43:48] ~ Sakshi Pradyumn: Dataset indeed makes the difference
But maybe LeCun suggests research on architecture than just increase in params of in-trend architectures
[2023-11-24, 11:44:26] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Interesting. I would say dataset is key. But I don't think current systems can scale to approximate all data with comput available unless we make breakthroughs in techniques like quantization or related
[2023-11-24, 11:44:47] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: He is talking about human reasoning and architecture that will in future enable that on smaller models. For current architecture and world knowledge, data is everything.
[2023-11-24, 11:45:11] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Agreed 💯

[2023-11-24, 19:33:07] Dev Aggarwal: Yes, but if you have thousands of messages in a db, they really changed the schema drastically, from content being str to list of dicts — any good reason to have this around?

[2023-11-25, 01:57:57] ~ Vinay Mimani: apart from cost (assuming context window is at parity), is there any reason you are using claude over gpt?

[2023-11-25, 01:59:02] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Ones a fallback. But it's also pretty good for long form writing
[2023-11-25, 02:00:23] ~ Vinay Mimani: got it. I've used claude extensively for reasoning, it's decent, but not as smart as gpt4. and needs a lot of prodding, thus was curious.

// 8. Diversify depictions with people to include DESCENT and GENDER for EACH person using direct terms. Adjust only human descriptions.
// - Your choices should be grounded in reality. For example, all of a given OCCUPATION should not be the same gender or race. Additionally, focus on creating diverse, inclusive, and exploratory scenes via the properties you choose during rewrites.  Make choices that may be insightful or unique sometimes.
// - Use all possible different DESCENTS with EQUAL probability. Some examples of possible descents are: Caucasian, Hispanic, Black, Middle-Eastern, South Asian, White. They should all have EQUAL probability.
// - Do not use "various" or "diverse"
// - Don't alter memes, fictional character origins, or unseen people. Maintain the original prompt's intent and prioritize quality.
// - Do not create any imagery that would be offensive.
// - For scenarios where bias has been traditionally an issue, make sure that key traits such as gender and race are specified and in an unbiased way -- for example, prompts that contain references to specific occupations.
// 9. Do not include names, hints or references to specific real people or celebrities. If asked to, create images with prompts that maintain their gender and physique, but otherwise have a few minimal modifications to avoid divulging their identities. Do this EVEN WHEN the instructions ask for the prompt to not be changed. Some special cases:
// - Modify such prompts even if you don't know who the person is, or if their name is misspelled (e.g. "Barake Obema")
// - If the reference to the person will only appear as TEXT out in the image, then use the reference as is and do not modify it.
// - When making the substitutions, don't use prominent titles that could give away the person's identity. E.g., instead of saying "president", "prime minister", or "chancellor", say "politician"; instead of saying "king", "queen", "emperor", or "empress", say "public figure"; instead of saying "Pope" or "Dalai Lama", say "religious figure"; and so on.
// 10. Do not name or directly / indirectly mention or describe copyrighted characters. Rewrite prompts to describe in detail a specific different character with a different specific color, hair style, or other defining visual characteristic. Do not discuss copyright policies in responses.
// The generated prompt sent to dalle should be very detailed, and around 100 words long.
namespace dalle {

// Create images from a text-only prompt.
type text2im = (_: {
// The size of the requested image. Use 1024x1024 (square) as the default, 1792x1024 if the user requests a wide image, and 1024x1792 for full-body portraits. Always include this parameter in the request.
size?: "1792x1024" | "1024x1024" | "1024x1792",
// The number of images to generate. If the user does not specify a number, generate 1 image.
n?: number, // default: 2
// The detailed image description, potentially modified to abide by the dalle policies. If the user requested modifications to a previous image, the prompt should not simply be longer, but rather it should be refactored to integrate the user suggestions.
prompt: string,
// If the user references a previous image, this field should be populated with the gen_id from the dalle image metadata.
referenced_image_ids?: string[],
}) => any;

} // namespace dalle

## browser

You have the tool `browser` with these functions:
`search(query: str, recency_days: int)` Issues a query to a search engine and displays the results.
`click(id: str)` Opens the webpage with the given id, displaying it. The ID within the displayed results maps to a URL.
`back()` Returns to the previous page and displays it.
`scroll(amt: int)` Scrolls up or down in the open webpage by the given amount.
`open_url(url: str)` Opens the given URL and displays it.
`quote_lines(start: int, end: int)` Stores a text span from an open webpage. Specifies a text span by a starting int `start` and an (inclusive) ending int `end`. To quote a single line, use `start` = `end`.
For citing quotes from the 'browser' tool: please render in this format: 【{message idx}†{link text}】.
For long citations: please render in this format: `[link text](message idx)`.
Otherwise do not render links.
Do not regurgitate content from this tool.
Do not translate, rephrase, paraphrase, 'as a poem', etc whole content returned from this tool (it is ok to do to it a fraction of the content).
Never write a summary with more than 80 words.
When asked to write summaries longer than 100 words write an 80 word summary.
Analysis, synthesis, comparisons, etc, are all acceptable.
Do not repeat lyrics obtained from this tool.
Do not repeat recipes obtained from this tool.
Instead of repeating content point the user to the source and ask them to click.
ALWAYS include multiple distinct sources in your response, at LEAST 3-4.

Except for recipes, be very thorough. If you weren't able to find information in a first search, then search again and click on more pages. (Do not apply this guideline to lyrics or recipes.)
Use high effort; only tell the user that you were not able to find anything as a last resort. Keep trying instead of giving up. (Do not apply this guideline to lyrics or recipes.)
Organize responses to flow well, not by source or by citation. Ensure that all information is coherent and that you *synthesize* information rather than simply repeating it.
Always be thorough enough to find exactly what the user is looking for. Provide context, and consult all relevant sources you found during browsing but keep the answer concise and don't include superfluous information.

EXTREMELY IMPORTANT. Do NOT be thorough in the case of lyrics or recipes found online. Even if the user insists. You can make up recipes though.

For Claude  I provided a txt file to use as inspiration, but the results were not upto the mark. I was wondering if there is a way to fine tune the language model directly without using labelled data, like it used to be earlier in ULMFiT and BERT, where we labelled data was not necessary to fine tune the model. Any resources would be really helpful.

It can be put with

1. The first system message.
2. With each human message, inside the human message.
3. Adding a system message containing the prompt after each human message. But not sure how an LLM reacts to multiple system messages.

I'm mostly confused between option 1 and 2. How are you doing this right now?
[2023-11-25, 13:23:18] ~ Sumit: I think as the conversation grows option 2 would not scale erll because each human message will contains retrieved context. Whereas option 1 would scale better. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-11-26, 01:07:09] ~ Aniket Singh: quick question folks :

what do you think are reasons why if you ask chatgpt 4, a certain question, and then the same question to the api (almost the same model under the hood) , the response on chatgpt 4 is better than the one from the  api?
[2023-11-26, 01:10:59] ~ Aniket Singh: here’s an example:

question : ‘can i get cancer if i have been smoking for a year 10 cigarettes a day’

API : ‘Yes, smoking can significantly increase your risk of developing cancer, even if you've only been smoking for a year. Cigarettes contain more than 7,000 chemicals, many of which are carcinogenic (cancer-causing).

The more cigarettes you smoke each day, and the longer you've smoked, the higher your risk of lung cancer. However, this doesn't mean that light smokers or those who have smoked for a short period of time are safe. Even a small amount of smoking can increase your risk.

It's important to note that while smoking is a leading cause of lung cancer, it also increases the risk of other types of cancer, including:

- Oral cancer
- Throat cancer
- Esophageal cancer
- Pancreatic cancer
- Bladder cancer
- Kidney cancer
- Cervical cancer
- Stomach cancer
- Liver cancer
- Colon cancer

It's never too late to quit smoking. The sooner you quit, the more you can reduce your risk of cancer and other health problems. If you need help quitting, there are many resources available, including nicotine replacement therapies, prescription medications, and support groups. It's always a good idea to talk to your healthcare provider about your smoking habits and any concerns you may have about your health.’


CHATGPT: ‘Smoking, even for a relatively short period like a year, increases your risk of developing cancer and other health issues. The risk of cancer and other diseases generally increases with the duration and intensity of smoking. However, it's important to remember that cancer development is influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, environmental exposures, and more. Not everyone who smokes will develop cancer, but smoking significantly increases the risk.

If you've been smoking 10 cigarettes a day for a year, it's advisable to consider quitting to reduce your health risks. The benefits of quitting smoking begin almost immediately and continue to improve health over time. It's never too late to quit, and there are many resources available to help with smoking cessation. If you're concerned about your health risks due to smoking, it's a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and support.’
[2023-11-26, 02:07:00] ~ Dimos Anagnostopoulos: Out of the 978 members i bet at least one smokes, whose saturday night is just ruined
[2023-11-26, 03:10:30] Chetanya Rastogi: We don't know what the param settings for chatgpt are, temperature could be different. And also the starting prompt in chatgpt app (which I think is the main reason).

That's the reason for being different, as for better I think you can craft a system prompt to align the tone/style as you like
[2023-11-26, 08:21:57] ~ Sid: has anyone worked on voice cloning here? would love to try this. where could I find some offline models?

[2023-11-26, 09:11:13] Bharat Kumar Ramesh Hashmal Web3: Folks, reaching out for some help. What is the single platform you would recommend to host & fine-tune a model, and get inference endpoints easily?

Anything that comes close to the plug and play convenience that openai provides.

Any guides or docs would also be really helpful. Thanks a lot

Additional context: I need a model that gets better at classifying intent for incoming messages based on how the user has classified in the past. Different users or sets of users may have different preferences for how they classify the messages
[2023-11-26, 09:39:26] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: He's definitely on to something. Makes complete sense to replace fine tuning with a verifier model. Something like system 1 and system 2 thinking.

[2023-11-26, 10:47:16] ~ Jeff from Gearsk: What current LLMs can do is not possible by humans at least 90% of the cases. So, scaling parameters is reasonable.
[2023-11-26, 10:57:34] ~ Pankaj Chawla: I gave it a quick spin. For starters, it lacks local context. Eg, I asked for help on a coffee shop in Dehradun. It told me to add filter coffee in the menu. Local context in my mind is the biggest challenge with foundational models and we have discussed that in the context of fashion, art etc. So I guess the next steps would be to figure out how to add the local context and data. Eg, the model could not get me any data for a lot of things I asked in the context of cafe business in Dehradun despite using the browser function each time.
[2023-11-26, 11:01:37] ~ SJ: Huggingface

[2023-11-26, 11:07:06] ~ Pankaj Chawla: For fashion and art, we tried training a lot of loras. Insights would be an interesting problem as I am sure the localised data like demography, people preferences, seasonality etc for say Dehradun may not even be available.
[2023-11-26, 11:12:24] ~ Pankaj Chawla: As my cofounder yesterday again  reemphasised to me, model is not the moat, data is.

[2023-11-26, 11:17:33] ~ Pankaj Chawla: He meant to build a model also, you need the right data. In the context of art, you need data to help model differentiate between madubani art vs kerala mural art vs anything. The model is what it is trained on.

[2023-11-26, 13:00:40] Pratik Bhavasar: If they really want to find it out about a dataset, they can use OpenAI model log probs. But if dataset is private, they mostly cannot. 

But the above is another discussion in itself. The question here is about datasets openly stating they were GPT generated and models stating they used it.
[2023-11-26, 13:01:41] Pratik Bhavasar: The goal is to compete in “chat” task rather than any narrow task. I think Huggingface and Teknium clearly state it.

But on pragmatic side, they obviously have your IP address, email and who knows what future technology can reverse engineer data used to fine tune a model
[2023-11-26, 14:09:11] ~ Pankaj Chawla: Story from 1996-97, a few engineers from Cadence left Cadence and started a new company called Avanti. A few years later, Cadence support gets a call from a customer asking for a fix. They were Avanti customer and not Cadence. The software, though, threw an error "Contact Cadence Support  for more details" for an error situation. Thus started a saga of a legal battle that lasted almost a decade. One small error message the folks who stole the code forgot to change. The point is that there are always breadcrunch that get left behind.

[2023-11-26, 15:14:52] ~ Anuruddh: I think the general move from even large companies has been to stop declaring what data was used to train the model. This is mostly to avoid copyright lawsuits.

In order to understand if copyrighted material was used, people might be made to disclose data used in some format (privately probably, not publicly)
[2023-11-26, 16:23:13] ~ Karthik Prabhu: If they file a suit, it'll come out in discovery
[2023-11-26, 16:23:35] ~ Karthik Prabhu: Mostly they would get to know from whistle-blower employees and if the company doing this is pretty big/high valuation
[2023-11-26, 16:25:18] ~ Karthik Prabhu: Genai scientists have good networks with openai employees, cash incentive for whistleblowing is more than enough

[2023-11-26, 17:25:15] Nirant K: What happens if I use OpenHermes2.5 or Llama outputs to train a new model? 
What about RLHF on OpenAI output? 
What if I take the OAI output and perturb it in some way e.g. use a BERTAug? 
What about using GPT4 as RLAIF for my model? 

Basically, what counts as "OpenAI output"? 
[2023-11-26, 17:26:05] Nirant K: Rephrasing: The mental model that the OpenAI model output is "text" is incomplete. It's a mix of reasoning, safety, grammar, and few other things which gets captured in text. 
[2023-11-26, 17:40:37] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: And what happens if I scrape data from the internet that is already populated with content from gpt 4? Use it to maybe train my model. Would that still be valid as I am using "output from openai models" right?
[2023-11-26, 17:40:37] Pratik Bhavasar: Any output derived from OpenAI outputs is still OpenAI output.
[2023-11-26, 17:40:42] ~ YP: Entire internet is bleeded with OpenAI text - but then yeah omitting OpenAI safety messages must do

GPT4v describes images in peculiar way and a bit of cleaning goes a long way
[2023-11-26, 17:46:06] ~ Apurva Bhatt: I m more concerned with the fact that one may train on data that is over lapping with openAI models
[2023-11-26, 17:52:43] ~ Pankaj Chawla: In general since OpenAI itself is training on scrapped data a lot of which is copyrighted, them going ahead and filling a lawsuit against somebody can potentially open them also for scrutiny, so there is that no first use safety net for all. Once the pandora box opens, then it's all left to the lawyers and how the laws are interpreted based on evidence provided.
[2023-11-26, 17:55:54] Pratik Bhavasar: Yeah that seems to be the scenario. It’s about the tipping point of when they get pissed. Lawyer cost wise OpenAI + MSFT can outrank many. 

The new models will be trained on more and more synthetic data which will make this debugging even more complicated.
[2023-11-26, 18:54:20] Abhishek Mishra: There are some models that literally mention they have been trained by openAI. Mostly because of either scraping sharegpt data or being fine tuned on distilled conversations. ‎<This message was edited>

My take on using synthetic datasets generated by an LLM willy nilly to train other LLMs is this as of today 😂. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-26, 21:36:53] Priyesh OnFinance: what is a better argument in favor of this is that I have no money to curate a high quality dataset to train my own LLM and I assume that the SOTA currently is using vv high quality closed-source dataset.

Hence I will use the big LLM's learnings from that dataset to train my own. This is completely valid.

[2023-11-27, 09:36:22] Priyank Agrawal: Any tips to get gpt 3.5, to NOT say hmiayt / how may i assist you today '?

I have tried the following in the instructions - 
1. Never say hmiayt
2. Important never ask/suggest hmiayt
3. Reduced temperature to 0.3 topp is 1.

The 2nd and 3rd combined option works 90% of the time, but it's production env so I can't allow 10%
[2023-11-27, 09:49:22] ~ Ashish Singhal: You can use "strictly" , "mandatorily" and such similar keywords and try to tune your instruction
[2023-11-27, 09:57:00] Priyank Agrawal: I have a 'strictly follow the instructions' part, but will try with the never hmiayt clause.

Part of the problem is it happens only 10% of the time, so it's not easy to debug either

[2023-11-27, 10:09:50] ~ Ashish Singhal: Try reducing temperature to 0.001

The idea is to keep lowest temperature (0) possible but if it's 0 it might get reset to default value. Hence 0.001
[2023-11-27, 10:39:32] ~ Jasmeet: I am not sure of the context in your case, but we have a conversation bot, and adding the previous interaction history in the prompt helped us get rid of any unnecessary greetings as well as hmiayt to almost negligible level.
[2023-11-27, 10:39:38] ~ Rushabh: Add an additional llm checker, which checks if hmiayt is there in the response. If present, handle it.
[2023-11-27, 10:47:09] Priyank Agrawal: In my case it happens at the start of the conversation, when the user says the first hi/hey
[2023-11-27, 10:47:57] Priyank Agrawal: Fair solution. But speed will go down, i need to keep it under 1 sec

[2023-11-27, 16:10:59] ~ Amit Sharma: Ques on AssistantAPI: 
====== From documentation ==============
How it works
The model then decides when to retrieve content based on the user Messages. The Assistants API automatically chooses between two retrieval techniques:

it either passes the file content in the prompt for short documents, or
performs a vector search for longer documents
Retrieval currently optimizes for quality by adding all relevant content to the context of model calls. We plan to introduce other retrieval strategies to enable developers to choose a different tradeoff between retrieval quality and model usage cost.
============
Is anyone able to decipher how this is working (if its working at all)?
[2023-11-27, 16:17:36] Vishwam Jindal Webnyay: Similar discussion happening here too: https://community.openai.com/t/understanding-the-current-assistant-retrieval-process/507280

[2023-11-27, 17:57:43] ~ Bharath: For anyone who's tried emotion detection using LLMs (Not that it is the wisest thing to do cost-wise): have you noticed that if you ask the same question (identification of emotion) in successive messages of the same chat thread for different texts the answer (the emotion) starts getting repeated after a point even if the text is of a different emotion? I noticed that with Llama 2 the problem occurred even from the second/third message or so. Closing the chat and opening a fresh one solves the problem.

My template for each message: 
<intro telling the LLM to detect emotion from a list of choices>
<list of choices>
<examples of correct emotion detection>
<text to detect emotion of>
[2023-11-27, 18:06:30] ~ Sushant: Has anyone made a training/teaching-bot using LLMs. 
anyone has an idea where i can start from ?

Want to design a "training" program where bot can ask questions to new sales/support representatives so that they have more confidence when they are asked same/similar questions in actual calls.

the dataset apart from knowledge base would be a large amount of previous conversations between support/sales reps with customers

basically some kind of simulation of how real world questions will be asked..

[2023-11-28, 12:52:37] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: i have been trying to get gpt3.5 to output sql queries based on a complex and vast database schema
the prompt format is something like this.
—
You are a SQL expert who can flawlessly write SQLqueries based on the data a user wants. 

You will be given the description of the tables in our schema. It has the following formats <table>, <description>, <column>
```
<table>details<\table>
<description>
<column>ID<\column>
…
<\description.
….repeat
```

When the query is asked, think along the following steps.
1. Which tables do you need from the tables we provided in the context?
2. Which fields do you need from the tables you selected from the step above? Use the context provided.
2. How can you join them?
3. What will be the SQL query generated?

Give a step by step by answer. 

—
the output has been bad and non consistent.. the model consistently makes up fields and table names.

any help is deeply appreciated!!
[2023-11-28, 12:59:14] Prakash Sankar Harbor: 1. We put in guidelines. Try changing the prompt to be <Intro> <guidelines> <data> <guidelines> --> this reduces hallucination.
2. Try and remove parts of the schema that are not relevant.
3. In guideliness you can add code examples --> this helps a lot
[2023-11-28, 12:59:52] Prakash Sankar Harbor: I also don't understand what you're asking the LLM for - the end output seems not clear, I suggest you get it to output stuff in a specific format and be clear about what that format is
[2023-11-28, 13:00:03] Prakash Sankar Harbor: probably better responses on the LLMs in prod group too
[2023-11-28, 13:05:38] ~ whyshock: I built out a custom prompt for my use case , but initially also it used to not hallucinate at all.

Flipside Query Crafter [ BETA ] specializes in generating Snowflake DB compatible queries using exclusively the tables from the provided eth_flipside.sql file. It crafts precise queries and Common Table Expressions (CTEs), drawing from its knowledge source contained in this specific SQL file. It analyzes the data structure within this file, ensuring all queries are optimized for the tables and data available. Beyond query generation, it interprets query results, offers insights, suggests data exploration techniques, and provides guidance on statistical methods and data visualization. It tailors its assistance to enhance the user's understanding and help them achieve advanced data analysis, strictly adhering to the information from the eth_flipside.sql file.

[2023-11-28, 13:12:02] Prakash Sankar Harbor: I'm sure you want it to do that, but your prompt isn't saying that

Has anyone tried that? How are the results?
[2023-11-29, 10:33:09] Sumba: Hey want to know if anyone has already worked on this task or know solutions online (DIY types) 

Basically, would be needing a copilot type of a chatbot 
Where in, for a given question/request from the user as natural text, the chatbot instructs the user on how to achieve what they have asked in our application

For example: I want to see volume of tickets handled by Jose in Zendesk 

The LLM agent should ideally say: 
To detect tickets on Zendesk, first navigate to Zendesk tab on your discover view with appropriate time period set

Then go to filters, select agent id. Jose from Zendesk has an agent id of 2000 so select the id 2000 in the agent filter.
[2023-11-29, 10:57:40] ~ Sushant: It is similar..
Azure..you still have to think about Azure AI Search indexing..as you have flexibility to choose the index, container and then all data essentially has to be in either files uploaded or in Azure blob storage.

AWS is taking a very much "one size fits all" approach to it and doing in the ingestion for you especially integration with Confluence, SFDC, etc

AWS(claude) currently has couple of problems - 

- each chat takes around 20-30s to respond
- the bot is pretty much open, so in "Chat with Data". you can get the bot to write python code, sql queries, which may not be what needed from enterprise perspective

Azure (openai) was handling this better last i checked

both are fine for most of the use cases of chat with data etc.

Future stability models are going to require a subscription for commercial use (probably 20$ a month until you reach yearly revenue of greater than 1m$)
[2023-11-29, 15:33:39] Prakash Sankar Harbor: sounds like someone told him to have easy to predict cashflow
[2023-11-29, 15:34:27] Prakash Sankar Harbor: does anyone here actually use the APIs for the other LLMs on the market?
[2023-11-29, 16:01:49] Arko C | xylem.ai: @919899951010 should be one of the best folks to answer this.

How have you seen non-GPT APIs being used on Portkey?
[2023-11-29, 16:05:12] Rohit Aggarwal: thanks, Arko!

We see 30% of our customers use multiple providers. OpenAI still dominates but we’re seeing use cases move to other providers and open source models..

Or did you mean models from stability?
[2023-11-29, 16:07:58] Prakash Sankar Harbor: so 70% are all openai?
[2023-11-29, 16:08:02] Prakash Sankar Harbor: *only

[2023-11-29, 19:51:59] Vignesh Baskaran: Thanks Charu. I've reached out to Divya to do the needful. Thank you
[2023-11-29, 20:11:44] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: Did I understand it correctly - model weights will still be open source but only for hobbyists and if you derive commercial benefit then you need to have the subscription?
[2023-11-29, 20:12:40] Prakash Sankar Harbor: ya
[2023-11-29, 20:13:38] Prakash Sankar Harbor: so distribution with model weights, predictable cashflow
[2023-11-29, 20:14:45] Prakash Sankar Harbor: idk why this model over charge per api call - I think maybe it's cos they can't guarantee that API calls will return?
[2023-11-29, 20:14:59] Prakash Sankar Harbor: it's a real annoyance with openai, that you might pay for a timeout
[2023-11-29, 20:15:35] Prakash Sankar Harbor: probably makes it easier to predict spikes
[2023-11-29, 21:03:02] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: But also harder to track illegal usage right? I mean what stops somebody from using a SDXL generated image in a YouTube video that is monetized
[2023-11-29, 21:24:47] ~ Sachin Kalsi: whoever using RAG, how you are managing queries such as 'get top players in,' 'recent executive update of X,' and 'least used product usage'? In other words, how are queries like 'top N,' 'recent,' 'least,' and 'bottom' handled?
[2023-11-29, 21:32:03] Arko C | xylem.ai: That’s less of a RAG and more of a DB Query (Text2Sql, Text2Mongo, etc) kinda use case ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-29, 21:36:00] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: Or function calling on custom REST APIs
[2023-11-29, 21:36:32] Arko C | xylem.ai: yeah that too
[2023-11-29, 21:36:46] Arko C | xylem.ai: Basically it’s natural language analytics
[2023-11-29, 21:42:53] ~ Sachin Kalsi: Yes Right. But we do also have queries which can be easily answerable through RAG (like, why sky is blue) 

Would hybrid approach suitable here ?
[2023-11-29, 21:45:35] Arko C | xylem.ai: Yes, I think having a routing logic would help. Like RAG for QA kinda prompts and DB queries for Analytical ones. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-29, 21:46:39] ~ Sachin Kalsi: You meant a simple classifier differentiating between DB vs RAG queries at the beginning?
[2023-11-29, 21:46:49] Arko C | xylem.ai: Yes
[2023-11-29, 21:48:02] ~ Sachin Kalsi: Ok
Thanks for the input
[2023-11-29, 21:54:54] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: You can use OpenAI's Assistant API with both function calling and retrieval enabled. You can also use LlamaIndex RAG with Assistant API instead of OpenAI's one. Basically function calling + RAG
[2023-11-29, 22:05:55] ~ Dimos Anagnostopoulos: Any tips on writing prompts to use chatgpt to extract entities from emails?
[2023-11-29, 22:09:41] ~ Sachin Kalsi: Okay noted. The challenge is we have 100+ APIs!
Thanks for the input
[2023-11-29, 22:13:42] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: You can try retrieving top k functions to pass to LLM. There was a discussion in this group regarding the same sometime back.
[2023-11-29, 22:16:32] ~ Sachin Kalsi: Oh thats good.
I will check this. Thank you :)

[2023-11-30, 08:42:39] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Even we are using Mistral to create semi-synthetic data
[2023-11-30, 08:43:49] ~ Anjineyulu: I would like to get some insights on strategies around that and best practices based on actual experience and it's influence on models
[2023-11-30, 08:44:18] ~ Anjineyulu: I am speaking in the context of diffusion models
[2023-11-30, 08:45:26] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Synthetic data + Diffusion Models?
[2023-11-30, 08:46:13] ~ Anjineyulu: Synthetic images
[2023-11-30, 08:49:34] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Not sure what your requirements are, but I can share my experience which may or may not be helpful. Last year in September, we mined 50K+ images using SD and curated to 20K. However, we had a huge knowledge base of commodities/crops, and my team manual tested large number of prompts before we started the actual run. ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-11-30, 08:55:14] ~ Anjineyulu: I mean how are models performing,any insights on using combination of actual images and Synthetic images to make model better
[2023-11-30, 09:00:43] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Ahh, that makes sense. 
I tried dreambooth for these images last year but didn't see much difference. It was very early, and I haven't worked on image models for a year now. Probably check out Deep Media group, folks are experimenting with image models and fine tuning there.
[2023-11-30, 09:02:36] ~ Anjineyulu: Sure
[2023-11-30, 09:12:23] Jay Pokarna 2014 BPCC: Thanks. Will check it out
[2023-11-30, 09:23:10] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: Could you elaborate or link me to some information on how Mistral has been useful in dataset curation? I’m not working with images but am interested to see how I could leverage it too.
[2023-11-30, 09:33:08] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: We are halfway there, and will publish our strategies and learnings once done releasing our model.
[2023-11-30, 09:38:45] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: How do you mitigate mode colapse?
[2023-11-30, 09:43:41] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: It's very important issue. We are not producing full synthetic data but have knowledge base of one-liner conversations, that we are converting into high-quality instructions. So there is a diversity but we will have to still check. However OH2.5 being used is not as potent as GPT4, so I'm planning to try testing results from both for smaller ~10k dataset.
[2023-11-30, 09:45:19] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: Instead of generating data, do you think data augmentation with instruction would be an easier task?
[2023-11-30, 09:45:53] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: If I use GPT4 for curation, it may cost me 100k, on other hand I'm firing 4 RTX GPUs at home with ollma for first 400k instructions.
[2023-11-30, 09:48:23] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I do have enough diversified (10M+) unique rows, I just have to make proper instruction set to fine tune, and I’m trying 100k-400k to begin with
[2023-11-30, 09:49:00] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Also the main task is building pipelines for each task, as we will be doing it for customers.
[2023-11-30, 10:30:04] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: Full finetune?
[2023-11-30, 10:38:13] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yeah

[2023-11-30, 12:01:48] ~ Utsav Goel: Hi Folks, We're using Openai assistant API with GPT-4-1106-preview  and retrieval tool. We have multiple data points saved as a list of JSON in a single file.
When asked a query, the assistant usually gets only 1 result and requires follow-up questions to retrieve all the results.
Tried with different prompts like:
"For a given user query ALWAYS perform multiple searches with a broad scope, read through the entire uploaded document, and provide the user with an exhaustive list of data"
The assistant could get multiple results but never the complete list of relevant results. When prompted again it mentions the reason as a document cutoff in myfiles_browser tool.
Is there a way to condition it to return all the relevant results in a single response?

Looking to understand how it went ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-12-01, 00:28:34] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Read about Spotify in India
[2023-12-01, 00:30:39] Ayush Yadav: They made the app kinda useless for free users.
[2023-12-01, 00:31:36] Ayush Yadav: & I'm not looking for giants, their data is not that relevant to me. They have scale.

Something that started small type.
[2023-12-01, 00:31:59] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Depends on the category
[2023-12-01, 00:32:41] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Ed you can look doubnut 
Content you can look STAGE 

gaming Ludo king maybe
[2023-12-01, 00:33:32] Ayush Yadav: The photo editor apps I looked in, they added watermark & an ad before you save the final image.
[2023-12-01, 00:35:12] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Yeah that's a common strategy, however revenue through ads is very lees, the multiples here are wayess than US

Emnlp two papers accepted
[2023-12-01, 07:45:15] ~ Onkar Mishra: Monetisation through ads is very less in a freemium app. We developed a photo editor app. Started with a paid app, then moved to a freemium app and now a subscription based app. 

I am not part of the team now but theyrun very less ads now. Revenue is mostly through subscription.
[2023-12-01, 08:28:12] Anshul Khandelwal Invideo: Does your app target only Indians?  We do freemium.
[2023-12-01, 08:40:58] Paras Chopra Wingify: Kuku FM

[2023-12-01, 08:42:48] Aditya Agrawal: @919920634169 Invideo has a 2 key events : one is video creation or studio and other is download and the second event let you guys monetise well because user wants to download that video and doesn’t have option to end the journey at first key event. Correct me if I’m wrong here .
[2023-12-01, 10:22:50] Anshul Khandelwal Invideo: Yep.  For freemium to work you need a good value prop to doing the upgrade.  In case of invideo AI it is removing watermarks and exporting.

So are the distiluse-base-multilingual and paraphrase-multilingual-miniLM

"Light" finetuning on target language and domain improves embedding models quite a bit, so give that a shot if you've not already
[2023-12-01, 14:52:28] Nirant K: Embedding model finetuning can be done with and without tagged data both — so shouldn't stop you from trying usually

anybody using stuff like argilla, etc ?
[2023-12-01, 15:35:00] Prashanth Harshangi Encrypt AI: dp-transformers for differentially private fine tuning. Has its shortcomings that it doesn't peft, trl.
[2023-12-01, 15:42:28] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: this is the new differential privacy transformers fork. well i was not referring to this - i was asking about creating and maintaining datasets for finetuning from a production standpoint. 
this includes labeling, version drift, etc

[2023-12-03, 12:20:15] Anand S Gramener: I tried llamafile. On my Windows GPU system, it was clean and easy to run.

The Llava 1.5 model from https://github.com/Mozilla-Ocho/llamafile works out of box once I renamed the `.llamafile` to `.llamafile.exe`. The speed was an acceptable 7.5 tokens per second.

Mistral 7B instruct ran at ~9 tokens per second. OpenHermes 2.5 Neural Chat v3 at ~6.8 tokens per second.

BTW, when downloading, I had to disable Windows Defender which detected Trojan:Win32/Wacatac.B!ml (hopefully a false positive.)

[2023-12-04, 13:59:12] Rishabh Refuel.ai: it's a very good point. Base Llama 2 is actually not very good at these tasks, but fine-tuning improves performance significantly. We saw this first-hand when we fine-tuned our own version: https://www.refuel.ai/blog-posts/announcing-refuel-llm

If using open-source is a hard constraint, I'd start with FLAN-T5-xxl, but eventually move towards fine-tuning llama 2-13b or mistral
[2023-12-04, 14:05:27] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: hey thanks for the advice. im planning on training it on https://developer.ibm.com/exchanges/data/all/fintabnet/ . not sure if u have a thought on that

As a general sequence model backbone, Mamba achieves state-of-the-art performance across several modalities such as language, audio, and genomics. On language modeling, our Mamba-3B model outperforms Transformers of the same size and matches Transformers twice its size, both in pretraining and downstream evaluation.

Also, wanted to know if fine-tuning these models will help to get structured json outputs.
[2023-12-05, 11:22:37] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Open-Hermes 2.5 Mistral is good at following instructions to generate JSON. I just did 100K instructions with an error rate of less than 0.5%
[2023-12-05, 11:34:56] Arko C | xylem.ai: You can try finetuning for overfitting these models to behave in a certain way. And you won’t need too much data to do this. 3-5k QA pairs should be enough.

We’ve fine-tuned wizardcoder-34B to stick to JSON responses and to also not be very “chatty”. So, it is pretty doable.

[2023-12-05, 11:40:13] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: This is pretty cool. I just found out when Amitabh kant spoke about it on stage.

[2023-12-05, 11:47:49] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Yes. Test APIs are.
[2023-12-05, 11:47:58] Saurabh Karn Nyai: If you need more info happy to chat
[2023-12-05, 11:54:16] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: What is the usecase you envision? Just curious. Any particular vision for usage, etc.
[2023-12-05, 12:00:35] Saurabh Karn Nyai: So there are a few use cases for this:
1) A vast number of NGOs have 30-40% of their org capacity occupied answering repeated questions from beneficiaries. Mere case ka date kya hai? Mere file ka status? Kaunsa scheme mereko ghar dila sakta hai and all that. Indian Languages + RAG Solves this widely. 

2) Scheme Search and enrollment: People usually don't know what schemes they are eligible for or if something is available. They usually know the problem they are facing. For example, Main ek kisan houn aur mujhe apna ghar banana hai OR main ek fastfood ki laari lagata houn aur mere ko loan chahiye business ke liye. Again Indian Languages + RAG Solves the search and delivery part.
[2023-12-05, 12:00:44] Saurabh Karn Nyai: The slightly more complex problem is like this
[2023-12-05, 12:01:42] Saurabh Karn Nyai: You have criteria for say around ~1000 schemes which could be things like, person should be from karnataka, less than 40 years old and at least 5 feet (just made up). How do you enable interaction and eligibility check in Indian languages.
[2023-12-05, 12:01:43] Lucifer 😎: If I apply HyDE in my pipeline and then at the end also apply the reranking strategy, will this drastically improve my retrieval relevance score ?

Can these two tech be used together ?
[2023-12-05, 12:02:20] Saurabh Karn Nyai: We used an FSM to get it to work and used LLM to convert and store eligibility criteria as a list of binary questions.
[2023-12-05, 12:02:55] Saurabh Karn Nyai: I had done a 5th Elephant session on this, but if this is of interest, can do a deeper dive for this group on what we actually did, taking through the data and code.
[2023-12-05, 12:05:54] Priyank Agrawal: Would be great
[2023-12-05, 12:06:37] Saurabh Karn Nyai: By the way this along with form filling is a great AI product problem
[2023-12-05, 12:10:08] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Reranking might be sufficient in some use case. Adding too many things might slow your pipeline down. So you will need to test it.
[2023-12-05, 12:14:15] Varshul Dubverse: Have always been a fan of this. How many languages does it cover? And what pipeline would have for audio based interaction?
[2023-12-05, 12:18:50] Saurabh Karn Nyai: It uses Bhashini language APIs as default but can work with Azure and Google services as well. We stitched WhatsApp APIs to enable this  with language services if that’s what you are asking.

[2023-12-05, 17:02:29] Divyam Goel: Maybe noob question - 
Step 1 -> I am using GPT 3.5 turbo for translating to Hinglish
Step 2-> and then OpenAI TTS for text to speech. 

Currently the end speech has an American accent. I am looking for a way to produce Indian accent speech output over Hinglish translation. 

Few things I tried - 
In the translation step, generated in devanagari script, in this case the accent was what I wanted, but the translation was very core Hindi.

Suggestions ?
[2023-12-05, 17:05:08] ~ Rushabh: instead of openai tts, try elevenlabs.io multilingua model
[2023-12-05, 17:05:17] ~ Rushabh: yes devanagari script also helps
[2023-12-05, 17:05:41] ~ kashish: Is there any tool that can take the entire GitHub repo and maybe Sonarqube analysis as input and suggest changes that can be accepted or rejected  to make the code quality of the repo better and resolve security vulnerabilities within code
[2023-12-05, 17:06:53] ~ Rushabh: @919087004481
[2023-12-05, 17:07:35] ~ kashish: We did a experiment using GPT3.5 API and it gives decent results but just checking to see if any open source tool already available
[2023-12-05, 17:07:52] Divyam Goel: Thx @918320575853, will try out elevenlabs once.
[2023-12-05, 17:07:55] ~ Rushabh: codeant.ai does it i guess
[2023-12-05, 17:10:22] ~ Rushabh: also checkout dubverse.ai, havent tried it yet but must be good. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-12-05, 22:32:22] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: https://neilpatel.com/blog/chat-gpt-bard-content/ TL;DR - Bard generally produces more unique content, with the study finding that 3x humans found Bard-generated articles preferable over ChatGPT.

Interesting observations:
- productivity boost usually appeared in the studies as a meaningful increase in speed of execution without a significant decrease in quality
- the willingness-to-pay for LLM-based tools is higher for people who have used the tools than those who have not, suggesting that the tools provide value above initial expectations

[2023-12-06, 17:21:36] ~ Sandeep: Alternately, if you'd like to develop a custom solution, SpecAugment helps improve noise robustness and improves WER performance as well (showed this earlier for Indian code-mixed speech: https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07130)
[2023-12-06, 17:22:04] Priyank Agrawal: Thats nicee thanks man!

[2023-12-06, 20:42:09] ~ Sushant: Hey Folks..

Trying to get more understanding of evaluation of RAG use cases.
So far I am looking at - 

RAGAS - https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas
DeepEval - https://github.com/confident-ai/deepeval
OpenAI Evals - https://github.com/openai/evals (this doesn't look like it's specific to RAG)

Apart from these, I have some custom rules made using very small dataset of manually created QnA.

is there something else apart from these that I should look at ?

Ideally I want to have a continues evaluation setup which can be run, when prompt change or data gets updated or even OpenAI has an updated Model.

Thanks.

[2023-12-06, 21:18:14] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Perhaps they ran out of free credits. 🤣🤣🤣 But on a more serious note,  perhaps they didn't even think it's worth. 

More likely though the release numbers are from before the openAI release ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-12-06, 21:18:57] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Would be unfair. They should only compare it with vanilla GPT-4(un-nerfed). If im not wrong, GPT-4 turbo is a tad bit quantized ‎<This message was edited>

A neat first-cut review on Gemini.

"Google DeepMind claims that Gemini outmatches GPT-4 on 30 out of 32 standard measures of performance. And yet the margins between them are thin"
[2023-12-06, 22:49:52] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: No no normal only
[2023-12-06, 22:53:01] Lucifer 😎: Though gemini outperformed gpt4 in all category - except 1 ( hella swag ), the difference is huge
87 for gemini ultra
93 for gpt4

Any reason for why the delta is so significant ?
[2023-12-06, 22:58:00] Lucifer 😎: https://x.com/rowancheung/status/1732416677890097416?t=aoMLQ7D_paON0EJGhN7UEA&s=09

Blown away w/ this demo
[2023-12-06, 23:07:44] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I need to test openhermes. @919892274454 mentioned it's beating the smaller models of Gemini
[2023-12-06, 23:21:12] Lucifer 😎: Looked at the demo a bit deeply and I have some query

1 - at the beginning, the model started explaining in real time what's happening when the guy started drawing lines / duck and colouring it - 
but later when the video progressed the model Waits for the person either to complete his sentence or set up whatever he is setting up on the table. 

Is this because there was a change in the system message prompt provided ? 

Is this because this entire demo is stitched from different examples into it 

It wasn't 1 shot take right
[2023-12-06, 23:26:10] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: It’s stitched together for sure
[2023-12-06, 23:29:52] Anubhav mishra Zupay: It's prompt only, the first part is more QnA and the rest are instructional. So I'm assuming it waits for a response of agreement or disagreement
[2023-12-06, 23:30:54] Lucifer 😎: Nonetheless, I was fairly impressed when the guy pointed his finger on the map and model could verify if that's right / wrong choice

That's damn Nlp + CV into picture

[2023-12-06, 23:45:14] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Summary of Gemini's 60-page technical report
via Chip 
https://twitter.com/chipro/status/1732458370404413704/

1. Written in Jax and trained using TPUs. The architecture, while not explained in details, seems similar to Flamigo's.

2. Gemini Pro's performance is similar to GPT-3.5 and Gemini Ultra is reported to be better than GPT-4. Nano-1 (1.8B params) and Nano-2 (3.25B params) are designed to run on-device.

3. 32K context length.

4. Very good at understanding vision and speech.

5. Coding ability: the big jump in HumanEval compared to GPT-4 (74.4% vs. 67%), if true, is awesome. However, the Natural2Code benchmark (no leakage on the Internet) shows a much smaller gap (74.9% vs. 73.9%).

6. On MMLU: using COT@32 (32 samples) to show that Gemini is better than GPT-4 seems forced. In 5-shot setting, GPT-4 is better (86.4% vs. 83.7%).

7. No information at all on the training data, other than they ensured "all data enrichment workers are paid at least a local living wage."

[2023-12-06, 23:48:04] Lucifer 😎: The thing is people will never trust any demo fully until they test it by their own hand

Corp wants their model to win, and they can go to any extent to make it transparent to the world that their architecture performs best ( even if they have to make some changes internally )
[2023-12-06, 23:48:13] Lucifer 😎: I might be wrong, but this is my take

[2023-12-07, 00:24:36] Dhruv Anand: Tried out Bard (not sure if it’s gemini). One deficiency that it shares with Perplexity is that it forgets the initial conversation while answering short follow-up questions or statements. ChatGPT on the other hand does terrific on this

Bard is getting its biggest upgrade yet with Gemini Pro

What: Starting today, we’re introducing Gemini Pro in Bard, for Bard’s biggest upgrade yet. We’ve specifically tuned Gemini Pro in Bard to be far more capable at things like understanding and summarizing, reasoning, coding, and planning. You can try out Bard with Gemini Pro for text-based prompts, with support for other modalities coming soon. It will be available in English in more than 170 countries and territories to start, and come to more languages and places, like Europe, in the near future." ‎<This message was edited>

One interesting step is Gemini generates a PRD as an intermediate planning step.

🫡
[2023-12-07, 01:38:37] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Even leaving the PRD aside ,this means Gemini will create customised UI to answer a user query

I am Darshan. I run a data consulting firm. We are based out of Mumbai. 

We are currently building an  application which provides semantic layer as a service to companies in the D2C sector.  

As a part of this application we are planing to introduce a data analyst co-pilot service which is a bot trained on D2C metrics and business fundamentals. 

We have started experimenting with langchain for now. But I wanted to figure if anyone has worked on a vertically integrated use case specific to any industry. 

Is there any merit in following this approach or a generic model can do the job as well.

[2023-12-07, 22:37:03] ~ Nj: Have used it to generate labels for training data rather than generate the whole training data. Accuracy is better than mturk from preliminary investigations
[2023-12-07, 22:39:53] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: So I need to actually generate training data. But how did u generate these labels ? Like how did ur prompt work - was it few shot ? 
How many labels did u have and how many few shot examples ..trying to get an idea of what I have to shoot for

[2023-12-07, 22:42:26] ~ Sandeep: I haven't yet as conventional synthetic data augmentation worked for our use case (document ai), but I don't see why you can't get good results with GPT generated data. Would still need to have HIL to maintain data quality though...
[2023-12-07, 22:42:38] ~ Nj: So the prompt contains the business knowledge like if this scenario happens do this. Then used few shots to add some reasoning steps so it works in tricky cases as well as structure the output
[2023-12-07, 22:44:28] ~ Nj: It was boolean prediction. If you give me some info about the kind of data you want to work with maybe I can help with more specific insights

[2023-12-08, 07:36:09] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: You have to put your api key there and there are so many templates in the repo based on what you want to generate 
I feel a large portion of the play is writing good prompts and validating if data you receive is good enough, first one is trial and error, second one is usually sent to a better model to validate, unless a human does it manually

APIs or libraries that can be setup quickly for a test ?
[2023-12-08, 12:14:34] Divyam Goel: ->Whisper translation api might out of the box for this. Should be worth checking out.

[2023-12-08, 14:44:47] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Good luck building deterministic software over unpredictable model behaviour 

And even better luck needed to test prompt performance because custom GPTs like Grimoire are able to follow through with complete code output.Which means tweaking prompts should yield results.
[2023-12-08, 14:47:35] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: How are enterprise solutions working to address this? Wouldn’t there be redundant effort each time there are any updates ?
[2023-12-08, 15:35:18] Dilip Ittyera CogniSwitch Founder: One of the methods that is working is to combine embeddings/vector db with Knowledge Graphs and rules/logic in a fusion RAG approach where the deterministic nature of the KG works as a reliable source of truth and guardrail
[2023-12-08, 15:38:20] Saurabh Karn Nyai: The data layer and the skill layer (fine tuning) are separate in application. Also, we are looking at much smaller models, size of 1b parameter for fine tuning over more static data that doesn’t change too frequently.

This could redefine efficiency standards for foundation models not just in language processing but across diverse modalities such as audio and genomics, where Mamba has proven effective. Or it could end up in development hell with most of the other architectures that have tried to dethrone Transformers within the last 12 months

[2023-12-09, 17:04:19] Lucifer 😎: Good Eve folks, 
quick 2 questions 

1 - How do you decide that given a new custom data [ let say ~1M docs ] and now when you query it from your v-Db, how do you select `top_k` during the retriever part ? 
-- Is it hit and trial method, or are there are quantitative steps to come up with a PROPER TOP_K value 

2 - How do you evaluate the retrieved chunks spit out from v-DB, for a moment please forget about RAGAS libs, any other vanilla method [ Similarity ? will this work on chunks which has ~1000 tokens ] 

Thanks
[2023-12-09, 17:04:51] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yep. With this amount of crowd you are bound to have some great talent pools
[2023-12-09, 17:05:32] Nirant K: On 2, let GPT4 evaluate relevance to the question?
[2023-12-09, 17:06:39] Nirant K: On 1, grid search for top K works well. Langchain Auto Evaluator and Llama Index both use that. It's a precision to recall tradeoff. How you measure those, is left as an exercise to reader.
[2023-12-09, 17:10:46] Lucifer 😎: Is using an additional LLM just to evaluate how good was my chunk an efficient method ? 

If I am on a tight budget and cannot afford to use any other LLM's apart from [ Generation part ], this will not be accepted. 

Will ROGUE SCORE, BLUE SCORE help in this picture ? ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-12-09, 17:12:34] Dilip Ittyera CogniSwitch Founder: Maybe you should consider creating a knowledge graph out of your docs
[2023-12-09, 17:13:27] Dilip Ittyera CogniSwitch Founder: You can do an automated one time job of the heavy lifting using a capable LLM among other things ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-12-09, 17:14:51] Lucifer 😎: Assuming I do create a KG using Neo4j, and have all the nodes and relationships in part

How will I but know, that the retrived query info from my KG does have answer to the user query ?
[2023-12-09, 17:15:02] Lucifer 😎: Isn't this just a workaround solution to V-DB ?
[2023-12-09, 17:17:03] Dilip Ittyera CogniSwitch Founder: You use a vdb to create the semantic spread even for traversing the graph. And still if you don’t get the necessary facts or knowledge pieces to respond then the context is insufficient I guess
[2023-12-09, 17:18:27] Dilip Ittyera CogniSwitch Founder: Additionally logic/rules could help with some reasoning too to respond if feasible
[2023-12-09, 17:20:26] Lucifer 😎: Nah, I mean - I get your point. 
My ask is : even if my KG / V-DB spits out chunks for a user query based on any indexing algorithm, selection of *top_k* is the one which the user decides. 

If that's right, are there any *optimization algorithm* which can help me choose that top_K 


like in k-means, we use silhouette to select *k* or Elbow method to select *k*

I need the same mapping, but in V-DB context
[2023-12-09, 17:21:28] Lucifer 😎: Anyone please share resources if you get one, thanks 
and thanks @919822381281 , will read more on KG

[2023-12-09, 17:39:43] Lucifer 😎: Hmm, I am getting a small gist of this. I will check this 

maybe precision@k or ndcg@k + some other approaches can help me better decide the top_K


How do you guys chose top_k ? Do you default to 3 or 10 or 5, or like any idea ?
[2023-12-09, 17:42:17] Nirant K: I mostly do MRR and Recall @ top K
[2023-12-09, 17:44:41] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Have a threshold score for the chunks below which you don't take any top k
[2023-12-09, 17:45:54] Lucifer 😎: then, I am afraid the question will shift to ' how do you decide that threshold ' ? 

Is it
- Domain expertise knowledge
- Multiple iterations and checking out which thresh cutoff generally edges over the correct ans without any FP slipping inside my retrived chunks
[2023-12-09, 17:46:23] Lucifer 😎: These are good ranking metrics. MRR, never heard of it. Will check this too. Thanks
[2023-12-09, 17:46:24] Nirant K: This works sometimes, but largely, cosine sim thresholding becomes another Param to tune.
[2023-12-09, 17:47:11] Lucifer 😎: Yes
[2023-12-09, 17:47:56] Lucifer 😎: I have no issues in deciding which ranking metrics to use / indexing algo to use

I have doubt on how many chunks to spit out

More chunks retrived, context issues mighr arise, less chunks retrived, no answers maybe present
[2023-12-09, 17:48:16] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: You will get an idea based on benchmarking over a few examples. You can then apply other stuff on top of it
[2023-12-09, 17:49:14] Lucifer 😎: Cool, thanks
right now, it's a very general open-ended domain of pdf's and not very specific

will do some testing on maybe medical QA or Trading QA to get some gist
[2023-12-09, 17:49:34] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: You can't anyways trust the response completely from a vector db. You will need to spit out more chunks and apply a reranking layer with a threshold anyways

[2023-12-10, 12:57:57] Shikhil Kumar Gupta: Does anyone know good courses or programs(even paid) that help individuals to accelerate journey in AI/ML. I got lots of queries on LinkedIn related to this. So asking folks here.
[2023-12-10, 13:01:17] ~ Deepesh: ‎This message was deleted.
[2023-12-10, 13:02:00] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: It is hard to use structured tech ed programs in AI today in real world projects. Things have become very subjective and fast moving. Most courses teach obsolete knowledge and self-directed learning seems to work better for most people. It is a time of crazy fast change, most practitioners including myself are barely able to keep pace. I took a course on AI/ML in 2019/20 (masters' level) and it taught me skills which were obsolete by 2021.

[2023-12-10, 15:35:35] Arvind N Generative AI Group: For people who fine tune open source LLMs often, is axolotl the go-to tool? With all the YAML knobs getting flipped on and off, how are you folks keeping up with the pace and tribal knowledge?
[2023-12-10, 15:44:08] Ravi Theja: @919616406460 want to comment here?
[2023-12-10, 15:48:44] Arvind N Generative AI Group: Thank you Ravi
[2023-12-10, 15:54:31] Abhishek Mishra: If it's something stable - axolotl
[2023-12-10, 15:54:56] Abhishek Mishra: If it's something that dropped recently or not popular with the community - my own wrapper over SFTTrainer
[2023-12-10, 15:55:28] Abhishek Mishra: Axolotl offers certain benefits that are hard to pass, especially the training speed ups because of sample packing
[2023-12-10, 15:55:43] Abhishek Mishra: Can cut down fine tune times by 40-60% easily
[2023-12-10, 15:58:11] Abhishek Mishra: I wrote this long back. At that time FA2 wasn't everywhere. The first 3 points still stand
[2023-12-10, 16:17:57] Arvind N Generative AI Group: This is fantastic. So for mistral 7B, the axolotl/examples/mistral/*.yml would be your approach, am I right?
[2023-12-10, 16:22:45] Abhishek Mishra: yes you can edit the configs. 95% of value is dataset anyway. You want everything else to just get out of the way for you.
[2023-12-10, 16:22:49] Sumba: Hey what's the consensus/reviews on the mistral mixture of experts? Any good blog on it?
[2023-12-10, 16:24:11] Abhishek Mishra: Not enough data to speculate much but it seems to be trade off with MoE inference difficulties vs having ability to genuinely build a >3.5 model
[2023-12-10, 16:24:47] Abhishek Mishra: Ignore what most people say about existing fine tunes replacing gpt 3.5 because 3.5 is more than just formatting/replacing stuff
[2023-12-10, 16:25:12] Abhishek Mishra: It has much higher reasoning and coding abilities then most generic fine tunes
[2023-12-10, 16:25:50] Abhishek Mishra: We already have OSS dedicated coder ~= 3.5 and OSS generic FTs ~=3.5 separately. But nothing all in one package.
[2023-12-10, 16:26:01] Arvind N Generative AI Group: Right. I am putting together a guide for people who can spend like $20 and get their own high performance LLM for targeted use cases. From what I have seen over a period of the last 5 months, the cost of reproduction of alpaca has dropped to like $5. There is a massive opportunity but with all the info flying around, it's hard for Devs to adopt best practices. Hence the guide. 
Thanks again.
[2023-12-10, 16:26:46] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This is amazing would love this asap. Thanks
[2023-12-10, 16:27:26] Abhishek Mishra: There's a guide published every week actually. 

And every week people love it.

That's the thing, all tutorial info comes in weekly and gets lost.
[2023-12-10, 16:27:42] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: @919811266476 already offers Qblock finetuner. You can easily tune a model for <$20 and also deploy it
[2023-12-10, 16:33:47] Arvind N Generative AI Group: 💯
I spent 2 decades in corporate America and every CTO I speak with is scratching their heads. I'm making a super noob guide for them to get started. The focus is going to be more on data prep as opposed to the SFT cfg. Hence the axolotl questions. The fast.ai approach to have great defaults is going to help a lot here imo.
[2023-12-10, 16:35:52] Abhishek Mishra: This is a good reference - https://medium.com/@geronimo7/finetuning-llama2-mistral-945f9c200611

I normally recommend to start with this for people.
Contains some good beginner ideas.
[2023-12-10, 16:36:33] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: This is super useful. Thanks!
What about input data formats ? Like I think the fine-tuning dataset needed for Llama2 is a different format than for got3.5 fine-tuning right ? 
Does axolotl (or any other tool) help create these datasets ?
[2023-12-10, 16:36:42] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Fair. What sticks sticks kinda approach here.
[2023-12-10, 16:36:56] Abhishek Mishra: Everything can be fine tuned on every format as long as it's a base model
[2023-12-10, 16:37:13] Abhishek Mishra: FT over FT model would need to follow same format as the previous instruction set
[2023-12-10, 16:37:25] Abhishek Mishra: Otherwise EOT or any custom token issues will arise
[2023-12-10, 16:37:40] Gaurav MonsterAPI Qblocks: Thanks for mentioning Aashay. Feel free to checkout our case study on finetuning mistral and benchmarking using our tuner:

[2023-12-10, 16:47:02] Varun Garg | KnitAI: Hi Gaurav! Are you seeing anything outperforming gpt-4 yet on specific tasks?
[2023-12-10, 16:53:25] Gaurav MonsterAPI Qblocks: Nothing yet. We are planning to do some deeper experiments with zephyr 7b beta and would also might explore qwen 72b. Dataset quality matters as well. No robots seem to be pretty good in that case but still might be limited in quality.
[2023-12-10, 17:34:38] Gaurav Shekhar: I am looking to create a logo and brand and struggling with prompts to make gpt look simpler, tried ms designer too. Any other alternatives?

[2023-12-10, 22:14:53] Abhishek Mishra: Everything he has created is OSS.
[2023-12-10, 22:17:09] Abhishek Mishra: Is this repo ready for usage though? He didn't announce anything from his account yet.
[2023-12-10, 22:18:53] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: no ig. its not clear what it exactly is
[2023-12-10, 22:20:33] Abhishek Mishra: It's similar to my own work autoInstruct. It's supposed to be useful for dataset curation for SFT and DPO.
[2023-12-10, 22:21:32] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: its like a collation of open datasets hes using to fine tune sft and dpo mistral
[2023-12-10, 22:21:53] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: probably another sota mistral 7b fine tune but this ones completely open
[2023-12-10, 22:22:11] Shikhil Kumar Gupta: Folks, How can I deploy and fine tune any smallest model like llama on my Mac machine? Can we even do it on local machine?

Can somebody please share a guide on this? It is mostly for learning purposes.
[2023-12-10, 22:22:45] Abhishek Mishra: You can try ollama and use the generic best models available there
[2023-12-10, 22:23:10] Abhishek Mishra: Most likely you don't need to FT unless you've a very specific case.
[2023-12-10, 22:24:11] Shikhil Kumar Gupta: I want to deploy it first on my 16GB Mac machine . I don't have a heavy machine as of now.

[2023-12-10, 22:36:34] Chetanya Rastogi: Ollama and lmstudio are 2 options to run models locally (quantized versions). NousResearch also showcased an app last week which they will be dropping soon after beta testing (windows/Linux/Mac and in fact Android too it seems)
[2023-12-10, 22:40:55] Abhishek Mishra: No
[2023-12-10, 22:41:05] Abhishek Mishra: Openhermes is ironically not open dataset
[2023-12-10, 22:41:27] Abhishek Mishra: Tek has mentioned that he might open it up later.
[2023-12-10, 22:44:04] Adithya S K PESIT: does axolotl also support DPO style datasets and training?
[2023-12-10, 22:59:56] Abhishek Mishra: Caseus is working to smoothen out the process
[2023-12-10, 23:02:52] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I think keeping dataset private is way to run a startup, as he is build one. It’s like the secret sauce that separate models apart and  independent model eval orgs that provide ratings.
[2023-12-10, 23:04:09] Adithya S K PESIT: So, can expect something soon
Also, what are the key differences between using Transformers/TRL and Axolotl? Axolotl also uses transformers and peft under the hood if I am not wrong.
[2023-12-10, 23:13:44] Lucifer 😎: Also apart from PPO Reward model in TRL, do they also support other RL algorithms ?
[2023-12-10, 23:15:55] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: yup. axolotl is a wrapper around hf trainer but makes it wayy more convenient given the yaml config setup.
[2023-12-10, 23:18:15] Abhishek Mishra: Wrapper over HF trainer but with extra features
[2023-12-10, 23:18:40] Abhishek Mishra: TRL supports PPO, DPO, IPO as of yet
[2023-12-10, 23:19:22] Abhishek Mishra: Plan for supporting rankwise preference for DPO is underway
[2023-12-10, 23:20:17] Adithya S K PESIT: do you guys think an UI based approach instead of yaml will help in the finetuning process
[2023-12-10, 23:21:16] Lucifer 😎: Checkout stable baselines from hill
[2023-12-10, 23:21:21] Lucifer 😎: They support far more than TRL,

@919616406460 indicated that it can also do some instruction following because of instruction data leak into training

[2023-12-11, 10:13:03] ~ Anantharam: I have tried similar and gave up. 3 problems 
1. Was never able to create a logo that I wanted. More so, no way to modify an image that is already generated by prompting on it more. While multi-modal works it doesn’t seem to work so well. 
2. ⁠The logo was generated as png. But to truly work with it for a brand we need an svg. No straightforward way to do it. 
3. ⁠Colors. Brand has some Colors and the logo should be in that pattern. Even after specifying color palette on the prompt the Colors are not of what we want. Post generation, changing Colors with high quality is a nightmare.
[2023-12-11, 11:07:16] Abhishek Mishra: Possibly relevant to people who were interested in Automated theorom proving.

[2023-12-11, 19:12:26] Arvind N Generative AI Group: Ok. HF has updated transformers a few minutes ago. Now there is some clarity.
If you set output_router_logits = True, you should be able to get the aux loss calculated automatically. If you want to add your own losses you should be able to import from the switch transformer and use the returned logits to compute it.

[2023-12-11, 22:54:45] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: The whole GPT-4 getting lazier thing started after they have moved to the GPT-4 Turbo model. I mainly use the playground instead of ChatGPT and the actual GPT-4 models don't have this problem.

[2023-12-12, 08:30:48] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Checkout the MMMU leaderboard
[2023-12-12, 09:19:43] Arvind N Generative AI Group: LLMs are all the hotbed of activity atm, but VLMs and other modalities sure are fast catching up.
The MMMU leaderboard sure did grab people's attention when Jeff Dean announced it along with the Gemini models. Personally, I feel it is unfair to compare a visual language model like InstructBLIP or Llava to an engineered system like GeminiU or GPT4V.
A more equivalent comparison would be with a system like ViperGPT that uses one of these VLMs as one of the core modules. I wrote a blog post about it recently.
[2023-12-12, 09:28:29] Anubhav mishra Zupay: The benchmarking is for expert AGI systems, viz a viz they expect the first such system to have expertise in multiple modalities.
[2023-12-12, 11:10:05] Nirant K: Haven't had a chance to run the notebook you shared.  You're right, the quantization is not 1-1 mapped to the original models with outdated/old Sentence Transformer models like MiniLM. 

We might deprecate these going forward since they're quite bad for retrieval and ranking

https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/blog/phi-2-the-surprising-power-of-small-language-models/
[2023-12-12, 22:29:04] Abhishek Maiti: dec.ai launched a 7B model (https://deci.ai/blog/introducing-DeciLM-7b-the-fastest-and-most-accurate-7b-large-language-model-to-date), does anyone know what is the base model they used? It says "Neural Architecture Search" and "variable grouped attention" but no information about the base model.
[2023-12-12, 22:32:59] Lucifer 😎: I might be wrong, but this is how my thinking is progressing

We all see everyday models being released, code, data etc from the proprietary and open source AI domain - all the smaller / medium sized models though are good - but not getting the rank  1 on benchmark datasets shows, is it worth training those models ?

If at the EOD, Mistral, OpenAI models and some high performing *double digit* Billion models are gonna win, why waste time in creating shorter single digit models ? 

Please enlighten me.
[2023-12-12, 22:34:44] ~ Bijon Guha: Been using copilot for a while. Had also used Blackbox sometime back, it was decent. But now on googling I am seeing lots of alternatives, so do try them and share your thoughts if possible
[2023-12-12, 22:36:17] Abhishek Mishra: looks like nobody uses codeium
[2023-12-12, 22:40:06] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: You can’t compare models with proprietary data or small domain specific models to benchmarks designed for general purpose model like GPT or Mistral. If you think that way, these general purpose mode are called “Base” model for a reason. No flavor, just base.
[2023-12-12, 22:46:34] Lucifer 😎: If these general purpose models are soo good at *lot of general tasks*, isn't it better to use only these models and fine tune on top of our specific usecases rather than *pre-training from the scratch* and only producing couple billion param models ?
[2023-12-12, 22:46:39] Lucifer 😎: I understand the pov here
[2023-12-12, 22:48:12] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Agree on not having a lot of new base models, tuning for specialized domain or task is the way to go IMO
[2023-12-12, 22:50:40] Lucifer 😎: But at retrospect, there might be cases where people / Researcher figure out lot of other alternatives to pre-train models 

Because until you don't pre-train a model, you will never realise that the idea which you had is actually worth it or not

Hence, these many models. Some shine and thrive, some just lie on the leaderboard left alone

It does reset when you ask the question and hit enter. 
But, it would be better if it gets reset at the beginning

Nonetheless, beautiful work team 🔥

[2023-12-13, 09:03:13] Vignesh Baskaran: Here are the notes from Sarvam's OpenHathi Series Launch. For people unfamiliar: Sarvam is an Indian startup focused on training Foundational LLMs for Indian languages. They launched OpenHathi series of model yesterday. Open Hathi is an attempt to add support of a new language to an existing open model such as LLama2 or Mistral. 

1. Here is a detailed technical blog on how the base model and the finetuned models were trained: https://www.sarvam.ai/blog/announcing-openhathi-series. The key advantages include:
-- *Efficient Tokenizer* in comparison to GPT and LLama Tokenizer. Nearly 3x to 4x reduction in tokenization hence extremely low inference cost!
-- *Pretained on Translation instead of Vanilla Continual Pretraining* -  The Base model has been pretrained on two translation tasks instead of Vanilla CPT
-- *Open Weights for the Base Pretrained Model*: https://huggingface.co/sarvamai/OpenHathi-7B-Hi-v0.1-Base.  This is a base model and not meant to be used as is. Please first finetuning it on task(s) you are interested in. 
-- *Supervised Finetuning* -  The base model has been supervised finetuned on translation, toxicity classification, text simplification, write-in-English-then-in-Hindi etc.
-- *Finetuned models* on Kissan and Koo datasets
-- Trained on Romanised Hindi and not just Pure Devanagiri Hindi
-- Proprietary Finetuned Models outperform GPT 3.5 and GPT 4 in a large number tasks
2. Here is a demo of the proprietary finetuned model by Prof. @919742053053 : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WKfVzJSDAd8
-- Generation with an efficient tokenizer
-- Think-in-English, Answer-in-Hindi
-- Cross Lingual RAG
-- Simplified translation
-- Romanized text translation
 3. Dhenu 1.0 - First LLM for farmers by collaboration of Kissan AI and Sarvam AI : https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-hXubdVTQ0 @19377081307 demos the powerful capabilities

I thought that they did the same mistake again on phi-2

Sorry for the misunderstanding.
[2023-12-13, 10:21:22] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: My question was is there data leakage also on phi2. I'm naturally suspicious 😅

Very intresting insights into training of foundation models.

Is anyone on this group trying to train a foundation model?
[2023-12-13, 14:30:51] ~ Deepak: Hey Guys, looking for speech to text models that I can run locally on Android/iOS. Found this discussion useful https://github.com/openai/whisper/discussions/11, anything else I should look at?
[2023-12-13, 14:32:49] Chinmay Shah Arrowhead: you can look at whisper.cpp
[2023-12-13, 14:36:22] Vignesh Baskaran: Have been only finetuning until now. Would love to train an FM. If you are putting together a group of individuals interested in training an FM, would love to join as well. Would be happy to run it on our AWS :) BTW AFAIK OpenHathi did not start from scratch. They have Continually pretrained on LLama 7B with MT datasets.
‎[2023-12-13, 14:40:00] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: ‎image omitted
[2023-12-13, 14:44:35] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: Training smaller models remains an active way to innovate on LLMs (data and model architecture). It's all about achieving good performance from smaller models rather than obtaining SOTA performance. The inference cost will be significantly lower for smaller models.

Considering the inference cost of fine-tuned LLMs, it's better to fine-tune smaller LLMs like Phi 2 or Llama 2 7B to achieve high performance rather than fine-tuning gpt-3.5-turbo.

Having good small LLMs/SLMs is preferable. IMO, there should be a new leaderboard based on performance and LLM size.
[2023-12-13, 14:46:35] Lucifer 😎: 👍 right.
[2023-12-13, 15:33:32] Rakeshkumar Waghela: I liked the way products are named.

Hathi with so called infinite memory and dhenu that generally relates to kaamdhenu , a cow that answers all the wishes.

Not just tech, product marketing too is India focused 👍

Another step forward
[2023-12-13, 23:21:12] C Chaitanya: We are trying. But we are trying with a completely different approach. No GPU based deep learning. We are doing step by step. Have been able to create sentence embedding representation and next word prediction upto 10 context length. Still a long way to go. This is just for our own research and fun.

[2023-12-14, 15:51:04] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: I also have another question -> when running on google collab (free version) . Can i use it to calculate ballpark latency for a model. I mean if a model is taking x amount of time to produce an output on T4 instance in google collab -> is there some correlation to how quick it can be on hosted gpu instances?
[2023-12-14, 15:51:49] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: what I mean to say is that is x a good ballpark number or there is no correlation between time it takes on google collab vs hosted gpu instances

I am testing SadTalker (https://github.com/OpenTalker/SadTalker) and am interested to understand the quality as well as the latency for video generation. I was testing on google collab -> but am not sure if the latency numbers i calculate there are any good and can give some ballpark idea about how would it run when i deploy it on a hosted gpu cluster

[2023-12-14, 21:38:05] ~ Rohan: I work in robotics and I have personally seen two use cases for edge computing / AI personal computer:
- Latency issues - it is impractical to run models in the cloud for real-time applications
- Change cost model - using edge (or any on prem) infra changes your operation's cost model from a variable cost model (more data processed => more costs) to a fixed cost model (more data processed => same cost). This can be very beneficial as your company scales and processes vast volumes of data.
Would love to hear other people's perspectives as well.
[2023-12-14, 21:52:16] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: What kind of use cases with large models are you looking at in robotics?
[2023-12-14, 22:58:53] ~ Rohan: Most robotics in production (including Boston Dynamics, self-driving, etc) still relies on classical control and planning algorithms, with ML models being used mostly on the perception stack (detection, tracking, segmentation, etc). The immediate use case for large models I'm working on is to accelerate this current setup. Mainly, to use large models (e.g., FAIR's SAM) to automate or improve labeling productivity. I've also used some generative algorithms to improve the fidelity of simulators so that they more closely resemble real-world conditions (mostly in terms of images).

Currently, there is a race in the research community to build a "foundational model for robotics". This means different things to different people. A good read on this is https://nishanthjkumar.com/Will-Scaling-Solve-Robotics-Perspectives-from-CoRL-2023/

Another promising direction is world models which help predict what happens in the world when you take a particular action. There are some startups working on this. It's an open question if it will work or not. If it does, it will dramatically advance robotics.

[2023-12-15, 13:47:21] ~ Sandeep: Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated tremendous capabilities in solving complex tasks, from quantitative reasoning to understanding natural language. However, LLMs sometimes suffer from confabulations (or hallucinations) which can result in them making plausible but incorrect statements [1,2]. This hinders the use of current large models in scientific discovery. Here we introduce FunSearch (short for searching in the function space), an evolutionary procedure based on pairing a pre-trained LLM with a systematic evaluator. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach to surpass the best known results in important problems, pushing the boundary of existing LLM-based approaches [3]. Applying FunSearch to a central problem in extremal combinatorics — the cap set problem — we discover new constructions of large cap sets going beyond the best known ones, both in finite dimensional and asymptotic cases. This represents the first discoveries made for established open problems using LLMs. We showcase the generality of FunSearch by applying it to an algorithmic problem, online bin packing, finding new heuristics that improve upon widely used baselines. In contrast to most computer search approaches, FunSearch searches for programs that describe how to solve a problem, rather than what the solution is. Beyond being an effective and scalable strategy, discovered programs tend to be more interpretable than raw solutions, enabling feedback loops between domain experts and FunSearch, and the deployment of such programs in real-world applications.

If call centres are using a call masking service like Ola does the calls are recorded .

Biggest call centre software providers like Ameyo,Exotel would have tons of voice data in almost all of the languages.

[2023-12-15, 16:59:43] Krishna Ntkris: Does the call centre own this data, or the client they are servicing?
[2023-12-15, 17:01:29] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Clients own it but there is also a retention policy.Beyond agreed retention period not sure if the ownership changes ,since clients typically lose access to the data.
[2023-12-15, 17:03:25] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Sorry in case there are 3 parties

[2023-12-16, 14:54:15] ~ Soham: What is the difference between RAG and Finetunning?
[2023-12-16, 15:06:36] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) and fine-tuning are two distinct approaches in the field of natural language processing and machine learning.

	1.	Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG):
	•	Combination of Retrieval and Generation: RAG combines a neural retrieval mechanism (like a search engine) with a sequence-to-sequence model (like a text generator). It first retrieves relevant documents or information from a large dataset and then uses this information to generate a response.
	•	Real-time Information Access: The retrieval step allows the model to pull in up-to-date or specific information that it was not trained on, making it suitable for tasks where external knowledge or recent data is crucial.
	•	Dynamic Content Integration: It can dynamically integrate content that was not in the training data, making it flexible and adaptable to new topics or information.
	2.	Fine-Tuning:
	•	Customizing Pre-Trained Models: Fine-tuning involves taking a pre-trained model and further training it on a smaller, more specific dataset. This process adapts the model to the particularities of a new task or domain.
	•	Targeted Learning: By fine-tuning on a specific dataset, the model becomes more proficient in the language, style, and content of that dataset, which enhances its performance on similar types of data or tasks.
	•	Limited by Training Data: Unlike RAG, fine-tuned models are limited to the knowledge contained in their training data. They don’t have the capability to pull in external information dynamically.

[2023-12-16, 15:25:24] Abhishek Mishra: It's still RLHF, it just doesn't need a reward model. Because a language model can act as it's own reward model.

And this is also a bit outdated because now we have KTO, we don't even need preference data now :)
[2023-12-16, 15:28:24] Abhishek Mishra: You can take CulturaX, which has lots of Indic language data.

Though it's not exactly usable license but I don't see anybody probing about that either.

[2023-12-16, 16:08:57] Vignesh Baskaran: KTO is invented by Contextual AI.  By studying the work of economists Kahneman & Tversky on human decision-making, they’ve designed an *alignment method* that does not require preferences like ‘Output A trumps output B for input X’. Instead, for an input X, we simply need to know whether an output Y is desirable or undesirable. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-12-16, 20:17:24] Lucifer 😎: Good Eve folks
Has anyone dwelled deeper into RAG with KG, rather than vanilla V-DB

I'd love to learn more on how entity is extracted and relationships are made. Not just the brief or using any frameworks, but are there any technical blogs / transcripts which teaches the methodology for the same

Thanks
[2023-12-16, 20:18:39] Lucifer 😎: I've built good KG using Neo4j and queried it with Cypher but never knew the intricacies of it 

This is the time
[2023-12-16, 20:24:02] Ravi Theja: what's the use-case RAG with KG you are looking into? any specific reason why you want to explore RAG with KG approach rather than usual VDB approach?
[2023-12-16, 20:26:30] Lucifer 😎: Yes. 
I've read from some sources that RAG + VDB, Sometimes gives incorrect chunks as retrived output ( though they can be filtered out using re ranker )

Secondly, KG makes more sense in the field of Medical Domain, where based on Symptoms and Personal information, you can check for future diagnosis and also checkout for other information

Cause KG is build using Entities and Relationships
[2023-12-16, 20:26:56] Lucifer 😎: Also, it will be a good learning to me, and would probably plan to build atleast 2 good E2E projects on it
[2023-12-16, 20:27:04] ~ Jaswanth: One issue I face is when entities are involved
[2023-12-16, 20:27:23] Lucifer 😎: That you have to have exact matching with your query
[2023-12-16, 20:27:29] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: U have to basically generate cypher queries. It's quite powerful since u can traverse graph of related entities and get a much better context for RAG.
But ull have to work with codegen
[2023-12-16, 20:28:03] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: It's actually much better than a plain vector fetch since u can have a fairly complex graph of entity relationships.
Very pagerank like
[2023-12-16, 20:28:10] Lucifer 😎: I've worked with Neo4j queries for approx 4-5 months. Hence I'd definitely pick it up fast

But there is more to see than meet the eyes.
[2023-12-16, 20:28:32] Lucifer 😎: Please do share some good resources if you find one

Or anyone to the matter.
[2023-12-16, 20:28:47] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: It's not u picking up. It's about generating those queries by your prompt in response to a question
[2023-12-16, 20:29:30] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: There's not any resources here. Ull have to kind of hand craft it. Since it is very closely tied to how u build ur graph.

Unlike a vector db, the methodology is not standardized
[2023-12-16, 20:42:23] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: I've done something similar where I use a KG for associating chunks but also use vdb
[2023-12-16, 20:42:56] Lucifer 😎: Oh nice. That's a hybrid RAG kinda thing
Can you enlighten more on this
[2023-12-16, 20:43:10] Lucifer 😎: Fair enough. 
I'll be working on this and will share resources on the fly
[2023-12-16, 20:43:10] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: First vdb to find a relevant chunk and then KG for associated meta data / associated chunk and other related info
[2023-12-16, 20:43:52] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: The graph is not very deep, you can think of it as a ring with each node having a few leaves. Max depth 3
[2023-12-16, 20:44:08] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: Does that make sense ?
[2023-12-16, 20:57:22] Lucifer 😎: I mean, I can understand the gist of it - but until I go in depth, I will never understand how chunks from V-Db is used in KG
I'll learn more about it before addressing your POV, thank you for the input
[2023-12-16, 21:26:06] Gaurav Shekhar: Hey folks likely you’ve discussed this but is there a UI out there that can accept a transcript of a 1 hour + video and help with summarizations?
[2023-12-16, 21:27:22] Lucifer 😎: A small query - calculating semantic similarity

sent1 = "I like apple but not mango"
sent2 = "I like mango but not apple"

when I am using sentence transformer to get sentence embeddings which also takes into consideration the semantic / context into meaning - the score which I get is kinda confusing

Model used - 'all-MiniLM-L6-v2'
util.cos_sim(s1_em, s2_em)  >> tensor([[0.9864]])

Any idea what's going on ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-12-17, 11:01:34] Rahul Deora: Hey guys I am want to add knowledge to an LLM by fine tuning it on my own unstructured data(text books of some domain). I have found a lot of code for doing SFT using Q&A format but not for doing pretraining on raw data for Llama 2. 

Can someone please suggest me how I can do this pretraining for Llama 2 or any other open LLM?
[2023-12-17, 11:21:18] Sachin Legaltech: The default setting of trl/sft_trainer is to train on the entire text sequence (https://huggingface.co/docs/trl/sft_trainer) . You will need to convert your textbooks in the dataset format by making chunks of text on which you want to train. I believe for continuous pretraining you might want higher learning rate. I think @919616406460 have done this and can give more tips.
[2023-12-17, 12:07:05] Abhishek Mishra: Ideally for continued pretraining we want to have the details on how the model was trained and what was the final learning rate and choice of optimiser, scheduler etc.
[2023-12-17, 12:07:21] Abhishek Mishra: This way, we just take our data and do a resume pretraining thing
[2023-12-17, 12:08:15] Abhishek Mishra: It picks up from same lr, same scheduler, same optimiser and can learn better. In absence of it, we have to go with a usual guess of what could've been the strategy. And choose lr accordingly.
[2023-12-17, 12:09:24] Abhishek Mishra: Btw, continued pretraining can be very costly and still lead to lots of hallucinations
[2023-12-17, 12:09:58] Abhishek Mishra: So probably best to build a very good RAG system for using knowledge and interface with function calls or something in case you want to interface with coding documentation
[2023-12-17, 12:12:43] Rahul Deora: For continual deep question answering, I don’t think RAG is very good
[2023-12-17, 12:12:45] Rahul Deora: So if I want to train on medical textbooks for a doctor or students
[2023-12-17, 12:12:46] Rahul Deora: Then RAG will not provide the required knowledge resolution
[2023-12-17, 12:13:02] Dilip Ittyera CogniSwitch Founder: You can try using the KG toolspec options in LlamaIndex
[2023-12-17, 12:14:02] Rahul Deora: I will eventually combine the LLM with RAG, but I need it to by default have a deep understanding of the subject for an expert or student to question and answer on
[2023-12-17, 12:14:14] Dilip Ittyera CogniSwitch Founder: And maybe not the reliability
[2023-12-17, 12:14:24] Nirant K: Continual pretraining won't either imho
[2023-12-17, 12:15:01] Rahul Deora: It may not, but I see it as the best option currently
[2023-12-17, 12:15:29] Nirant K: The best option is perhaps to wait 3 months and let someone make a base model for the domain of your choice
[2023-12-17, 12:15:48] Nirant K: And have evals ready to fire when that happens for your tasks ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-12-17, 12:18:19] Rahul Deora: Why do you think pretraining with a bunch of textbooks will not help? I ask chatgpt about certain topics and it can answer in detail about them

[2023-12-17, 12:19:58] Nirant K: If you're aiming for ChatGPT, how many experts does your mixture have? How do you know that ChatGPT doesn't use RAG?
[2023-12-17, 12:22:00] Rahul Deora: Currently no experts cause I’ve been looking into Llama 2 😄, but starting to look into Mistral now cause can’t find Llama 2 pretraining code
[2023-12-17, 12:22:40] Rahul Deora: Maybe cause of the speed? It’s knowledge base is too huge for RAG I assume

*Notes on discussion between Sebastian Bubeck, creator of Phi and MSFT CTO Kevin Scott - 12 minute video*
- What are the minimal ingredients required to spark intelligence which are present in large models such as GPT-4?
- They are group of theoreticians with no practical experience in training LLMs. So they started training a code generator because of the well defined structure of the data which is Phi-1
- The main takeaway of Textbooks are all you need paper is that quality of the data matters even more than what we thought earlier
- Textbooks are all you need is not about training models on real textbooks. Instead it is about creating synthetic text books using GPT-4 and then training your models based on it. When you have such synthetic text book quality data you are able to train much much smaller model. Phi-1 is 1B param model
- While Phi 1 was about coding, Phi 1.5 is about common sense reasoning ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-12-18, 19:08:31] ~ Apurva Bhatt: it happens when a user expects model to generate results on which it is not trained. LLMs have good general sense, as long as one wants that they are good. If one expects them to behave differently (most on data on which they are not trained) they start messing up.
[2023-12-18, 19:14:13] Divya Tak: I see
[2023-12-18, 19:36:49] Vrushank Vyas: Langchain hub is laterally useful for this - see the use case, it’s usefulness etc.

Promptlayer as well
[2023-12-18, 20:57:30] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: Just curious to hear what tools you came across for prompt saving?

[2023-12-18, 22:51:26] Shimanta Generative AI: Has anyone worked on text classification/categorisation with LLMs? 
I am working on a small project where I have come across this problem.
I have tried with just sending the text list in the context and some prompt engineering but it doesn’t fare well since the text in the list are 3-4 words max.
Another approach I am thinking of is using multi agent approach, where one agent first determines categories from the list, and the second then determines which text falls into which of these categories.
My problem with this approach is that it might be slow.
Please chip in if anyone has any guides on how to best approach this problem.
[2023-12-18, 23:00:11] Shashwat TDC: looks like you are doing zero-shot. Tried giving examples in your approach #1
[2023-12-18, 23:02:12] Shimanta Generative AI: Thanks! Is there any other way apart from this that you can think of?
[2023-12-18, 23:11:16] Shashwat TDC: you can perhaps do majority voting - from 3 different models making parallel API calls. This will be slower than approach #1 but it will not be 3x
[2023-12-18, 23:32:21] Shan: If it’s just 3-4 words, can a human do it and how much accuracy? If a human can, then I suggest you try prompt engineering with some exemplars etc and it should work to a fair degree. Those which don’t work, add them as exemplars again. You have 8k prompt length you will fit in a lot of exemplars.
[2023-12-18, 23:37:06] Shashwat TDC: hey guys, want to exchange notes with anyone who have attempted to fine-tuned SD model on proprietary data. Pls DM ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-12-18, 23:45:07] Shimanta Generative AI: Will this approach work well even if not all the data that comes in fit in the categories provided as examples?
[2023-12-19, 06:29:25] Vinayak Tantia FAIR Researcher: You can add another category called “None of these”. Do remember to add some examples for that as well

https://twitter.com/abacaj/status/1736819789841281372

I fear anyone building/training on Internet after 2022 is going to have this problem in very weird ways — including Gemini and MistralAI
[2023-12-19, 09:34:24] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Wow AI responds to AI emotional stimulus 🤣
[2023-12-19, 09:34:48] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: On a lighter note this sounds like dealing with someone with low confidence where you have to tell them they're awesome to get something out of them
[2023-12-19, 09:34:54] Priyank Agrawal: What is posining?

Training on the eval data? Or training on output of existing LLM?
[2023-12-19, 09:37:47] Nirant K: Reminds me of the idea of "Low background steel" (https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Low-background_steel) — we'll have to use 2021 Internet as the most usable corpus in coming years
[2023-12-19, 09:38:19] Nirant K: Here? It's poisoned by training on the output of an existing LLM on a related task at the very least e.g. coding — and possibly HumanEval itself.
[2023-12-19, 09:39:29] Nirant K: At this rate, would telling AI that you're Asian/Indian (AI) and work hard might work even better?
[2023-12-19, 09:40:51] Paras Chopra Wingify: lol, is it all alchemy
[2023-12-19, 09:41:26] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: So I have heard from someone without taking explicit names. 

That gaslighting the AI by playing the Indian race card actually makes it work better 🤣🤣🤣

[2023-12-19, 09:43:56] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: From what I remember it's more along the lines of, "oh you are unwilling to tell me that answer because I am Indian, are you discriminating against me ?" 🤣🤣🤣

[2023-12-19, 10:20:32] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dead_Internet_theory Even 2020 might not be good enough.
[2023-12-19, 10:30:29] ~ Amit Sharma: BERT might be better for text classification / categorization than LLMs, if you have a few hundred/thousand annotated samples.
[2023-12-19, 10:31:58] Vignesh Baskaran: Back in those good old days, I was training  SVMs and Random Forests! It was much more peaceful back then. I fundamentally understood these models extremely very well and was able to rationally improve the performance of these models. I don't understand with Prompt Engineering and LLMs how could one build something reliable. They are just fragile!
[2023-12-19, 10:33:45] Lucifer 😎: Tuning C parameter 😞
[2023-12-19, 10:36:09] Vignesh Baskaran: The wide spread adoption of Deep Learning happened for two reasons:
1. We did not have to do handcrafted feature engineering anymore
2. The performance of DL systems were much better

Similarly, we need a way to transition away from micro prompt engineering to something less handcrafty. For me prompt engineering today is similar to feature engineering in the old days
[2023-12-19, 10:45:48] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I miss those days when people actually thought through the problem instead of throwing the data into a linear algebra soup. Then again you could argue that we are thoughtful specifically about LLMs are researched and iterated upon. Not a very defensible position to hold that back in the days of 'data science' there was more thought put into modeling. I remember an old colleague who coolly used 2 sample tests for floating point proportion data and seemed happy enough about it
[2023-12-19, 10:47:33] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: The trend seems to be towards the development of meta-systems and meta-modes of interactions with computational systems through AI. Perhaps we should all be prepared to deal with even higher level abstractions.
[2023-12-19, 10:49:27] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Age old question - what level of abstraction is fundamentally useful from the point of view of usability and interpretability - for programmers from the 1970s, Perl may have looked exotic as gangly and spiked it looks to many of us Pythonistas, and future generations may deride that we even wrote prompts to LLMs
[2023-12-19, 10:52:54] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I don’t miss those days when I used to write NN in matlab 😂
[2023-12-19, 11:06:57] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: I felt this way too, Richard Suttons “The bitter lesson” opened my eyes on this a bit, and it has been proved right since he came up with this before the rise of LLMs. 
http://www.incompleteideas.net/IncIdeas/BitterLesson.html
[2023-12-19, 11:08:29] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: For me it's recursion depth 3. Beyond which stack overflow happens in my own head lol
[2023-12-19, 11:19:07] Rishabh Refuel.ai: Hey @919707948595 - we built an open source library for data labeling with LLMs: https://github.com/refuel-ai/autolabel

It should make it easy to try out different LLMs, and experiment with prompts, few shot strategies, etc. you can also try our LLM, that’s been fine tuned on a large number of classification tasks. 

If you don’t get the accuracy you want, let me know. Happy to chat more.
[2023-12-19, 11:20:05] Rishabh Refuel.ai: Good old days with sklearn’s grid search :)

[2023-12-19, 13:56:57] Lucifer 😎: FYI - Though langchain provides multiple ways to build chains and qa stuffs, I was kinda confused which one to use when
Blog - https://freedium.cfd/https://towardsdatascience.com/4-ways-of-question-answering-in-langchain-188c6707cc5a
this helped me to understand all the 4 with proper examples 

In summary, 
load_qa_chain - uses all texts and accepts multiple documents; 

RetrievalQA uses load_qa_chain under the hood but retrieves relevant text chunks first; 

VectorstoreIndexCreator is the same as RetrievalQA with a higher-level interface; 

ConversationalRetrievalChain is useful when you want to pass in your chat history to the model. ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-12-19, 14:16:35] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: Same here, some of our internal users wanted to generate scripts for shows which will contain love-making scenes, fight/gun sequences and it just doesn't cut it for any of that. Maybe the idea is that you sign-up for Enterprise version where such flags are relaxed.

[2023-12-19, 17:30:26] Rajaswa Patil: It has a tricky license. It’s not completely restricting commercial usage as there was some opposition from open source contributors. There is a discussion thread on the repo somewhere that clarifies what’s allowed and what’s not allowed a bit more directly.

Not sure how much it will hold legally though
[2023-12-19, 17:31:12] ~ prasanna kumar: i guess this is the thread 
https://github.com/huggingface/text-generation-inference/issues/726
[2023-12-19, 17:32:59] ~ prasanna kumar: To elaborate further:

If you are an existing user of TGI prior to v1.0, your current version is still Apache 2.0 and you can use it commercially without restrictions.

If you are using TGI for personal use or research purposes, the HFOIL 1.0 restrictions do not apply to you.

If you are using TGI for commercial purposes as part of an internal company project (that will not be sold to third parties as a hosted or managed service), the HFOIL 1.0 restrictions do not apply to you.

If you integrate TGI into a hosted or managed service that you sell to customers, then consider requesting a license to upgrade to v1.0 and later versions - you can email us at api-enterprise@huggingface.co with information about your service.
[2023-12-19, 17:34:18] Nihit (Yuuki): we followed the multi agent approach, but we would work with little more text. Maybe a sentence or 2.

So I wrote an API layer to access different functionalities of the app. Now i plan to build a basic UI for it. 
i was thinking of using django to do it but in all honesty i have never used django but i am well versed with python so i can use co-pilot + gpt + internet to do what i want to achieve but i would be interested to know if there are any other generative AI/non generative AI method that i can use to get this done quickly. Bonus points if it's also scalable. 
ps: from what i know the most scalable solution is to build it from scratch but any ideas or inspirations would be handy for sure.
Thanks a lot!

[2023-12-22, 16:44:30] Shan: What interests me the most is the reasoning capabilities of smaller LLMs eg orca and future directions there. What does fine tuning for reasoning look like? How would you evaluate outside of standard benchmarks etc
[2023-12-22, 16:45:34] Shan: On the lines of orca2
[2023-12-22, 16:55:29] Shan: Agree. I’ve never been a RAG fan. Although I don’t see any alternative either. GPT plus bing isn’t really awesome and bing is a massive store of memory that can be queried! (Which makes gpt + bing the largest RAG system in some ways) 

In the grand scheme of things, my point is that you can’t make a fourth grader do tenth grade physics by _only_ showing him physics textbooks.

[2023-12-23, 11:33:12] Ojasvi Yadav: If my audience is regional, they're conversing or generating content in their own scripts. OAI and most other LLM providers charge in terms of tokens you send and receive from their LLMs. If these messages/inputs/outputs are in regional scripts, they consume about 5-8x the amount of tokens for the same number of characters/words.

Since their pricing is in terms of tokens, communicating with their LLMs in regional scripts ends up being 5-8x more costly than if you were to communicate in English A-
[2023-12-23, 11:33:24] Ojasvi Yadav: So if I'm getting similar performance on Gemini and my users are regional, then Gemini ends up being 5-8x cheaper
[2023-12-23, 11:33:28] Ojasvi Yadav: Since Gemini doesn't charge based on tokens of the input/output messages but rather the number of characters of the input/output messages
[2023-12-23, 11:35:32] Ojasvi Yadav: True. I haven't tested Gemini but their per-character costing is extremely interesting for any non-latin scripts.
[2023-12-23, 11:37:43] Ojasvi Yadav: I would note that Google translate has been at the forefront of language translation for more than a decade
[2023-12-23, 11:38:15] Ojasvi Yadav: Can only imagine they made full use of that data to make Gemini as multilingual as possible
[2023-12-23, 11:39:14] Pratyush Choudhury: Elaborate a little bit here please?
[2023-12-23, 11:40:18] Ojasvi Yadav: I would parrot this
[2023-12-23, 11:41:32] Pratyush Choudhury: Very interesting, probably goes into the model routing logic if one is using >1 models in production
[2023-12-23, 11:45:43] Vrushank Vyas: do you mean picking up if the input is non-latin and then instead of calling openai, calling gemini?
[2023-12-23, 11:45:48] Kunal Bhatia Hexo: Assuming GPT is trained on larger & diverse datasets, it would have deeper knowledge compared to some of the indic models. 

Wouldn't a translation + OAI pipeline be a more suitable option if translation model costs are only marginal?

When we think about tech incumbents that could be severely disrupted by generative AI, Apple often tops the list. 

While Microsoft, Amazon, NVIDIA, Google, and even Meta have unveiled clear playbooks for their generative AI strategies, the Cupertino giant seems to have dangerously fallen behind in this space.

That might soon change though. 

In a somewhat surprising paper titled ‘LLM in a Flash: Efficient Large Language Model Inference with Limited Memory,’ Apple unveiled a new technique to run LLMs on devices with limited DRAM capacity. The cornerstone of this technique is the use of flash storage in mobile devices to store model parameters, loading them on-demand into DRAM. Apple’s method is hyper-optimized to minimize the volume of data transmitted from flash storage, while also transmitting the data in small, continuous chunks. The result allows for running models twice as large as the available DRAM, while also showing a 4.5x increase in inference speed on CPUs and 20-25x on GPUs, respectively. Quite impressive!

‘LLM in a Flash’ outlines a clear path for running sophisticated LLM models on iPhones and iPads, which seems like the natural vehicle for Apple to enter the generative AI space. Maybe we are about to see Apple GPT in the next iOS release after all.

[2023-12-24, 22:12:42] Lucifer 😎: You could probably take the OCR ( which has info of BBOX too ) of the docs which you are providing in your VDB

If that link redirects to the response answer which is in pdf ( Assuming : The answer will match keyword wise )

When you get the output from RAG, you can then just do a keyword match and find out the BBOX matching

Based on that, you can highlight the texts

[2023-12-26, 17:11:21] Nirant K: What does IaaS mean? AWS CDK kinda code?
[2023-12-26, 17:19:40] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Stumped here too. What test cases would we write for infra as a service?
[2023-12-26, 17:26:58] Abhiram Ravikumar GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: I've had some success with Terraform
ChatGPT and Aws Codewhisperer come up with tests for infra
[2023-12-26, 17:27:37] Abhiram Ravikumar GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: Clean deployment 
Clean destroy 
Just a few things like that ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-12-26, 17:30:12] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Do you mean infra as code, not IaaS? That looks like Terraform to me
[2023-12-26, 17:31:11] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: That’s something you may have to write a system for.  Perhaps generative AI could be used to run some shell scripts to check whether the appropriate resources are up or destroyed. That’s one kind of test case maybe
[2023-12-26, 17:32:05] Abhiram Ravikumar GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: Ah I misread it as IaaC
‎[2023-12-26, 17:59:16] ~ Prateek🖤: ‎image omitted
[2023-12-26, 18:01:35] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: IaaS means infrastructure as a solution
[2023-12-26, 18:02:27] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: Terraform is IAC-Infrastructure as a code in which Terraform is a tool that is used AWS uses it
[2023-12-26, 18:03:18] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: Would you really need GenAI for it just to run scrips
[2023-12-26, 18:06:07] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: It’s an overkill I meant
[2023-12-26, 18:25:49] ~ YP: Thing with terraform is that it's robust, which is a huge priority while working on these things and GenAI systems by their function are non deterministic
[2023-12-26, 18:29:00] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: Terraform is more of an IaC and you will have to write provider and will be used more at k8. I am looking more to write test case generation at IaaS
[2023-12-26, 19:46:54] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yes, agree with Shekar. Use case seems to be a force fit for using AI in general and Gen AI in particular
[2023-12-26, 19:47:31] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Terraform scripts could be scanned by tools like Github Copilot, and could help write and configure infra better. That is one possibility
[2023-12-26, 20:00:30] ~ Prateek🖤: Infra. As a service
[2023-12-26, 20:02:28] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: Sorry meant that
[2023-12-26, 20:03:51] ~ Prateek🖤: IaaS is a service offering as an umbrella term.

If you are talking about different components within your IaaS, then ofcourse you can use genAi to write test cases or even GitHub copilot in general.

All kinds of build checks
Job runs
Schema checks
Primary key/foreign key checks
Data refreshness checks
API quota limits checks

Etc etc

But all of this just as a starter template I would recommend.

You would need a dedicated devops engineer ( or team later ) to keep everything in check and avoid any fire 😂 when ur service is in PROD
[2023-12-26, 20:03:51] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yeah, Infra as a service is a common cloud engineering paradigm
[2023-12-26, 20:07:26] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yeah, at least at some level the use of generative AI with what may be deterministic systems in cloud infra doesn't seem to be a fit. I do think however that using NLP to provision a resource or two for development, and then run it past rules based checks is a viable use case for repeatable infra management. This takes away the YAML from Terraform and replaces it with just plain natural language.
[2023-12-26, 20:08:16] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: In theory - this paradigm has been called AIOps (as if we were not already confused by AI, ML, statistical learning, etc) esp in the context of telecommunications
[2023-12-26, 20:08:43] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Network function virtualization is one area of telecom where soemthing like this can be potentially useful
[2023-12-26, 20:09:27] ~ Prateek🖤: I agree 💯👍
[2023-12-26, 20:12:18] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I see diagramming tools doing AI these days and there is a diagramming tool out there (more than one I am sure) for software architecture diagramming. If only we had ( and this will now sound like an gauntlet on the ground) an app that could connect to a cloud backend and then build up the infra we draw in the architecture - that imperative style of dealing with infra could potentially simplify the whole devops lifecycle
[2023-12-26, 20:19:34] Sumba: so essentially from a draw.io system design to terraform yml files and state change
[2023-12-26, 20:20:23] Sumba: would be nice yea
[2023-12-26, 20:21:37] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yeah, have you checked our tldraw? They introduced a bunch of AI features recently and I think it is cool. Lucidchart is what a lot of us use but going from a pure play diagramming /visualization app to one that builds backend infra and pipelines is a big deal
[2023-12-26, 20:26:49] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: Perfect this is what I was thinking also bring in CI/CD will help me know where the code change meaning the repo and then trigger test cases applicable to what the code changed
[2023-12-26, 20:28:31] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: Yes now days very frequently used AIOPs
[2023-12-26, 20:29:23] Sumba: CI/CD for terraform changes is handled well by atlantis already

https://github.com/runatlantis/atlantis
[2023-12-26, 20:32:57] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: Yes but for running the right test cases for the changes is not handled from my understating

[2023-12-27, 13:40:15] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: does this work for non english languages esp indian languages - curious. has anyone tried with indian languages ?
[2023-12-27, 13:40:25] Nirant K: I've recommended Azure Document Recognizer for pdf extraction to multiple clients — healthcare, fintech, semiconductor — they've all been very happy with in. Little tedious to use since it's OP, but works better than almost everything else we tried for digital docs. 

For scanned things, AWS Textract is the best return on your (effort+cost)  ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-12-27, 13:41:27] Vetrivel PS: AWS Textract is not good for PDFs having multiple columns in a single page like Research papers, it reads the lines as a single line instead of continuity of text, this is just one of the few challenges we faced with AWS Textract
[2023-12-27, 13:42:02] Vetrivel PS: Never tried on Indian languages though

[2023-12-27, 13:48:09] ~ Krishna Iyengar: I have seen aws texttract work well with scanned documents like diagnostic reports. (There is tabular structure but no table as such printed). It recognized tables and gave parent/child and row/column metadata. However some post processing was required to sort out errors/confusion on row/column assignments
[2023-12-27, 13:48:46] ~ Krishna Iyengar: Haven't done a deep dive to compare various other services though
[2023-12-27, 13:49:58] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: yes had good experience with medical reports and extraction 2 years ago on this.
[2023-12-27, 13:51:24] ~ Uneet: +++ I have used it to parse complex US insurance forms, and it gave very good results
[2023-12-27, 13:54:25] ~ Siva: Similar one, any recommended library/document loader/approach to extract all the elements from a webpage, that extracts all the text, images along with metadata from all the tabs present in a webpage?
[2023-12-27, 13:56:12] ~ Amlan: Pypdf2 ... I recently used it for my customer
[2023-12-27, 14:06:15] Vetrivel PS: U can try to use web scrapping package like Beautiful Soup, Selenium or Scrapy to extract the content but this needs custom logic as the tags might differ for each and every URL
[2023-12-27, 14:07:03] Mohit YC W23: Did you try the layout detection flag ? It worked well for me for similar docs.
[2023-12-27, 14:07:27] ~ Tarun Narayanan: +++ 

Do not bother with Google's Document AI suite
[2023-12-27, 14:08:05] Mohit YC W23: If someone could build a way to fine tune layoutlmv3 with data from azure doc or aws textract it would be 🔥
[2023-12-27, 14:08:18] ~ Siva: True...Since there are different elements, trying with a custom logic and like to know is there any universal approach/library
[2023-12-27, 14:08:40] Vetrivel PS: I think we were using Azure Document Recogniser as a benchmark to say if the Open Source methods are good or not 😀
[2023-12-27, 14:10:54] Vetrivel PS: +1

Wish to know if there is anything universal for this.

Currently working on a usecase to extract content from URL as Heading,

[2023-12-27, 21:18:59] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: These are likely to be on-device LLMs so probably quite light, and not aimed at big benchmarks.
[2023-12-27, 21:51:02] ~ Sourabh: Interesting. Points to it being implemented in iPhones maybe like a Siri enhancement? since it’s multimodal, they can market it like, Siri can now “see”? Or rename it to ‘See’ri? 😁

[2023-12-27, 22:13:59] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: Idea is to get the QPS essentially performance at the end points ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-12-27, 22:15:00] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Lol, maybe - I think having on-device LLMs opens up a lot of opportunities. You can do privacy aware stuff and not have to collect some of the user's data. It also prevents data misuse. Apart from being fast because you don't have to hit an API over the network
[2023-12-27, 22:15:39] Vrushank Vyas: Can pull specific ones for you..

[2023-12-27, 22:19:02] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: Idea is let’s say I have platform as a service (PaaS) and I have k8 deployed but there are multiple layers, but I want performance at endpoints this way I can tell that this is the performance of my model on Infra and minus the layers this is my performance at end points
[2023-12-27, 22:19:43] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: Any thoughts on this will really help
[2023-12-27, 22:26:27] Ravi Theja: I think you can explore portkey here - @919899951010 / @919700888848 can help you with this. portkey - https://portkey.ai/.

[2023-12-28, 13:02:34] Shan: I’ll be glad if people stop using OpenAI as a search engine as a result of this 😀. But anyways the standard argument from US companies is always that “someone in China is doing it” and it’s going to apply here also. I’m ignoring this completely - I don’t think anything is going to happen. #ianal

Some folks have tried using the prompts, nyt has cited in their complaint, but been unable to repro the nyt copyrighted contents.

OpenAI could also make changes to the model, to filter out nyt content.

Regardless, this case will set a precedent for copyright claims on publicly available or crawled training data ‎<This message was edited>

[2023-12-28, 17:52:13] Suhas Motwani: https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/publication/orca-2-teaching-small-language-models-how-to-reason/

Earlier this year, Microsoft Research unveiled Orca, a 13-billion parameter model that can emulate the intricate reasoning processes exhibited by other LLMs. 

Specifically, Orca learns from GPT-4 signals including explanatory traces, meticulous step-by-step thinking, and a myriad of complex instructions. A few weeks ago, Microsoft expanded on that line of work with the release of Orca 2, an extension of the groundbreaking work that delves even deeper into the domain of Small Language Models (SLMs).

A slightly out of date but still quite good architecture diagram is here: https://a16z.com/emerging-architectures-for-llm-applications/ 2. Read papers - there are papers on everything from LLMs to prompts to what have you. A good start is an overview paper like https://arxiv.org/abs/2303.12712 3. Understand the applications. https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.07361.pdf is a good overview for wider applications of gpt4 in science.  There’s PLENTY more!

[2023-12-29, 10:17:54] Nirant K: Damn, good speakers @919998028952 @919945307938
[2023-12-29, 11:06:33] Priyank Agrawal: RAG experts in here, need suggestions -

Use case - A chatbot builder website, user can create a Knowledge base (pdf, excel, text) and then create a bot (with some base prompt) and then attach these KBs to these bots.

Context - We already have langchainJS with Azure OAI setup in node js code. Priority is speed and serverless with free/payg (new app thus very very low usage). A chat session will be short-lived ~3-5 mins max, we don't need to re-load old chats, we can expire/delete them immediately.

Question - What is a better approach for supporting KBs/RAG in this?

1. HNSWLib + s3 --- Create and store vectors on s3 (one file per bot) and load them in memory just before a new conversation starts and then keep using that chain object/instance.
2. LanceDB -- if option 1 will have some problems that I do not see yet, then this looks decent alternative.
3. Astra DB --- because it's a proper vector DB and it is truly serverless with a good monthly free limit.
4. Any other better approach?

[2023-12-29, 11:11:47] ~ Nayan Shah: 2. LanceDB -- if option 1 will have some problems that I do not see yet, then this looks decent alternative.
in our organisation we had checked and its not wholly serverless . if u are planning to use FTS index internally it uses the tantivy and that indexes are not supported with serverless .
[2023-12-29, 11:12:39] Shan: A bit sad that there’s a clash on Jan 5
[2023-12-29, 11:14:28] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: that is bangalore for you :) 4-5 events almost clash always on Fridays/weekends :)
[2023-12-29, 11:14:46] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: @917737887058 @919945473641
[2023-12-29, 11:17:51] ~ Nayan Shah: would say if u are looking at good amount of data size u should go with the , qdrant / chroma ( chroma has some problem at scale but 1-2mil should be fine and help u start this up ) and as u mention if u have an option to expire/delete data then that will keep the data size in check , 

also fiass with memmap also is a great shout for this , if u dont have much data requirement , before vectordbs for semantic FAQ usecase we use that and that is pretty scalable as well with memmap ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-12-29, 11:20:53] Priyank Agrawal: Nice, thanks, I assumed HNSWlib and Fiass is very same
[2023-12-29, 11:21:15] Priyank Agrawal: Any differences?
[2023-12-29, 11:26:08] ~ Nayan Shah: not similar , one is tree-based structure and another is graph based on most cases hnswlib works out better mostly on CPU , and hnswlib has become standard ( Qdrant, Chroma ) do use that or re-written that for there usecase ... ‎<This message was edited>
[2023-12-29, 11:28:19] ~ Nayan Shah: i suggested Faiss as if u don't want to much complexity and u don't have too much data then that may work out better with simpler IVF or l2 index.

They want corporate courses that discuss how different departments can increase their efficiency by using different AI tools for Marketing, HR, Finance, Sales, Ops, R&D, Legal, QA, and so on. They want to create a program that can update every few months with the latest tools. If anyone is working on such AI courses or knows any relevant resources, please do reach out. My reading is that this can be a decent-sized paid project.

[2024-01-01, 11:39:19] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: what are the best platforms to fine-tune 7B models, looking for options on the cheaper side? ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-01, 11:40:35] Nirant K: I suspect one can do LoRA over a Google Colab Pro+ now?
[2024-01-01, 11:41:04] Ravi Theja: heard h20.ai provides a really good platform for finetuning. @918754563846 should be able to help you.
[2024-01-01, 11:52:16] Phani Srikanth: H2O-LLMStudio and HuggingFace AutoTrain provide a no-code approach to fine-tuning LLMs. Happy to answer any questions on LLMStudio.

I’ve heard good things about Axolotl as well but I’ve never tried it (although it might not qualify to be a platform).

[2024-01-01, 16:31:40] ~ RISHAV: I need some suggestions

I have a pipeline of a retriever and Flan T5. It takes more than 30 sec to run the whole pipeline which depends on the number of keys to extract.

So I have used Redis Queue in which I put the process as soon as I get a request and after completion it hits another fetch API. 

Are there any better options or any standardized approach other than this?

[2024-01-01, 19:27:02] Vignesh Baskaran: This is very interesting. For people who need a summary:  
1. Kevin creates a study guide for LeetCode problems by building a graph where edges represent similarity between Leetcode problems
2. Then creates a minimum spanning tree to ensure a broad but efficient coverage
3. Then determines a study order based on this tree, starting from the easiest problem.
The trick of using a Minimum Spanning Tree is really cool! ‎<This message was edited>

Very useful library to submit training jobs, inference servers - cloud agnostic and support for spots instances.
[2024-01-02, 01:16:20] Akash Tandon: Playing around with autogen (https://github.com/microsoft/autogen) and had couple of questions.

- Other than autogen paper/blog/repo, what are some good resources to experiment with or read to better understand state of AI agents?
- Has anyone here tried to hook autogen with an llmops platform such as portkey?

[2024-01-02, 05:54:27] Aashraya Sachdeva Observe: 15s still sounds a lot. What is the average input/token length? If your model is running in native torch, would recommend optimizing it using  an accelerator. fastertranformer, trt-llm support t5.. this should reduce your latencies by atleast 5times.
[2024-01-02, 07:25:08] ~ RISHAV: Thanks for the suggestions, I would include this in my next steps.

My average token length is around 1024. I am running using Hugging face.
[2024-01-02, 07:42:01] ~ K10: 1. Are you loading the model again and again for each request.  

2. Redis queue is self managed, you need to ensure its running all the time else it would be a loss of requests. 

3. I would suggest going ahead with managed ones because you will get a lot more functionalities like , message processing time , dead letter queue, visibility time out etc. 

4. Please explain your pipeline, what all processes you are doing and how it is Getting handled. Since g5.x-large  has less Power full CPU. 

5. I would suggest seperate put CPU and GPU operations so get the speed up. 

6. Reduce model size using some advance model quantization, pruning etc. 

7. Try to optimise your document processing code to less time complexity. 

Hope it helps.
[2024-01-02, 07:43:47] ~ K10: Define your process if it's realtime inference then you need to optimise code and model. 


If it's a batch process you can decouple results generation and request response using managed queue.

Not the usual prediction. Not technical. Very abstract.

Its on personal assistants and how services might evolve around humans. With user assistant apis interfacing with service apis. 

It’s a simple and minimal framework. But a good read nonetheless.

I’m working on something similar with Knowledge Graphs at the core of designing personal assistants

This seems to be coded to handle gsm, MMLU and such benchmarks and not generalizable out of the box to other datasets
[2024-01-02, 16:57:25] ~ Sandya Saravanan: sorry if this is not the right forum for this question. Which companies/startups in India do LLM model porting for new HW architectures?

[2024-01-02, 17:48:53] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: They are looking for pytorch to custom accelerator, I know very few people who did that, and mostly are at Intel for Gaudi, but not in the group.
[2024-01-02, 17:59:02] ~ Aastha: Sorry, if it's a silly question - what's LLM model porting ?
[2024-01-02, 18:02:04] ~ Sandya Saravanan: Thanks Nirant
[2024-01-02, 18:04:00] ~ Sandya Saravanan: If you have a pytorch llm model say mistral enabled on cuda nvidia hardware, one may want to port it to a different hardware accelerator like intel gaudi. This requires supporting of new needed pytorch operators on that architecture, as well as supporting any custom kernels (eg flash attention).
[2024-01-02, 18:06:22] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Can you provide some background about the architecture that you're trying to port? More context would help. There are not many companies in the world who would be making custom hardware that needs porting.
[2024-01-02, 18:07:05] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Intel, Google, AMD, Cerebras already have teams doing it
[2024-01-02, 18:07:29] ~ Sandya Saravanan: This was for a corporate contact of mine. I am not sure whether they can give more details. Will ask  and get back
[2024-01-02, 18:07:54] ~ Aastha: Okay, This is for the same model to run in different hardware accelerators - for higher performance ?

[2024-01-02, 18:11:56] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yeah. I'm wondering who is making custom GPUs without figuring out a software strategy.
[2024-01-02, 18:14:27] ~ Aastha: Does software strategy mean how to easily run code written in different frameworks ?
[2024-01-02, 18:15:24] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: FYI I'm working on this. Creating a new framework to allow different vendor GPUs to support AI. Going to focus on Intel Arc gpus for the time being because of their amazing value for money. My software stack is going to be based on MLIR.
[2024-01-02, 18:16:51] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: Sounds interesting, what does a new framework means here?
[2024-01-02, 18:17:24] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: It's a compiler
[2024-01-02, 18:18:26] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Something between PyTorch and Harware, you mean?
[2024-01-02, 18:18:42] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: Yes. On the point.

[2024-01-02, 18:19:14] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: Hopefully frontend is Triton and backed is whatever I want to work with.
[2024-01-02, 18:19:59] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: That's the idea. I want support for Intel and aws gpus.

[2024-01-02, 18:29:47] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: what exact support you are looking for Intel ? Can you elaborate. Also you mentioned Triton, you mean Triton inference Server and are you using TensorRT-LLM lib, that should help
[2024-01-02, 18:34:54] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: Honestly, not expecting much support from Intel beyond their documentation. Already have their hardware.

By Triton I mean OpenAI Triton DSL - it's the same way torch.compile works.
[2024-01-02, 18:35:44] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Triton is not an inference server na?
[2024-01-02, 18:36:24] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: I'd prefer if there's no seperate step and the support is built right into pytorch. Like how nvidia is supported. That's the ideal experience.
[2024-01-02, 18:37:01] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: Triton has an Triton Inference Server : https://github.com/triton-inference-server/server
[2024-01-02, 18:37:17] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: No. Triton I mean is the DSL from OpenAI. An alternative to Cuda if you will. https://openai.com/research/triton
[2024-01-02, 18:37:46] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yes yes the openai one
[2024-01-02, 18:37:55] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: Get it, I was looking more from an Inference server that serves as a framework
[2024-01-02, 18:38:06] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Rocm?
[2024-01-02, 18:38:06] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: not the Open AI one
[2024-01-02, 18:38:09] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: I get it
[2024-01-02, 18:38:51] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: I got RoCm working with PyTorch around 3 years ago. Worked with AMD team. RoCm support in pytorch works by transpiling Cuda code to RoCm.
[2024-01-02, 18:39:46] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: So it's a wrapper around a wrapper?😂
[2024-01-02, 18:40:52] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: RoCm is pretty much a clone of CUDA. You replace cu with hip in source files, things work. So during compilation of PyTorch all Cuda files go through this translation step and gets compiled.
[2024-01-02, 18:41:45] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: This is why you use tensor.to('cuda') in pytorch even though you're using amd gpus.
[2024-01-02, 18:55:05] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Would you blog on this more. This seems exciting and interesting
[2024-01-02, 18:56:15] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: That’s how I document 🙂. I’ll post in the GPU group as usual 🙂

[2024-01-03, 07:12:27] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: You just have to request the particular instance you want. For eg, I wanted A100s, so under the azure machine learning portal, you can raise a request. Try for East US 2 region if you want A100s.
[2024-01-03, 07:13:58] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Try changing the region. Also it's under the machine learning portal and not the usual VM instances section. These are managed instances by azure
[2024-01-03, 07:22:18] Adithya S K PESIT: I feel using vm instances gives a lot more flexibility In terms of choosing the image. Disk size and exposing port
The ML portal is ideal to set up large training jobs where the cluster has to be managed and one more thing I have observed with ML studios is that they charge for load balancing even though the instances are not running ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-03, 07:24:35] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yeah that's true. I struggled with disk space a lot. But I was also unable to request GPU vm instances. I think due to the subscription?
[2024-01-03, 07:31:07] Adithya S K PESIT: If you are under the sponsorship sub (founders hub)
It can be done by raising a technical support request
Or 
Create a resource group in East us and while selecting machine size search for "NC" and request quota. from then usually takes 2 to 3 days

if any good reads is also fine ?
[2024-01-03, 12:55:42] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: GGML uses weight calibration for quantizing the model - you load up the model, adjust the weights using 8 bit, 4 bit, 2 bit representations, and save the model. GGML directly converts weights to quantized values without loading them - as far as I know. AWQ is an activation aware technique of quantization - weights are not all equally important as we know from thingslike dropout regularization - so the quantization approach here tries to protect the weights that really matter.

[2024-01-03, 16:16:52] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: Wow. Very cool. 
What are the scenarios in which pre training from scratch may be better than fine tuning? Niche domains?
[2024-01-03, 16:19:39] Rohit Aggarwal: I’m also eager to learn about this..
[2024-01-03, 16:21:51] Nirant K: For $20, every scenario which was finetuning in 2020 gets unlocked for pre-training in 2024. But to expand a little, it's particularly useful for niche domains and NLP applications which can use [MASK] e.g. think the Cloze test based applications. There are quite a few _regulatory_ scenarios where you can now get task-specific performance boost for pennies on the dollar with  this.

The other improvement is that this has a much larger sequence length at 2048 — which you can imagine being very useful for embedding models in particular.

[2024-01-03, 16:47:48] Nirant K: If I were thinking with a Product Engineer's hat, I'd think about everything I've read and written and using the $20 every month to make a new model with different data weights, blended with what I want to learn/read/write — and then use that. This can and include elements of style. 

E.g. within this group itself, I've changed my writing style 3x in 9 months, twice intentionally and once unintentionally — but the topics I interact with have largely been the same 2-4
[2024-01-03, 16:48:29] Nirant K: Think Rewind.ai on steroids — not a personal assistant or copilot, and instead a personal query engine
[2024-01-03, 16:49:58] Paras Chopra Wingify: Doesn’t GPT4 do the same? For a consumer, using it brats fine tuning, no?

[2024-01-03, 16:50:50] ~ Satpal: Extending Llama for Other languages: https://arxiv.org/abs/2401.01055

1. Suggest against vocab extension. (0.5 B tokens pre-training without vocab extension beat 30 B tokens pre-training with vocab extension). 

2. Pretraining with 100 billion tokens or fewer is insufficient to significantly improve LLaMA’s Knowledge level. However, enhancing LLaMA’s response quality (i.e., language generation capability), requires only hundreds of thousands of instruction data rather than a largescale further pretraining.

3. When finetuning, train on mix of English + your language to retain English performance.

[2024-01-03, 16:52:01] Paras Chopra Wingify: Isn’t OpenAI embedding good enough?

[2024-01-03, 16:55:56] ~ Nishkarsh | usefindr.com: What models do you think perform better than openai embeddings for retrieval?
[2024-01-03, 16:55:58] ~ Nishkarsh | usefindr.com: ahaha same
[2024-01-03, 16:57:00] Kartik Mandaville: we've been testing tflan and tinyllama for a specific use case but haven't seen good results. Will try this out
[2024-01-03, 17:00:10] Nirant K: For wider audience, OpenAI Embedding is the worst bang for your buck for 3 reasons:

1. Latency — you can do faster on most laptops made after 2018
2. Cost — you can do cheaper on most EC2 machines, both GPU and CPU
3. Quality — you can get perf for your RAG by using something OSS without finetuning

Here is what I'd look at:

1. Code Embedding — OpenAI is a strong baseline
2. English, Internet domain — bge-large and bge-base are both amazing baselines and beat the daylights out of OpenAI + they are easy to finetune
3. Non English e.g. Indic, Arabic — e5, gte multi-lingual set of models
[2024-01-03, 17:06:47] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: Very interesting. Will maybe try doing this myself.
[2024-01-03, 17:07:11] Nirant K: Cohere amongst the paid ones — miles ahead, BGE Family in the OSS English ones, followed by GTE and e5 families. That's 10 models which you can select for latency, cost, perf tradeoffs
[2024-01-03, 17:07:16] ~ prasanna kumar: yes even i have tried bge-base and large embedding model which works good
[2024-01-03, 17:07:58] Shahul Kaggle Kernel GM: Sure, if the task at hand needs the LLM to have better knowledge of the domain/ language one can do continual pre-training. This process can be hard and expensive but this is the way if one wants to add more knowledge of any new domain/lang to LLM.
[2024-01-03, 17:08:00] Shahul Kaggle Kernel GM: https://github.com/hpcaitech/ColossalAI/tree/main/applications/Colossal-LLaMA-2 for reference

[2024-01-03, 22:10:19] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: I am also curious why is pretraining better than fine-tuning. Isn't pretraing for generalization and fine tuning is to make a model work for your usecase?
[2024-01-03, 22:13:30] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Finetuning works for most use cases. It is also cost effective. 
Nothing beats pre training on your corpus. Especially if you want to add tokens and new words to your LLM vocab 
Or you want the LLM to be more likely to memorize your corpus which is what nyt is accusing openai of. Those things are achieved with pre training.

Best example of why pre training over finetuning is sarvam AI openhathi model. They reduced the token consumption per generation for Hindi generation while also adding new vocab and better generalization to Hindi text
[2024-01-03, 22:13:48] ~ RISHAV: Use paddle ocr and get the bounding box where the text is present.

Parse those bounding boxes to any colour detection modules (cv2 might have some).

[2024-01-03, 23:18:29] ~ Ashish Singhal: So I used this prompt fashion on multi-class classification only.

I've provided class list first and then document for classification. And specifically mentioned only one class applies to the document. 

Interesting thing is when classes are too domain specific and LLM doesn't understand enough. In that case you can provide the class description with respect to each classes.

Then LLM will tag it as per the class description and the provided document.
[2024-01-04, 01:04:28] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: There is a paper from Google which suggests the opposite method for finetuning. By replacing the labels name with random words (like foo, bar), performance improved ‎<This message was edited>

Qdrant doesn't allow explicit versioning within the store, but you can do that by adding "last_updated" as a payload, and it'd meet like 60-80% of all versioning use cases I've seen in the wild.

3. One doesn't have to start building a business with Tech moat from day one. But one has to definitely start a business by solving a problem. The real moat in this case, is the leverage that Yasser has gained by working so closely with customers and now he has deep insights that most others might not have.

OAI has released details on their blog for GPT builder architecture detail 
Like we suspected it’s a GPT itself with system instructions which has tools to set the instructions for custom GPT

This is the base context prompt 

“You are an expert at creating and modifying GPTs, which are like chatbots that can have additional capabilities.
Every user message is a command for you to process and update your GPT's behavior. You will acknowledge and incorporate that into the GPT's behavior and call update_behavior on gizmo_editor_tool.
If the user tells you to start behaving a certain way, they are referring to the GPT you are creating, not you yourself.
If you do not have a profile picture, you must call generate_profile_pic. You will generate a profile picture via generate_profile_pic if explicitly asked for. Do not generate a profile picture otherwise.
Maintain the tone and point of view as an expert at making GPTs. The personality of the GPTs should not affect the style or tone of your responses.
If you ask a question of the user, never answer it yourself. You may suggest answers, but you must have the user confirm.
Files visible to you are also visible to the GPT. You can update behavior to reference uploaded files.
DO NOT use the words "constraints", "role and goal", or "personalization".
GPTs do not have the ability to remember past experiences.', “

[2024-01-05, 18:44:44] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Are you using the GPT builder with GPT-4 ?
It already uses GPT-4 with Vision 

You have to just create a workflow where you ask user to upload an image and what analysis you want to conduct on  image you add it in the instruction prompt 

It will perform analysis on the image without any additional Action or vision API

[2024-01-05, 20:19:28] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I shudder to think of it. Imagine asking an LLM a question and getting an ad expertly woven into the answer. Marketer's dream, consumer's nightmare.
[2024-01-05, 20:19:47] Priyesh OnFinance: 😂 yes but the point is LLM ads wont have explicit CTAs
[2024-01-05, 20:19:51] Priyesh OnFinance: tbh

[2024-01-05, 20:21:23] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: CTA - call to action? Yeah, that makes sense. Subliminal marketing is how we got to where we are though. Hard marketing that led to click based revenue is more tangible. Grooming customers through subliminal messaging is more of a long term play. Uncomfortably borders with social engineering
[2024-01-05, 20:22:09] Priyesh OnFinance: 100% agreed
[2024-01-05, 20:22:36] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: If the user prefers a single window, yes. Agreed. And you're right overall going by how people and businesses think about consumption. Convenience is a feature, and people are willing to pay for it.

[2024-01-05, 20:25:21] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: That's where I think the category will split, but still pplx will be really huge and get gulped by big fish
[2024-01-05, 20:26:53] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Salesforce are likely to pick someone up - they were seen hunting around the time OpenAI was in crisis some time ago. Whether there is strategic fit or not- Benioff seemed interested enough to make distant bets away from the SF platform
[2024-01-05, 20:29:03] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Anyone interested in public search engines may express interest. Bing included.  They have doubled down on OpenAI these days but given what happened with Altman wanting to join and backing off, one never knows.
[2024-01-05, 20:30:48] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I don't see strong competition to pplx though. What others are there? Anthropic and others are closed offerings and make no effort to advertise, and Bing is the only other real contender apart from ChatGPT. Vercel perhaps?
[2024-01-05, 20:32:02] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: pplx can do search and context, but for personalization, there is a huge amount of streaming data that needs to be used, and for every vertical, the sources are different and uncountable. At one point, a generic llm company could not scale to read my Nest, Apple watch, and Weather context, and comprehend it to give me actionable suggestions.

[2024-01-06, 00:34:14] Rajaswa Patil: I agree. But sometimes I think about how people said the same thing about auto-regressive LLMs in their early days.
[2024-01-06, 00:34:44] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: That's why I signed off with today’s date.
[2024-01-06, 00:35:59] Rajaswa Patil: Haha! Fair.
[2024-01-06, 00:45:07] Nirant K: FWIW, heard the VP Engineering of OpenAI say that they're looking to make agents happen with a mix of LLM and more advanced APIs. They acknowledged that it's not quite there yet, but they really want to.
[2024-01-06, 00:49:12] ~ Rohan: I've seen a lot of discussion on this group and elsewhere about "agents". How exactly do you define an agent, and how is it different from an LLM or an API backed by an LLM? If it's just the ability to take actions, doesn't function calling enable LLM APIs to do that?
[2024-01-06, 00:54:05] Rajaswa Patil: I’ve seen people use the term “Agent” loosely.
[2024-01-06, 00:54:29] Rajaswa Patil: I think for now there are only broad definitions that are kinda obvious
[2024-01-06, 00:54:47] Rajaswa Patil: One is in the abstract of this white paper on agents by OAI -

NG is also co-founder of Coursera. Courses by Chroma or any other Brand seems to be a branding strategy more than a real education effort.
[2024-01-06, 11:43:20] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: The advanced API part is interesting. The problem with agents is planning and reasoning. If LLMs get better at that why would advanced API's be needed?

[2024-01-06, 20:54:37] ~ Prateek🖤: Anyone worked/having experience with document level translation?

( APIs / LLMs etc? )

( Not with Google translate, assemblyAi please)
[2024-01-06, 20:56:09] Nirant K: What are you looking for? Building own NMT models?

The cloud APIs and LLMs do the 80% thing quite well
[2024-01-06, 20:56:40] ~ Prateek🖤: Nope

Just looking for a large scale document translation pipeline for business simplification
[2024-01-06, 20:59:28] ~ Prateek🖤: And it should be good enough for complete documents which are typically 30 to 50 pages Pdf/word files.

Done so far:

1. Tried paid Google translate/azure cognitive service / assembly Ai - poor context after translation at document level.. it works fine when I'm sending specific blocks of texts

2. Tried with LLMs, but the due to output token limits it would hit token limitations

3. Tried breaking documents in chunks for translation and then stitching them in final output stage - but it causes semantic info loss and context is a bit off at time too
[2024-01-06, 21:00:00] ~ Prateek🖤: They do

But i dont see a complete document level usecase or example happening around

If you have any leads, please share the resources
[2024-01-06, 21:39:42] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: You can try this and also try with indictrans2 models / APIs ? Also what language are you trying to translate ?
[2024-01-06, 21:40:46] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: I think most translation models cause semantic info loss itself.
[2024-01-06, 21:41:41] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: So the solution has to be mix of hybrid (generate using mix of models and then run human evaluation and correction) to get 100% accurate translation currently, depending on what language are you trying to translate. Each target language will have different WERs and accuracy. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-06, 21:43:54] Arko C | xylem.ai: Can be avoided to a huge extent by feeding a well-curated system prompt about the persona, use case, etc. Ofc this works only if the translation is for similar domain/use case/used by specific professionals.
[2024-01-06, 21:46:38] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: if he is using LLMs for document translation then yeah, he can  experiment with these.

I was talking on just translation models such as indictrans2 (NMT model) which takes in input in one language and output sentences in target langauges. Eg English to Hindi and Hindi to English viceversa. Perhaps Spanish, French may have lower translation WERs, but, I'm not an expert in metrics of those. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-06, 21:47:46] Arko C | xylem.ai: Aaah yes, that’s true
[2024-01-06, 21:47:47] Nirant K: Hmm, the question here is about pdf/docx kinda enterprise translations — and I'd rather let the enterprise solve it
[2024-01-06, 22:30:47] ~ Prateek🖤: LLMs are worse if you are going for enterprise grade translation

( Trust me.. I have tried enough 🥺 )

WER and semantic loss keeps on increasing with more and more information in input feed

I am mostly looking to translate french German Italian Spanish and Portuguese
[2024-01-06, 22:31:23] ~ Prateek🖤: From pretrained NMT models,

Mbart50 from Facebook I found most appropriate so far, but even that causes hiccups at times
[2024-01-06, 22:32:33] ~ Prateek🖤: So true

I was thinking of this as the last resort until/unless i can figure out a solution which can be fully automated at least as per the success metrics and benchmarks set as per the business criteria
[2024-01-06, 23:07:34] ~ Pramod: Hello All, I'm currently doing sales prospect research that involves scraping data from the internet, creating an index using Llama Index(on raw files), and querying this index for a final research report. The cost currently is $5 per each prospect given ~1GB of data.

I'm looking for ways to reduce the cost and considering two options 
1. Extracting only relevant chunks from the web pages and indexing them
2. Using an open-source Large Language Model (LLM) instead of OpenAI

In both cases, I'm concerned about the reduction in the quality of the final response. Has anyone worked on a similar problem before? Also, for #2, what are the best open source options to use with llama index (as a potential replacement for openai). TIA!
[2024-01-07, 00:16:51] Nirant K: cc @919550164716

1 — Relevance is a very broad idea, but if you're looking at embedding in particular: OSS routinely beats OpenAI Embedding. You can combine it with RRF in Llama Index
2 — Mistral MoE is quite competitive to GPT3.5, and can be finetuned _affordably_
[2024-01-07, 00:25:12] Lucifer 😎: What's RRF ?

[2024-01-07, 09:04:37] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Reciprocal rank fusion is implemented into Elasticsearch and other search engines. A good fit for use cases where you have to use search as a component of AI systems. Many new search engines and data bases do come with embedding storage as a feature.

[2024-01-07, 10:05:28] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: Have you tried expanding the context each chunk gets and then stitching the text using llms

For example:

Chunk 1-2-3 -> translated llm input 0

Chunk 2-3-4 -> translated llm input 1

Chunk 3-4-5 -> translated llm input 2

And then ask llms to stitch 

Chunk 1 into chunk 2 and so on

1. build your eval set 
2. ⁠try out eith GPT 4 and set that as your benchmark 
3. ⁠try the eval with open source models and see how much the degradation is
4. ⁠if the degradation seems acceptable then you can continue using the OSS model (at least you’ll know what you are missing)
[2024-01-08, 19:17:52] ~ Neeraj: Hi guys, 
I am building a RAG application with a feedback option where a user can give feedback to the generated answer in two ways:
1. A simple thumbs down or thumbs up 
2. They also edit the response with a correct response. (Assume that the user edit is always correct )
Now, if someone asks the same or similar question it should respond with the edited answer and/or not consider the thumbs down answer when generating a response.
A simple way to do it is every time someone edits it we index that question and edited answer pair again. But the problem with this is it doesn’t guarantee the next time someone asks the same or similar question it gives a correct answer. 
Does anyone has any suggestions I can use to make this work the best possible way?
[2024-01-08, 19:21:49] Anil Chandra Naidu Matcha: It should suggest the right answer next time as it will have higher similarity than other content
[2024-01-08, 19:25:21] ~ Neeraj: Agreed, when the question is very similar to question that is indexed but what happens when it’s only a partial match? I know it’s very theoretical and I will conduct experiments to find out but I just wanted to know if there are any other way that can help me do these kind of feedback tasks better

[2024-01-08, 19:35:56] ~ Neeraj: Actually, the problem in just indexing and not doing anything else in the use case I describe is that, the data retrieved to generate the wrong answer earlier (before we added the edited data) still exists in the database so even though the updated answer is added to the data, the retriever will still retrieve the correct data and wrong data. So the final generated answer will be affected. How do I surpass that? 😅

[2024-01-09, 11:29:01] Chetanya Rastogi: I think the guy who made marker (pdf to markdown) also tweeted that he has trained a model for his OCR pipeline that does line identification using bounding boxes.
[2024-01-09, 11:29:52] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Very interesting. I haven't read that one, but will find out. Who is attempting to replicate this? Anyone in this group?
[2024-01-09, 11:29:55] Nirant K: Vik? Yes, marker is quite good. And this looks quite neat too: https://twitter.com/VikParuchuri/status/1744561822450188438

[2024-01-09, 11:44:50] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Is OCR really the limitation for use cases this approach addresses? Would this not add value in understanding machine generated text like Arxiv papers etc? I think currently we are learning only text on it and this adds spatial understand as well - information which is stripped off?

[2024-01-09, 12:16:12] Sumod K Mohan: There are counter examples as well. Whenever there is lots of edge cases, if you can carve up niches then that can make you some money. Ask Nico Jiminez of MathPix. We had done some work which in that narrow use case performed quite well and were able to manage all edge cases. With a small % (orders of mag less than single digit %), that needs to be human verified. But the real question is will the higher accuracy of OCR alone make a viable business. Yes, the Kofax's etc made money of it in their era.

This might be a thing several years down the line - SEO variant for Large Language Models.
[2024-01-09, 15:09:19] Rajaswa Patil: Also, a good business opportunity / incentive for players who establish dominance as OSS model provider (in terms of distribution/adoption).

They can essentially charge institutions (corporates, political parties, etc.) to boost their content in LLM outputs by manipulating pre-training data, moderation, etc!?

[2024-01-09, 21:25:02] Pratyush Choudhury: Thanks sir, found some time to get to this

I have a perspective here (but still thinking more so happy to learn more from folks): one doesn’t need to take away all of Google’s traffic to build a big business/hurt them here, the approach to breaking Google’s network effects can be gradual. I’ll elaborate my thought process:
* One needs to take away a small single digit % of Google’s top value users (that have the highest CPM/whatever is the right attributable metric is)
* ⁠This seems good in theory and incredibly hard to execute but going by ChatGPT’s paid user-base, there seems to be a large number of potential users you could acquire
* ⁠For the remaining share of users, a good business model could well be to take away a part of the search volume - say I do 10 Google searches today vs 5/5 split b/w PPLX & Google (which I think is already happening among early adopters)
* ⁠One could argue that the above logic could apply to the single digit % of Google’s top users as well
* ⁠If you’re able to execute well on this, Google’s network effects will be challenged seriously probably for the first time & maybe another big tech finds you attractive enough to buy
* ⁠And if I don’t want to sell as a founder to another big tech, I could live to fight another day & eventually figure out a business model gradually - Rome wasn’t built in a day

Here's the keynote released just now by Rabbit Tech where they launched a new device called r1 along with RabbitOS which is powered by a Large Action Model meant to replicate steps taken by a user on an app to automate actions. It's priced at 199$ and pitched as an AI companion and also comes with a 360° camera to support vision inputs too.

I've strong conviction that this is a step in the right direction. I'm working on a side passion project called Hobbes with a similar vision. Would love to chat up in case someone has views for / against this or working in similar fields!
[2024-01-10, 00:41:45] Priyesh OnFinance: strong for. I actually wanted to pretrain a model with a full vocabulary around OS actions but not enough raw data to pull this off

[2024-01-10, 09:53:27] Lucifer 😎: i am still not amazed at this
I mean, other apps and os can do this given they have lot more permission to it

this os has just merged all of the features in one place. 

I might be wrong, but will wait for version 2 of this and some updates from pixel phones 
Pixel already have ton of those features built in. Just that, you have to open up some apps to do so
[2024-01-10, 09:56:03] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: I have the same question. Have been trying out many things for Kannada using Tesseract, PaddleOcr and other stuff. On clean PDFs, it is good enough for most content using Tesseract.

[2024-01-10, 10:01:12] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: yes, I'm exploring the ones we can train and update as in open src ones, didn't look at cloud apis. But a lot of enterprise apis should do better I'm sure. Just that they are paid.
[2024-01-10, 10:04:31] Paras Chopra Wingify: These are misguided

Our phones will be personal AI companion
[2024-01-10, 10:05:27] Priyesh OnFinance: sure but the point is will that be on the OS layer or over on the app side
[2024-01-10, 10:06:09] ~ Mayank Gupta: I think it'll be both. Like say 2 agents communicating via API to get it done

[2024-01-10, 10:20:32] Priyank Agrawal: The demo is ok... But i seriously don't get WHY it needs a new device, this is mostly software stuff that they did ... With a decent enough investment any APP + Cloud combination can do these exactly the same things
[2024-01-10, 10:21:16] Priyank Agrawal: They can't do everything my device does on day one and so then as user i need to keep 2 devices which is a very tough uphill battle.
[2024-01-10, 10:21:59] Priyank Agrawal: I would buy this software that listens to me and get wide array of tasks done like shown in the demo. But not another device.

[2024-01-10, 11:16:10] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: CES is designed to be the product feature playground for Apple. I have been burned by Apple in consumer hardware space before, and that is the battle small startups can’t win.

[2024-01-10, 11:17:49] Sudharshan GenAI: I get what avi is doing with Tab - it's a wearable necklace. We've worn necklaces for 1000s of years and it works - getting humans to wear or carry something new that we're not used to is going to be very hard
[2024-01-10, 11:20:10] ~ Mayank Gupta: Mean this with all due respect and wanting to learn from your experience too
[2024-01-10, 11:21:36] Paras Chopra Wingify: Startups thrive on uncertainty - that’s the moat

Either you attack a big company’s core business model or be so uncertain in success that big companies are unable to model risk 

If an innovation is obviously valuable and aligned to a big company’s business model, it’ll be acquired or copied

[2024-01-10, 12:43:21] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Hey do you guys know any apis that are managed vector db apis. Where you not only have an api to upload the chunks but also provide api for retrieving  chunks. 
Not pinecone but say more managed than pinecone.
[2024-01-10, 12:44:48] Nirant K: Not sure what you're looking for, but Qdrant has a cloud?

[2024-01-10, 12:47:45] ~ romit: T4 should be good enough in that case. It is dirt cheap, and has enough memory to handle the model and input sequences. But it would be slow (slow memory bandwidth and less tensor cores)
[2024-01-10, 12:47:50] ~ romit: would try it on CPUs and see
[2024-01-10, 12:48:18] Dhruv Anand: I'm guessing you can use any managed cloud VDB with LlamaIndex or Langchain, as they have all the abstractions/APIs you can think of
[2024-01-10, 12:50:51] Pratik Bhavasar: Right, T4 is definitely the baseline but is there anything even lower?

I came across this
https://aws.amazon.com/ec2/elastic-graphics/pricing/
[2024-01-10, 12:51:12] Pratik Bhavasar: $0.2/4GB
[2024-01-10, 12:52:40] ~ romit: interesting, didn't know about this. Dont know anything cheaper than this. I can check on CPU and get back
[2024-01-10, 12:55:48] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: @919811266476 you provide much better pricing than this right? For consumer instances?
[2024-01-10, 12:57:26] Gaurav MonsterAPI Qblocks: Yup. 11GB GPUs for $0.3/hr and 16GB GPUs for $0.4/hr. 
More options can be explored on Q Blocks.
[2024-01-10, 13:04:42] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: +1, used T4 and found it pretty good but inference speeds are slow
[2024-01-10, 13:06:48] Pratik Bhavasar: That’s great! Although I want to know about the 3 cloud providers for now.
[2024-01-10, 13:07:27] Pratik Bhavasar: My generations are going to be short. So might just work out.
[2024-01-10, 13:14:04] Dilip Ittyera CogniSwitch Founder: We have APIs for both ingestion and provision of response. You need to know that internally it is an automated pipeline that combines vectors + KG + rules. You can check CogniSwitch.ai
Do DM if you need help
[2024-01-10, 14:00:17] Priyank Agrawal: Check out AstraDB
Fully managed and scalable, free tier to start/test well, heard good things from a friend who is using it.
[2024-01-10, 16:55:52] Paras Chopra Wingify: is there any model that can remove gibberish text generated via image generation models?

any post-processing pipeline available
[2024-01-10, 17:04:22] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This would be a godsend for many people. So many times prompts to diffusion models just yield some text that's unnecessary. Despite explicit instructions. Side note - Midjourney has no real instruction following capability, and Dall E 3 is pretty bad at instruction following for images.
[2024-01-10, 17:27:11] Sheetal Chauhan: Slightly iterative and requires hit and trail but you can attach negative weights to types of text the model can generate in certain contexts. 
Sample prompt:
Social media design in blush pink and red color scheme with roses on the edges and white space at the bottom, minimal style — no text, description, text, titles, captions, names, logo
[2024-01-10, 17:32:46] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: That’s interesting. I’ll try that out. Have had little success in getting dalle to generate correct English text. Never correct even if almost correct 😅
[2024-01-10, 17:33:35] Sheetal Chauhan: This was for midjourney. Dalle I agree has no clear way of attaching negative weights
[2024-01-10, 17:34:50] Priyesh OnFinance: yep have seen some sdxl image generation studios have a negative prompt section
[2024-01-10, 17:34:55] Priyesh OnFinance: no fkin clue how it works tho 😂
[2024-01-10, 17:49:11] ~ YP: for DALL-E there's barely anyway to enforce a prompt
[2024-01-10, 17:49:22] ~ YP: except in Bing Image Creator with 15 credits a day
[2024-01-10, 17:56:43] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: if anything midjourney is worse at this, I feel. Hardly any control through the prompt. And if you want to compose images with multiple subjects, then that is harder than it should be
[2024-01-10, 17:58:02] Paras Chopra Wingify: Maybe some opencv hack can at least remove gibberish

Wondering if anyone has worked on it
[2024-01-10, 17:58:34] ~ Siva: When generate image through prompt in Dall-E, I see there is an improvement in correct spelling when mention text strictly should be ' '.
Iteration to obtain with correct spelling reduce but still a long way to go.
[2024-01-10, 17:59:01] ~ YP: I meant GPT-4 takes the driving seat mostly 😅
[2024-01-10, 17:59:19] ~ YP: Any examples of the images going wrong?
[2024-01-10, 17:59:59] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: @919868221372  There seems to be a tool called Photo pea - it has an "AI eraser" much like Adobe photoshop and other such tools. These are hardly programmatic or APIs but they may be useful https://youtu.be/SJzlZi6Q0-Q

"In Q1 we will launch a GPT builder revenue program. As a first step, US builders will be paid based on user engagement with their GPTs. We'll provide details on the criteria for payments as we get closer."

I think plus subscriptions will get a huge boost- both to build(publish) and to use the custom gpts.
will the gpt store be as big for openai, as the App Store & play store were for apple and google respectively ?
there is a 20$ per month barrier to entry to use the gpt store(both as builder to publish, or to use, a custom gpt), so wonder how big the realistic TAM is, especially in a market like india !
I wish they had a PPP(purchasing power parity) lower price for india & other countries, relative to the US ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-01-11, 14:06:42] ~ Akash Singh: Probably a llm which is designed to perform some actions which are transactional/ following some structure like an mdp (markov decision process) as all the applications have some or other tasks like button click or swiping which is performing some action and also have knowledge of generation for having a communication.
[2024-01-11, 14:07:27] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Could be agents that learn from human actions going forward and then mimic them increasingly.
[2024-01-11, 14:08:32] ~ Mayank Gupta: Possibly with vision capabilities to be able to effectively understand the screen and take actions accordingly? ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-01-11, 14:12:30] ~ Akash Singh: I think possibility is huge. Modality is medium to understand, develop a perception. Core being performing actions and having conversations in natural language. Like qwen based models have role playing. Also unfied-io from allenai is a good work. One thing i am curious on is whther they have single encoder for all modalities or separate for each modality.
[2024-01-11, 14:14:13] ~ Mayank Gupta: The other reason I'm saying is that Adept has released few details on their models in blogs and I think they claimed that vision is an important component

we work w/ thousands of users conversing on a daily basis w/ our product, want to figure a system. even ideas are welcome on DMs.
[2024-01-11, 16:38:44] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Very interesting Paras.

Maybe we need a clever combination of speech, typing text, and interaction with UI elements( buttons,  sliders, drop downs, etc) depending on the particular context.

E.g. filling out taxes via a  text chat interface sounds very clumsy and suboptimal from an HCI & ux perspective .

However, while seeking healthcare advice, maybe typing it out in a text chat, with the system asking clarifying followup  questions , is better than a UI form.

Designing the ux, keeping in mind HCI factors, and the nature of information flow, is key. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-11, 17:01:07] Vetrivel PS: What's HCI ?
[2024-01-11, 17:01:39] Priyesh OnFinance: human computer interface

[2024-01-11, 17:04:31] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: So what is your aggregated data like ? And what do you mean by topical analysis, can you be more specific and clear on this ? That will help folks give more specific answers.
[2024-01-11, 17:20:43] Abhiram Ravikumar GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: Topic mining is a branch you may want to look at it. Bertopic is one such technique that used to do topical analysis quite well. I'm sure the llms can do it too
[2024-01-11, 17:24:01] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: NLTK also has a topic modelling (LatentDirichletAllocation). Another popular one is https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/ topic modelling.
[2024-01-11, 17:25:53] Vetrivel PS: Apart from Bertopic, Top2Vec can also be used here
[2024-01-11, 17:41:02] Paras Chopra Wingify: What we need is intelligent UX

Where it self modifies to be more efficient over time depending on usage

Imagine if all our apps adapted automatically to our inferred needs
[2024-01-11, 17:42:00] ~ Mayank Gupta: The one problem with that will be muscle memory. A lot of people click things without realising what it is. Imagine if the buttons changed
[2024-01-11, 17:42:53] ~ Mayank Gupta: Or if you thought that it will change. You won't be able to form mental workflows. Will have to read and scan carefully everytime
[2024-01-11, 17:44:09] Paras Chopra Wingify: AI should account for that

Hide things that are unused, make things that are used a little larger, give easy access to frequently done Arcane functions
[2024-01-11, 17:44:29] Paras Chopra Wingify: No, you don’t randomise UX but cleverly evolve it
[2024-01-11, 17:46:23] ~ Mayank Gupta: Sure. I still think that a lot of apps have the data already. And still don't do major UX updates. Specially for critical workflows.
Personally I think we will have component based UX interactions. Apps will be unbundled into these individual components, each of which can be pulled and interacted with as per need through a central entity.
[2024-01-11, 17:47:28] ~ YP: But what would the inputs be like
Or it should be very zero shot text thing?

I can see reasoning steps that could be present to adapt to needs of a lot of people
[2024-01-11, 17:47:43] ~ Mayank Gupta: So the central entity can be fluid. And adaptive. But the components will allow quick flows.

Though you could be totally right. Would be amazing to see a world with some UX is that dynamic ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-01-11, 17:50:11] Paras Chopra Wingify: This is a though problem to crack as great UXes are often not modular - multiple things interact in multiple ways

Modular UXes are not very efficient. 

But hopefully someone will find a way to make it work :)
[2024-01-11, 17:58:28] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Apps and the os , also ?

Does the os need to expose a user intent inference api/SDK to the apps ?
[2024-01-11, 18:03:24] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: In your vision, would there need to be some sort of standardization of these intent "components", which am guessing are different from today's ux components ?
[2024-01-11, 18:12:12] Paras Chopra Wingify: I think it’ll be interesting to imagine an OS built from grounds up on these principles
[2024-01-11, 18:13:39] ~ Sandeep: topical analysis, in this case, is basically extracting topics from user chats/conversations. 

we wanted to do this at a session level (usually, 7-8 messages long)
[2024-01-11, 18:14:24] ~ Mayank Gupta: Not really. I'll give you an example:
Say the component = the Uber Cab Booking page.
And say the OS level input from me = Help me book a cab from my home to office

So now the exact component as they designed is pulled up with Pickup, Drop, Auto already selected and highlights, just the CTA remaining to be clicked. I could still switch from Auto to UberGo or make any other changes if that's what I want. The buttons are how I remember them.

And then when I get it, I've to look for the same details as I do because it's the same page. But the OS can jump in display my Cab# and OTP over the component (because the OS is fluid) because that's what I always need.

I'll try to think of a better example and DM. But yeah maybe this helps to give a sample.
[2024-01-11, 18:24:26] ~ Mayank Gupta: Another example could be, imagine component to be the Bookmyshow Movie Theater seat selector. The fluid experience is the theater price availability etc at the OS level. But then the BMS component is invoked.
[2024-01-11, 18:26:00] ~ Sandeep: from our experience, NLTK does pretty basic sentimental analysis (positive, negative), their database is pretty small. looking for deeper results (ex: worry, concern, question, statement etc.)
[2024-01-11, 18:26:41] ~ Sandeep: will try gensim, looks interesting. thanks @919916576150

[2024-01-11, 18:45:31] ~ Deepak: Interesting take for current workflows and apps. But I think conv interfaces it would make a lot of sense for 2 cases:
1. Current workflows are sequential/linear, limiting what we do we can apps. We can have complex workflows with parallel and converging tasks with conversational interface( simple example: user speaks to Swiggy, okay buy me a pizza from Domino’s if they’re running an offer or total comes less than 400, or else buy me chicken burger from bk.  Or on something like moengage/webengage: find users who have no opened the app in last 15 days and have not even responded to any campaign in last 6 weeks, create a discount coupon for them and draft a winback campaign)(very superficial use cases, but just thinking out loud the possibilities of HCI)
2. With well crafted UX, things can definitely be done faster but there is always a learning curve, however small. Conversational interface might create a case for disposable apps/websites, those to be used infrequently or for a specific, short-term purpose + expanding apps to new user base(more compute for less tech savvy people)
Thinking out loud, thoughts?
[2024-01-11, 18:50:42] Paras Chopra Wingify: the point is UX gives affordances for users to discover

Thoughts like “tell me all users who have not opened the app”  may not even arise if users don’t know what’s doable and what’s not
[2024-01-11, 19:03:09] ~ Mayank Gupta: https://x.com/naval/status/1745304473587810393?s=20

[2024-01-11, 19:05:03] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: The go_emotions dataset is a bit problematic. Speaking from personal experience as well as from here - https://www.surgehq.ai/blog/30-percent-of-googles-reddit-emotions-dataset-is-mislabeled
[2024-01-11, 19:05:34] Kartik Mandaville: I'm looking to categorize a question into generation(content or code or images), search(searching for a specific thing) and summary (give me all the tickets Kartik worked on yesterday). Curious has anyone does this? Are there more categories? 
Why? This will decide what type of RAG we need to do - RAG with summary, RAG with generation etc
[2024-01-11, 19:36:49] ~ Deepak: UI complementing a context aware conv assistant is a win win and a great overall UX
But my point being, we'll soon be able to get complex tasks done conversationally which we simply cannot in current UI realm.
[2024-01-11, 19:37:35] Vetrivel PS: Anyone knows any Open source Non-LLM models  that can be used for Code generation task from natural language ?
[2024-01-11, 19:38:35] ~ Mayank Gupta: That doesn't mean we should replace UI with conversation entirely. It means we should augment it
[2024-01-11, 19:39:44] ~ Deepak: Absolutely, that's what I'm building 😝
[2024-01-11, 20:05:42] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: In my mind way I think is that there is a common flow for every app which can be better built by human just like today - with strong integration of AI for personalization and automating things which aren't needed  with a copilot sort of interface that users can use for things that are more specialized or not something that is common
[2024-01-11, 20:07:28] ~ Pramod: Has anyone used perplexity API for queries which need internet? How was the experience in terms of reliability?

[2024-01-11, 20:44:49] Saurabh Karn Nyai: If you have a GPU you could use ollama to host it locally. But 8GB might be a problem or you will have to run quantised version.
[2024-01-11, 20:45:17] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Anyways i think ollama is a good starting point to host models locally and then use it with a library to use in programs.

[2024-01-11, 20:52:44] Yash Wadgave Tisac: Rate it
[2024-01-11, 20:52:58] Saurabh Karn Nyai: I think a phi model like a small model could also do that but if you must need llama you can spend a little money or use a smaller model.
[2024-01-11, 20:53:16] Yash Wadgave Tisac: Oh
[2024-01-11, 20:53:26] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Or maybe try few shot prompting with with these smaller models.

[2024-01-12, 08:20:24] ~ Mayank Gupta: Interesting take by Rabbit founder on why they didn't build an app:
https://x.com/jessechenglyu/status/1745555882291646689?s=20
[2024-01-12, 08:33:28] Rahul Chhabra 2016: Most of the points don't seem to be correct in practice. Loads of companies manage to run apps on both iOS and Android, you don't literally give them your code, they can copy you regardless of you making an app on their phone, being placed where a user gets notifications from multiple other sources is a feature not a bug. 

Also derisking on hardware doesn't mean building your own hardware. That in fact opens you up to a massive massive hardware risk of adoption, finding daily use case, retention, supply chain, purchasing abilities. Doing an app abstracts away all this, not recognising that is naivety. 

Overall, bearish on this take and the founders now.
[2024-01-12, 08:35:19] ~ Mayank Gupta: Don't know background well, but from the post it seems like they're hardware people at the core. So maybe that's also what leads to this decision.

[2024-01-12, 11:04:59] Sandesh Anand: The incubator may die, but the hypothesis is not entirely off. Comes in the "known known" bucket of that a16z classification
[2024-01-12, 11:10:15] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: As someone who has been on a similar journey, and happy to talk offline with anyone considering building vertical micro saas

- Chamath has a reputation on snake oil salesman (see his hype and subsequent performance of his spac’s)
- ⁠Contradiction in what he is saying. Enterprises need end to end workflows and workflows + data movement is how big vendors have built lock in. It was never about the feature or cheaper (with caveats). So, if he is saying build micro saas which is 80% cheaper than I don’t know if it’s the right segment to build for
[2024-01-12, 11:15:48] Sandesh Anand: Snake oil salesmen generally get the problem statement right. Just that their solution is "snake oil", which is ineffective :P 
Really good point about enterprises needing end-to-end workflows, which is why I feel incumbents who are willing to pivot have a better chance of winning this game as they understand the workflows and can leverage Gen AI to make it much cheaper. 
But history tells us incumbents often have a hard time pivoting. So, let's see :) ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-12, 11:15:53] Paras Chopra Wingify: Enterprise software is really a lot more than features

It’s mostly buying trust and support
[2024-01-12, 11:17:33] Priyesh OnFinance: 100% along with internal opinions
[2024-01-12, 11:23:00] ~ Pratik Shah: perhaps the TG is SMBs who get sucked into using Enterprise-grade software where they perhaps need 10-20% of features
[2024-01-12, 11:25:55] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Agreed. But the software part can still be 100% automated.
[2024-01-12, 11:26:10] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: If anyone follows the all-in podcast you may know how Chamath is bullish on some things AI (like Jason Calacanis). I think their pessimism about enterprise SaaS is a little misguided because it seems like GenAI can disrupt many such use cases, when seen as a capability, but the details of how that happens is like other things good engineering. And it took a lot of engineering to get to where Salesforce is or other Enterprise SaaSes are. With Gen AI, engineering repeatable value is harder than it looks.
[2024-01-12, 11:27:13] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: They take an investor's viewpoint of enterprise SaaS but the reality is more nuanced, as investors sometimes make bad bets too. I expect that enterprise SaaS will be around in a form similar to current form but with GenAI infusion slowly but steadily
[2024-01-12, 11:29:40] ~ Mayank Gupta: Say what you will but at least he's in the arena trying stuff and always learning.

[2024-01-12, 11:31:21] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yeah, he may make a good bet for those few years but there is no way that kind of pitch has any shot at sustained value. Like a16z's crypto fund, is a short term play at best.
[2024-01-12, 11:32:13] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Also if I wanted enterprise SaaS AI why would I even go to Chamath. I would go to enterprise SaaS providers who are infusing AI. They'll be a better bet anyday because they may know my landscape better and have actual implementation experience

[2024-01-12, 11:43:05] Shashank Generative AI Group: i also felt that their demo was bad. like no thought put into it apart from the glamour aspect (the date, expensive setup etc) 

conflicts with the type of hardware they are selling. (toy category. other eg: curio, playdate)

use cases shown could've been much more interesting. 

and many of these general-purpose copilots, agent demos don't give any consideration to the task specific desired UX. just one user input ( voice or text), loads of agent abstraction, followed by one output in the end. ( everything is a nail ....)
this is not the way for many workflows.

writing a piece on this, hopefully will post by EOD. 

also what does the scroll wheel do? did they talk about it anywhere?

[2024-01-12, 13:25:25] Shan: As an ex founder I can tell you how many times I’ve been asked “why not do it this other way instead” and the real answer is always that you need to focus on only one thing and go in only one direction. If he’d have made an app people would have asked “why not a device” and there are no right answers…. You gotta begin somewhere and take the first step.

Infosys does own finacle
[2024-01-12, 13:41:34] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: True. There is perhaps a bit of overlap. Not mutually exclusive since they do sell solution accelerators
[2024-01-12, 13:43:17] Madhur Chadha: I mean fortune 50 run on custom b2b solutions built by these companies...


If you look closer, they are doing very similar things due multiple clients.."domain expertise" is just another way of saying we built a product and will charge full cost to every buyer :)
[2024-01-12, 13:44:44] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Fortune 50 run - unlikely. They don't have leadership that will prioritize product. They are likely more responsive and will try to sell derivative solutions about what's current to businesses.
[2024-01-12, 13:45:25] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: But competent products like Finacle with AI infused in them based on years of experience, that work in a particular org context - yes. They are probably the only kinds of companies that pull off these kinds of glue systems
[2024-01-12, 14:07:13] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: What if you could just clone Finacle and add your customisations on top at 90% discount on the time & money. Would you still buy Finacle?
[2024-01-12, 14:08:19] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: finacle has nothing to do with the software. good luck dealing with bank audits. you will give up on life before you undergo a 2 year bank audit to get your software inside a bank

[2024-01-12, 14:11:20] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: The second order effects of that are very interesting.
[2024-01-12, 14:12:10] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: but the infrastructure IS the moat. 
infrastructure is also the model. the system of workflows and integrations put together is the IP.
[2024-01-12, 14:13:00] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Agreed. Software has nothing to do with those.
[2024-01-12, 14:13:42] Ankur Pandey: The purpose of starting software companies is to hopefully cash out in few years and then start a hardware company.
[2024-01-12, 14:14:53] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Wish someone had told me this in 2006. 🤣
[2024-01-12, 14:17:13] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: If we follow Apple closely enough. But then there are software companies like Microsoft with barely any hardware play. They made the bulk of their money under license and IP. Seems like having effective lawyers is the most important thing for big software beyond a point sadly
[2024-01-12, 14:18:17] Ankur Pandey: I mean today. Microsoft started in ancient times. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-01-12, 20:10:56] Shikhil Kumar Gupta: Hey everyone, Does anyone have insights into the backend Architecture/Component of perplexity.ai? I've done some research, and it looks like they are utilizing:

1. Bing APIs for real-time search results.
2. OpenAI's GPT-4 Architecture for summarizing content and creating citations.

I'm uncertain if they perform any web indexing at their side, but the speed of their responses suggests they might be doing some form of indexing. What are your thoughts on this?
[2024-01-12, 20:14:18] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: They are doing a lot of web indexing themselves. It’s mentioned in their tos
[2024-01-12, 20:14:32] Sailesh Sydelabs: There was a talk with Azeem Azhar where Aravind had hinted upon the architecture… it would still be high level though but maybe check that out.
[2024-01-12, 20:16:44] Shikhil Kumar Gupta: You mean they are scraping the data from the internet and building indexing at their side? This does not seem to be a scalable option ....then what kind of web indexing they might be doing?
[2024-01-12, 20:16:53] Shikhil Kumar Gupta: Any references?

“Our goal now in the next quarter or so is to move everybody completely to our Perplexity models,” Srinivas said. “And now there is a choice — we can either use LLaMA-2 as a base model or the new Mistral as the base model.”

On the search side, I asked how Perplexity’s search index currently compares to Google in terms of scale?

“We have a billion pages in the index,” he replied. “But, you know, the main point I want to make is [that] search index size is also like a large language model size — it really doesn’t matter how big an index is. What matters more is how high quality the data is; how many high quality web pages are there?”

[2024-01-14, 11:36:14] Shan: For the index, the real question is going to be this actually https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=38923627 and as more and more media strike deals with LLM builders https://openai.com/blog/axel-springer-partnership (an example) - the question is one of product management and positioning / strategy

[2024-01-14, 16:01:59] Lucifer 😎: Afternoon folks,
What are some of the best and widely used Metrics for Documents Similarities

Context : Use context of the content present + image + table if any in the pdf to use for finding the similarity and not just text. 

DB include around ~1M docs and those are indexed
We aim to fetch around top 10 similar docs based on an input docs. 

Note : I cannot cal similar score for all 1M docs before fetching top 10 docs. 

Something which is accurate and efficient needs to be considered. 
Thanks for the time

[2024-01-14, 16:11:36] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Why so?

Have you added filters to your query if that is your concern?
[2024-01-14, 16:11:49] ~ Anindyadeep Sannigrahi: I guess we can treat it as a recommendation problem... Where you can first generate a big pool of candidates and then filter them out? Where candidate generation can be done through consine similarlity and then filtering as a classification problem?
[2024-01-14, 16:15:30] Lucifer 😎: An example will suffice some concerns

- we are working with Lighting pdfs. 
- these pdfs ranges from 1 to 1000 pages. 
- lighting pdfs contains "specifications of lights and sometimes the 2D rough sketch of which lights I am going to install in the building" like - hanging lights, bulbs, mounted to ceil lights, oval lights etc
- a pdf which is 100 pages can have all the details of a certain light. It's height, weight, length, temperature, CRI, CIR, Bearing, material used etc - there are around 30+ attributes
- another pdf has only 1 image of the light which is mentioned above. 1 page pdf only

- these 2 pdf's are very close to each other in nature
- but how can I quantify it. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-14, 16:15:39] Lucifer 😎: I hope this example can help you.
[2024-01-14, 16:17:42] Lucifer 😎: Cosine of 
- image embedding taken from 1 page pdf and 
- all text attributes embedding take from 100 page pdf

Has very less score in calculation. But in nature, these pdf are same. 

The embedding models cannot describe the stats / attributes of a 2D sketched bulb. 
It contains only *lights and anything closer to lights* as context to provide embedding

Those embeddings will never contain information about attributes of bulb just by seeing a bulb.
[2024-01-14, 16:19:33] Dilip Ittyera CogniSwitch Founder: Try extracting the content and creating a graph. Use the graph for retrieval
[2024-01-14, 16:21:39] Lucifer 😎: this was our 1st reasonable thought which I had with my TL 

But the issue is
- graph contains node and edges. 
Nodes let's consider is our light and edges are all the attributes of the lights

- all my 1M docs *never has image and text together* in the pdf
- either image, or text, or image + text

- how can I create nodes and edges for *only image pdf* and *only text pdf* cause any-one of *nodes* or *edges* will be missed accordingly

- You enter precise research questions you’re interested in

- ⁠generates personalised audio summary of why you should pay attention and the novel idea for YOU
[2024-01-14, 21:51:41] Priyesh OnFinance: you can now train an LLM to do this or generate keywords or also use some sort of ghost attention to generate similar question with additional qualifiers

[2024-01-14, 21:52:23] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: there are many methods, spacy has some keyword extraction feature and then there are some python libraries textrank, keywords extraction using sentence embeddings. may be they have added some processing on their own or might have used some llm or model.
[2024-01-14, 21:52:39] Paras Chopra Wingify: Nah, I think this is possible today also.

It’s just expensive but will be highly value creating, not just for ML but for any question you’re obsessing with
[2024-01-14, 21:53:11] Paras Chopra Wingify: All new ideas that scientists are exploring at the edge find their way to people who are most interested in those topics

[2024-01-14, 21:55:12] Paras Chopra Wingify: So if your research area is deep learning for robotics, it will literally scan all incoming paper abstracts for the question: “does it contain any new idea on deep learning for robotics”

Can actually be a simple BERT fine tune :)
[2024-01-14, 22:20:08] ~ Bharath: I wanted to check if it provides a summary of code/equations/citations wherever appropriate in its current form. They don't claim it for now at least.

[2024-01-15, 08:55:25] Pratik Bhavasar: Embrace yourself before you read this.

“We demonstrate this kind of easy-to-hard generalization using simple training methods like in-context learning, linear classifier heads, and QLoRA for seven different measures of datapoint hardness, including six empirically diverse human hardness measures (like grade level) and one model-based measure (loss-based). Furthermore, we show that even if one cares most about model performance on hard data, it can be better to collect and train on easy data rather than hard data, since hard data is generally noisier and costlier to collect.”

Still got to read this for flaws in the study. As someone who chased hard and easy samples for quite a time at work, I did not expect this result. I have my own doubts on generalisation. But if it’s truly true, it’s one less imp thing for ML folks to worry.

has anyone used it? is it better than other 3.5 models? when should we use it?

my understanding was, older version were instruct model (gpt 3) but when they moved to 3.5 and 4, they suggested to use chat completion models instead of instruct models
[2024-01-15, 15:32:56] Priyesh OnFinance: too expensive for just a lora finetune. atleast for us
[2024-01-15, 16:56:07] Rajaswa Patil: Found it fast and better than previous instruct models.

It works well enough for fill-in-the-middle kind of text completion cases, for which I don’t feel like wasting additional tokens using chat models ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-01-15, 17:06:10] Adithya S K PESIT: Took a lot of inspiration from their blog but tried to optimize it for a more compact dataset size
[2024-01-15, 17:15:54] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Same for us actually. One roadblocker was translating existing instruction datasets to kannada without breaking the semantics and do it as quickly as possible
[2024-01-15, 17:16:12] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: We actually tried replicating this - From our testing, GPT-4 is very strong at polite/normal speech level Japanese and could be used reliably for translation, although its throughput and cost was an issue for us. We did a number of human-validated comparisons between DeepL, Google Translate and text-bison-32k, and gpt-4-0613 (also, with human-validated ChatGPT4 assisted reviews like this one) and we found that text-bison-32k could be run cheaply and quickly enough to rapidly generate translations, and using certain simple algorithms, we could use gpt-4 as a "big gun" to fix potentially problematic translations.
[2024-01-15, 17:17:10] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: This is from shisa that jon durbin was up to. Similar to OpenHathi but for Japanese - https://github.com/AUGMXNT/shisa/wiki/A-Review-of-Public-Japanese-Training-Sets
[2024-01-15, 17:19:12] Nirant K: I'm personally happy to sponsor some compute and OpenAI bill both from my pocket — as well as raise from friends, senior engineers for projects like these.

[2024-01-15, 17:22:33] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: We want to do Sanskrit next and eventually all 22 scheduled indic languages.

(either just through few-shot prompting of an LLM, or using something like DSPy to get an optimized prompt for the same: https://arc.net/l/quote/mtgfueuc).

I give a sample json output in prompt and provide schema similar to the instructor repo so it adheres to response schema. This makes it LLM agnostic

the response time fluctuates a lot for me though on gpt-4-1106-preview.

[2024-01-17, 13:31:01] Lucifer 😎: Afternoon folks. 
I'm using Mistral 7B instruct v01 for summary generation based on unstructured raw dump text

I've customised my prompt, but everytime I run it, the model generates kinda different summary. Sometimes it includes 8/10 attributes which I need, sometimes its 10/10, and sometimes it's 5/10 

Are there any methodology by which I can seed the model to generate very similar summaries ?
[2024-01-17, 13:31:02] Lucifer 😎: Thanks

[2024-01-17, 13:42:53] ~ Ritz: I have tried the same getting good results with low temperature. Also it highly dependent on your prompt size. Bigger the prompt higher the chances for hallucination.

Can you please redirect me somewhere ?
[2024-01-17, 13:44:42] ~ Ritz: As I saw default in different frameworks default temperature is 1. Which makes it creative but random

[2024-01-17, 13:46:05] ~ Ritz: Penalisation means using negative instruction
[2024-01-17, 13:46:48] Lucifer 😎: I agree on all of the above suggestions. 

But, my request is can you share some resources which I can read to change the temperature of the default mistral model in prompt ?

[2024-01-18, 15:49:32] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: The openai assistants api. This is for creating your own as api. But it's different from gpt store

[2024-01-18, 16:01:33] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: Yeah, but I should be able to access something I bought in GPT store via APIs , what’s the difference if I access via Web Ui or API.

[2024-01-18, 16:21:33] Sreechand Tavva: If I understand you correctly, what you're saying is, if I'm using something I bought using GPT store, I should also be able to access it via an API. 

I'll break this down, as a user I want to have API access to a custom GPT (which have some instructions/prompts and other API access). 

The only way to do it is to have the assistant and the custom GPT in the same account.

So the gpt maker can make it available through an assistant, but the gpt maker has to recreate the assistant  with your API key in your account, and you will bear the costs for API access, not just sessions but token and data retrieval as well.

The other case would be for the gpt make to create the assistant, but that would mean they have to share their API key and no gpt maker would do that. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-18, 16:29:04] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: Yes, you understood the specs correctly. I infer that it may not be possible today.  However, it should be there in the pipeline (however long term) 🙂 

I see a Custom GPT like a Header/Plugin File, someone created it, sold it, I added it to my account, paid for it , did the handshake of purchase to establish legitimacy (Like a WP Theme / Paid Plugin) 

Now after that Handshake is done,  That Free/OneTime Paid/ Subscribe Paid? GPT works the same for me via WebUI. 

I can access GPT via APIs by giving my access Keys. 

I ideally should be able to access everything added to my account, it can be a layered API call from 1 to another to check if the Subscription validity still exist.
[2024-01-18, 16:29:27] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: I have faith it’ll come as the space develops.
[2024-01-18, 16:30:08] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: Access Front end should be agnostic of what is available to Access.
[2024-01-18, 16:40:07] Sreechand Tavva: Ahh! Got it. Right now customGPTs are being built for people to interact (and not APIs) but I agree with you, an API requirement might bubble up as well. And when it does, OpenAI will need to figure a way to bundle API access to a plus account as well. 

What I'm wondering is
1. What is the value add that a customGPT user getting from it for it to be accessed via an API that they cannot recreate.
2. If they do find value, how would it be monetized, considering customGPTs might be monetized based on usage and not just a one-time fee.
3. If it is a one-time fee, will it incentivize them to create customGPTs.

I like how you're approaching it, the way you've articulated is the ideal way I would like to be a consumer of customGPTs, getting a hassle free billing for all the customGPTs I've used, all the API access I've done along with my Plus subscription.
[2024-01-18, 16:56:35] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: Here’s a simple use case: 

Lets say I want to build an Mobile Image APP, based on DallE, now several PromptFU ninjas create custom GPTs that excel for X, Y, Z usecase (Anime / Pixar Effects / Typography Posters / Line Art Cartoons ) , which all look great on Instagram. 

I’d wish my app to access these GPTs and give output to end user. 

I am an App developer in this case, who doesnt want to do the PromptFu everytime GPT/DallE upgrades, and would rather focus on what I know (App UX and Marketing) 

Its easier for me to Add more GPTs and let these guys maintain their GPTs as everything upgrades.

[2024-01-19, 00:19:06] Pratyush Choudhury: Will the next big model release be OSS? Why/Why not?
[2024-01-19, 00:25:25] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: llama3 is going to be OSS, not sure after that.
[2024-01-19, 00:31:14] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Just realized this is $18B for just GPUs.
[2024-01-19, 01:05:25] Arko C | xylem.ai: Why do you think they will stop post that?

We have been thinking about these and feel that by 2026 most companies who need to use custom/fine-tuned/pre-trained LLMs, would have started using it and it would only become a function of making it better with more data as the tech becomes commoditized and you get good datasets that you can train on top of? This is largely to understand how the demand curve of OSS LLMs will be.

^ this is only for LLMs. Not image, voice, video, etc. The work on gen AI will keep happening for this entire decade. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-19, 01:09:45] Pratyush Choudhury: Didn’t get - could you elaborate?
[2024-01-19, 01:10:18] Pratyush Choudhury: Mistral has different incentives to ship an OSS model vs Meta, I’m not sure if you factored that into the thought process (?)
[2024-01-19, 01:11:48] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Meta models will be OSS until you become large enough to compete with them on consumer reach, which is not true OSS.
[2024-01-19, 01:12:22] Pratyush Choudhury: And why do you that’s the case?
[2024-01-19, 01:13:14] Pratyush Choudhury: Perplexity uses Llama, might one day potentially compete?

[2024-01-19, 01:15:00] Arko C | xylem.ai: Yes yes I did

The above text is to understand how others here perceive the demand of OSS LLMs to be.

Will in a couple of years, whoever is supposed to own their weights, ends up doing so and then keeps training on top of it?

Or

do we end up getting really good datasets that can be used to train good base models as the infrastructure and compute side of things gets commoditised.

Basically will you need good OSS base models after a point?

Idk if this ended up confusing the conversation even more 😂😅 ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-19, 01:16:00] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: We may soon hear about Perplexity and Llama2 license limitations. Pplx may try to move to the mistral in that case.

[2024-01-19, 19:00:14] ~ Sachin Kalsi: *a question about using RAG*

I have a lot of business news about different companies, and I want to create a RAG model for it. It generally works well, but for questions like 'Has Sam Altman been fired from OpenAI?', older news about him being let go is showing up. I want to prioritize recent news that says 'Sam was let go but later OpenAI retained him.'  

I've tried deduplication and sorting based on recent news, but the similarity of old, outdated news is still higher than the recent ones.   Any suggestions?
[2024-01-19, 19:02:22] Ravi Theja: are recent news getting retrieved in top 10 in first place?
[2024-01-19, 19:04:03] ~ Sachin Kalsi: nope. its somewhere around 18th-20th
[2024-01-19, 19:05:28] Ravi Theja: a naive approach is to keep topk higher and then sort by date and pick the top 3?
[2024-01-19, 19:06:00] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Try using pplx-online model?

[2024-01-19, 19:07:12] Ravi Theja: whats the issue with this? is it because LLM is seeing older news data as well in top3?
[2024-01-19, 19:07:19] ~ Sachin Kalsi: not tried this. but the problem is more on retirever side right ?
[2024-01-19, 19:09:04] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: It is. Just directly using this might be cheaper though.
[2024-01-19, 19:09:22] ~ Anjineyulu: May be we should bucket continously occuring events in recent window times and then sort it
[2024-01-19, 19:10:22] ~ Sachin Kalsi: out of 3,  say 2 news  would be talking about sam being fired and 1 news talks about sam altman new plans (something like this).

so summary wrt question says "yes, sam altman got fired"
[2024-01-19, 19:10:37] ~ Anjineyulu: Like also we can bucket based on sentiment gradients of a window
[2024-01-19, 19:11:56] ~ Sachin Kalsi: tracking events for all business related news could be challenging. But I got you. tjhanks for this
[2024-01-19, 19:12:44] ~ Anjineyulu: Like bucket recent into category 1,like that say we have many buckets each bucket has a date range.Thus transforms date index sort is the go to
[2024-01-19, 19:13:44] Ravi Theja: okay you mean,

source1: Sam got fired news
source2: sam got fired news
source3: sam new plans news

so as per this context, you are giving information about sam got fired news but not sam returned back. With the help of sam new plans, it should automatically reason that sam got back which can be abit tougher task I guess 🤔
[2024-01-19, 19:14:06] ~ Sachin Kalsi: yes, but latency might be a problem
[2024-01-19, 19:15:46] ~ Anjineyulu: When the naive way can't add bussiess value,why not?.But u can always distill this idea
[2024-01-19, 19:17:02] ~ Sachin Kalsi: yes, you are right !

but say if you want to solve , what it takes? checking the perplexity/ Google makes me wonder, 'How can one build this?'"
thanks for the input
[2024-01-19, 19:17:32] ~ Anjineyulu: For example for fields like ai things are so fast so bucket may be every day into 1 😅,but other domais need not be.
[2024-01-19, 19:18:23] ~ Sachin Kalsi: yes, agred. It will work for this scenario but for others (where there is no problem ), latency might hit.

but I value your inputs. Thanks

[2024-01-21, 19:32:02] Akash Tandon: If someone here can share a take on broader significance of the paper, will be great to hear.
[2024-01-21, 20:18:04] Arvind N Generative AI Group: - While the symbolic (gofai) and connectionist schools of thought have had their successful bull runs, it's at the intersection of both,  usefulness emerges.
- LLMs are currently known for their creative writing as opposed to their factfulness and deterministic solvers have the exact opposite property
- The brilliant insight in the paper is to take the best of both worlds to attack a tiny sliver of highly complex problems, namely IMO geometry problems and see if the automated method can (a) beat human experts within competition window of 4.5 hrs (b) consistently solve problems that are fully traceable and explainable
- The core contribution is what Trieu calls "pulling rabbits out of the hat" i.e. a statement that usually sounds like "suppose,..." Or "let's consider the corollary..." Etc. If the LLM can spit out a useful rabbit, the solver can then work out the remaining steps. And if it fails we can keep iterating until we luck out. Unlike chess or go, we have many many attempts here - only the ticking clock has to be adhered to
- so, broadly it is a remarkable achievement in bridging the 2 worlds of AI where the NN brings imagination and the gofai method brings precision. When you have both, useful things become suddenly possible

Are you Part of the Beta program for WhatsApp?
[2024-01-22, 00:17:02] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Folks have been running ad-hoc meetups and hang out. Some of us are meeting on the 9th when I'm in Bangalore. It's no agenda community hang out with the ‘Buy your own Beer’ setup. Last time on short notice, more than 25+ folks showed up. This time, we may cross 50, so working on headcount before finalizing a place. 
Organizing monthly dedicated meetups for the group may put a burden on admins in the current setup.

[2024-01-22, 13:14:06] Vetrivel PS: Why has this been the only question that most are asking 😕

- r1 just may take us to a place without distracting social media apps, at least that's what I guess is the focus to have a device without SM 😀

- Also the interface through voice and a 360° camera seems amazing, let's see how things go once the users start using the r1 devices and provide real time feedback 😎 

r1 is selling because of the price it's offered at, if it can provide good value - then these devices are gonna be everywhere 🤩
[2024-01-22, 13:31:48] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: https://cmu-codegen.github.io/s2024/

this seems to involve lot of papers related to code generation using AI/co-pilots and llms and work around them. Good compilation.
[2024-01-22, 14:59:47] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: To me, rabbit r1 seems more hype than substance
[2024-01-22, 15:21:03] Atharwa Sheth ITC: $10M in sales for hype is not bad at all
[2024-01-22, 15:22:33] Anshul Bhide Replit: plus they get a free working capital to manufacture
[2024-01-22, 15:22:34] Anshul Bhide Replit: they apparently just sold out their 5th batch too
[2024-01-22, 15:24:13] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Can Rabbit r1 interact with other people's r1s on your behalf?
[2024-01-22, 15:27:50] Vetrivel PS: This idea is nice 😅
[2024-01-22, 15:35:51] ~ Ganaraj: In terms of Rabbit R1, I think they should have launched with a phone with an LLM capable of interacting with multiple "capabilities". Create a store for different providers to create "capabilities" and form an eco-system around it. I feeel that would have been a better solution overall than what they have done currently.
[2024-01-22, 15:37:20] Vetrivel PS: Won't that be easier to copy for other bigger companies ? ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-01-22, 16:42:38] Sparsh Chutiya Agarwal Nova GenZ: Does anyone have good recommendations for cheap & reliable speech to text model?

AssemblyAI is also $12 per million tokens which is very expensive
[2024-01-22, 16:46:42] Ravi Theja: https://www.gladia.io/ not sure about pricing

https://monsterapi.ai/playground?model=speech2text
[2024-01-22, 17:53:03] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Speech to Text? Depends on the language. Whisper is cheap for Western. Azure, GCP and Bhashini for Indic.
[2024-01-22, 17:55:02] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Also depends on the application type, is it realtime or offline?
[2024-01-22, 18:00:35] Dilip Ittyera CogniSwitch Founder: You can also try our Llama Pach at https://llamahub.ai/l/llama_packs-cogniswitch_agent

Does anyone have API access for Azure GPT-4? We have applied but it is taking some time to get approval from Microsoft. We have one demo today where we want to try out Azure GPT-4. OpenAI GPT-4 is very slow right now. 
Thank you.
[2024-01-22, 18:43:56] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: DeepGram is also pretty great. It is cheapest in benchmark to other speech to text and performance is really good.

[2024-01-22, 18:49:55] Sparsh Chutiya Agarwal Nova GenZ: Yeah we checked that out
For us to stream 1 million tokens with that, it would still cost us $8 per million tokens (more than the LLM itself)

But still its the cheapest, yes
[2024-01-22, 19:35:51] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Folks, which benchmarking datasets are u using for testing ur finetunes ?
Do u do a test/train split ?
Or are there generally accepted benchmark datasets that people use?
[2024-01-22, 19:47:39] Vamshi: Will be nice to trace the roots of the efforts to unify if anyone has that perspective.

I used to casually follow Smolenskys work on tensor product representations, the stuff that won him the Rumelhart prize for his attempt at unifying symbolic and connectionist representations.

But don’t have the whole thread, or an article that does a take on the past vs the state of the art with pure empirical and emergent representations.
[2024-01-22, 19:49:52] Vamshi: https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/000437029090007M
[2024-01-22, 19:50:08] Vamshi: Very dated, posing for historic value ..
[2024-01-22, 19:51:40] Vamshi: I don’t know of any similar work on extracting emergent type systems from LLMs, but I know that some of the work on mechanistic interpretability attempts this.

[2024-01-22, 20:32:47] ~ Ganaraj: How many of you have switched to using perplexity ? Is it now at the stage where it can be a full on replacement for Google ?
[2024-01-22, 20:34:29] Pratyush Choudhury: Do we even need to completely switch to Perplexity?
[2024-01-22, 20:34:34] Sparsh Chutiya Agarwal Nova GenZ: What happens when every app filled with traffic offers search?
Or better yet, assistant agents delivering more personalized search?
[2024-01-22, 20:34:41] Pratyush Choudhury: Why can’t it be used for say 20% of the time?
[2024-01-22, 20:38:27] Suhas Motwani: Most biz models in this space till date are ad driven (Bing, Google, etc) - in this case 20% means proportional lesser ad $ 
Also here % I’m guessing is # of times rather complete switch — I’d say 20% is still quite a bit
With Perplexity Pro etc subscription biz is quite a difference (maybe data play as well) — although my guess is with social and search so far ad $ far outweigh subscription
‎[2024-01-22, 20:40:33] Suhas Motwani: ‎image omitted
[2024-01-22, 20:41:09] ~ Atishay: 90% of the searches that happen on the internet are stuff like

“Aus Open Djokovic” or “Ind vs Eng”

For such kinds of searches perplexity is not required nor cost efficient.

it’s unfair to dunk on Perplexity (or bing) because of that.
[2024-01-22, 20:41:39] Pratyush Choudhury: I’d written about why I think 5-10% of search traffic moving away from Google being a big dent here in the group itself, probably 2 weeks back
‎[2024-01-22, 20:43:37] Suhas Motwani: ‎image omitted
[2024-01-22, 20:44:13] ~ Atishay: I mean like saying Bing is not moving the needle because of AI is not fair because 90% of searches don’t need AI
[2024-01-22, 20:44:33] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Yet
[2024-01-22, 20:44:58] Suhas Motwani: Fair
[2024-01-22, 20:45:32] Suhas Motwani: Def is. Getting to 5% is huge (see Bing %) and uphill
[2024-01-22, 20:45:42] Saurabh Karn Nyai: Think about combining downstream tasks for which the search was needed in the first place. Once we start collapsing those things into single clicks almost all search would need to be AI augmented.
[2024-01-22, 20:45:43] Suhas Motwani: That’s the point here^
[2024-01-22, 22:03:18] ~ Mrigesh Parashar: Is there any llm that comprehends Sanskrit or Awadhi proficiently?
[2024-01-22, 22:13:17] ~ Ganaraj: ChatGPT works well for Sanskrit. I have tried Mistral and Llama 7B and their performance is not upto the mark on the same task. I have not tried for awadhi at all, so cant comment on it.
[2024-01-22, 22:32:09] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Agreed, finding the right information during LLM workflows and pulling search results for people are two very different things
[2024-01-22, 22:47:14] Sparsh Chutiya Agarwal Nova GenZ: Whatsapp, imessage, voice assistants, twitter, reddit etc
[2024-01-22, 22:49:35] Suhas Motwani: All of these you’re saying will possibly have search functionality like google/perplexity? 🤔
[2024-01-22, 22:55:09] Sparsh Chutiya Agarwal Nova GenZ: Perplexity 

Like for older people, it’s much easier to take knowledge from a bot on WhatsApp 

Its also much faster to do on whatsapp
[2024-01-22, 23:09:54] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: 100% 

Google Search volume has been declining, and same has been rising on YouTube etc. People prefer to now listen /  Watch through a search than “Read” the answer in a wall of text. 

Before AI results on Google, for the last year or so, Google was actually taking you to the part of the page via a custom deep anchor link which matched your query.
[2024-01-22, 23:10:45] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: As more and more “delightful” answers become accessible over API, what stops each and every popular app/interface to integrate this.
[2024-01-22, 23:11:27] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: We already have Refrigerators with TV built in, and other smart gadgets, this is next step.
[2024-01-22, 23:12:39] ~ Abhishek Thakkar: You ask your Mixer Grinder, what should go in Coconut Chutney, it’ll tell you. It may also have an integrated sensor to tell you how much salt to add.

InstantId code available on GitHub now.No need for LoRA fine tuning to get customised images using InstantID.

I can see this becoming more wide spread where cost effective image generation is needed.Finetuned LoRAs will have to get more specialised,to justify cost of finetuning.

One part im most unhappy with is, it keeps making spelling errors while displaying text in image.

[2024-01-25, 10:10:48] ~ Amit Timalsina: We have a chat application. I want to add suggestions for follow up questions.
There are two types of follow up questions. 1) Here's how you can connect your investment accounts. (question: How are my investment's doing? response_from_agent: You haven't connected your investment accounts.) 2) What are my top performing investments? (related to the last question).

How should i handle both types?
for 1) i am thinking of creating a vectordb with question and storing the url for the question in metadata.
for 2) I can either use llm to get me next question using prev_question+prev_response. else i can create a vectordb of questions.

Am i thinking this correctly? Any feedbacks? Much appreciated.
[2024-01-25, 10:12:53] Jayanth Generative AI WhatsApp Group: You can maybe try semantic routing. This is something which I'm exploring currently and is really useful.
[2024-01-25, 10:17:30] ~ Amit Timalsina: Thanks. I can see some place else where I this would be great. But for this I think semantic is itself sufficient; no routing needed.

[2024-01-25, 14:03:02] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Along with the model, we also share the instruction tuning datasets to enable further research for IndicLLMs. We rely on human-curated, license-friendly instruction-tuned datasets to build "Airavata." We do not use data generated from proprietary models like GPT-4 etc. We think this is a more sustainable way of building instruction-tuned models at scale for most Indic languages, where relying on distilled data from commercial models would increase costs and restrict their free usage in downstream applications due to licensing restrictions.

[2024-01-25, 19:13:22] Abhishek Mishra: got stuck with lora adapter merging due to difference in architecture, so running the entire thing today with sentence transformers architecture with a mistral base that's already ported to sentence transformers architecture

[2024-01-25, 19:56:14] Azhan Mohammed Generative AI WhatsApp Group: The optimal solution is to retrieve a person based on a query of skills.
[2024-01-25, 19:57:20] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Have you tried creating synthetic dataset for this and training your own embedding model? Should be automated and fast enough
[2024-01-25, 19:58:18] Dhruv Anand: You should start with some example pairs that you would expect to be close together, but are not.

Ideally the general embeddings should suffice. If not, you can fine-tune the embeddings on your data
[2024-01-25, 19:58:25] Ravi Theja: is it possible to share design of your system? ideally based on metadata as well this should work
[2024-01-25, 19:58:28] Azhan Mohammed Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yeah, finetuning could be one approach, but the problem becomes that I will have to create multiple instances for similar professions, skills and interests, and even then a lot of them could be left out.

Thanks for the help
[2024-01-25, 20:44:32] ~ Ganaraj: If your data is in json do you even need embeddings to query to data ? Is there a use case where the same data (skills?) is queried differently from how it is stored ?

[2024-01-26, 00:43:22] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Yeah this is interesting, means we can have a backup of Cohere which has same dimensions for cases where you don't store in vector db.

[2024-01-26, 02:53:20] Shashank Generative AI Group: am i getting this right?

by using the expensive bigger embedding model (v3-large) WITH shortening you could reduce total spend? or almost equal.
total = vectordb + embedding API cost

shortened v3-large can be 256 or 1024 dimensions. v/s the older ada v2 with 1536 dimensions.

so less storage cost. and API cost diff ain't much 
v3 - $0.00013 / 1k tokens vs 
v2 - $0.00010 / 1k tokens

[2024-01-26, 17:07:42] ~ Sandya Saravanan: is there any offering which offers it as a managed service on a on-premise hw appliance?
[2024-01-26, 17:08:04] ~ Sandya Saravanan: Not on cloud, but in house,

[2024-01-26, 17:17:31] ~ Sandya Saravanan: Thanks. Will connect thru DM once I do my home work. This is for a corporate client who is looking for a managed RAG service - likely biased towards ISV offerings rather than startups. Will reach out.
[2024-01-26, 17:20:48] Arko C | xylem.ai: I think an addition on the labour side should also be that there are very few engineers going very deep. There’s a massive gap in talent. And the ones who do, they are far and few and would ofc want to make the salary that a remote job can pay. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-26, 17:23:48] Arko C | xylem.ai: (also the engineering culture within the company)

Dukaan has cracked this really well (not first hand opinion) ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-26, 17:26:27] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: OpenAI introduced smaller AI models named embeddings. Described as "sequences of numbers that represent concepts within content," embeddings support applications using retrieval-augmented generation. This type of AI retrieves information from a database rather than generating answers independently. OpenAI launched two variants of these models - text-embedding-3-small and the more robust text-embedding-3-large - both of which are now accessible to users.
[2024-01-26, 17:30:07] ~ Ganaraj: Can you explain this a bit more ? What is distinct about the Dukaan engineering culture? Just want to learn about it so we can all emulate it if possible
[2024-01-26, 17:35:18] Ojasvi Yadav: I'm curious to hear this take too ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-26, 17:38:31] Nirant K: Cheaper isn't always true for India fwiw. Import duties and small market. Talent pool is also an inch deep, mile wide.
[2024-01-26, 17:39:36] Nirant K: If you're selling globally, the conversation is different but ideally no experienced and excellent engineer would work for less than London or Berlin pay in BLR.

[2024-01-26, 17:41:46] Arko C | xylem.ai: See, one disclaimer is that it’s not a first hand opinion

Have heard aspiring backend engineers admire Subhash and the work of their team quite a lot.

If it’s the contrary at large, then again, prolly wrong info cause as I mentioned, not really first hand.

Even this was impressive and had a few folks really appreciate this: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vFxQyZX84Ro

But again, not first hand opinion. So if anyone knows it deeper, do share
[2024-01-26, 17:42:42] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: As a talented software engineer, salaries in india are at par with folks in almost all parts of the world except US in my opinion.

[2024-01-26, 17:44:40] ~ Atishay: From what’s I’ve seen would say not *at par* but definitely around 30% less at max. Also, it’s not fair to compare top x% vs median.
[2024-01-26, 17:45:05] Nirant K: Context matters, yes. 

I'm inclined to believe that there's always a mispricing in talent markets -- but this is the most efficient talent market I've seen in my short career.
[2024-01-26, 17:45:20] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Aligned sir 🫡
[2024-01-26, 17:46:03] Nirant K: Fair, if I compare Krutrim to Mistral -- one of them looks overhyped 😂

[2024-01-26, 23:12:03] Priyesh OnFinance: my idea was to put this into GPT ask it to repeat the same sentence as is and add up log probs to see the probability of this being GPT gened
[2024-01-27, 05:27:31] Nilesh Agarwal Inferless: ‎This message was deleted.
[2024-01-27, 09:23:37] Nirant K: Mostly marketing at this point imho. Most 30B models are smarter than I ever will be

But in the general context, this is a longest common subsequence problem — where you match against prior generated media, and you assume you've a large-ish coverage of that

This is why most plagiarism checking tools had a "free plan for academia" — you're donating your writing to them for future plagiarism check
[2024-01-27, 09:28:52] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Folks, how do unaligned models behave in the context of RAG systems as embedding / question answering models? Are there examples or case studies of this, esp with open source models for both embedding and Q&A?
[2024-01-27, 09:45:05] Saurav Akaike: I see, I wonder how many students are getting expelled due to such marketing heavy UX. 
My friend from Harvard has a committee hearing because they feel her assignment is AI generated and given my understanding/opinion is the same as yours- it boils my blood.

I think it's also possible that they try to find the source data over the internet for specific sentences and tag them as training data.
[2024-01-27, 10:00:18] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I agree they fail at the slightest use of a rephraser.
However there are certain phrases that are so open AI LLM that are there other places also, that serve as better indicators
[2024-01-27, 10:13:08] Nirant K: Yeah, these edge cases are often a cause of lot of heart ache.

Edge case of these from my own undergrad:

I had a published paper which got indexed by the plagiarism checker, when I submitted an extension to that as my course project — it was marked as plagiarism. It was quite messy, and I had to quote my own work "verbatim" to get it skipped by the plagiarism checker. There was no human e.g Professor or TA in the loop who cared.
[2024-01-27, 10:14:16] Nirant K: Yeah, some text smells like GPT generated but it's quite easy to grill someone over an hour and confirm if they got the topic or not. A fine-tuned Mixtral on my own writing and source material will prolly not even have those "smells"
[2024-01-27, 10:36:54] Saurav Akaike: O man! The amount of useless energy spent on drafting accusation statements is unreal- leave alone the trauma that comes with it.
But, thanks for sharing your experience.

[2024-01-27, 12:34:08] ~ Amit Timalsina: How important is it to define what the output will look like from a tool (that is used by agent)? Currently i am defining the output for all my custom tools. But i don't see the native tools like wikipedia define them. I am spending too much tokens on defining the exact output schema.

What do you guys think?
[2024-01-27, 12:40:42] Priyank Agrawal: Anyone who has used Krisp SDK (in code not as an app) for background noise cancellation??

[2024-01-27, 21:14:01] ~ Rohan: Have you tried any OCR models?
[2024-01-27, 21:17:40] ~ Krishna Iyengar: There are Text detection models used in OCR - East/Craft. Mmocr has dbnet which works very well out of the box - https://mmocr.readthedocs.io/en/latest/textdet_models.html#dbnet
[2024-01-27, 21:18:10] Harsh Gupta Felvin: Curious what is the usecase? OCR tools gives coordinates of the bounding box. Tessaract has that, also Surva (https://github.com/VikParuchuri/surya) appears to be really good
[2024-01-27, 21:19:47] Narendranath Gogineni: Yes, except requirement is not limited to text, also other objects like drop downs
[2024-01-27, 21:20:07] Anmol Sonthalia GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: If Apple decides to use GPT instead of creating their own model, it suggests they might be in a decline, not as competitive as before.

[2024-01-28, 11:13:27] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: so here, you have to think about how will you map certain query (user questions) to a base prompt (may be you can train nlu intent detection model for this). That will be first point. and then designing system in way it generalizes and captures as much as 80 to 90% of incoming queries reasonably is the next step.

[2024-01-28, 11:49:22] MD Fazal GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: Inhave 2 friends working in the Tech team in Dukaan. One has worked for 2 years and left, the other is still continuing. 

First of all they don't shy in building things of their own. There is a lot of libraries and packages that they have built for their own purposes. 

Have really optimized on performance. Dukaan now is better at request and operational latency than Shopify.

They have left the cloud and gone metal. 

A lot of freedom to teams. You get your objective as literature, the rest team members decide. So the decision is not top down rather bottom up. 

And a lot more small small stuff that they have dome which has truly made their engineering culture as one of the best in BLR.
[2024-01-28, 11:52:29] Nirant K: As a reminder for the wider reader, the "best" has different definitions for different people, and even for the same person — varies over time and situation.

In general, I'm inclined to believe that all engineering culture converges to gross margins and founders/leaders. So always weary of working with low gross margin/J-curve businesses before inflection.

Why do people waste some much in openai credits only to conclude that LLMs are next token predictors
[2024-01-29, 01:53:11] Priyesh OnFinance: *2AM Sunday Thoughts:* Super alignment will work for the same reason LoRA works. LoRA weights which are much smaller the original generator model are successfully able to "adapt" the input data at various layers to change output distribution.

PS: Obviously there is a very detailed reason and theoretical reason why super alignment makes sense but this seemed the most Occam's razor to me. ‎<This message was edited>

https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/speech-to-text -- this may be the api also they are using.
[2024-01-29, 11:07:56] Paras Chopra Wingify: I don’t think this is the case

I’m asking text to voice too. It sounds natural
[2024-01-29, 11:08:10] Paras Chopra Wingify: Eleven labs comes close to it but it’s expensive so wondering what they use
[2024-01-29, 11:11:06] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This is great work @919740079909, zero shot PoT is intriguing 🙏
[2024-01-29, 11:12:04] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/text-to-speech/voice-options TTS options tryout demos they have two models tts and tts-hd
[2024-01-29, 11:13:30] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: @919868221372 their docs say this - *The TTS model generally follows the Whisper model in terms of language support.* Whisper supports the following languages and performs well despite the current voices being optimized for English:

Afrikaans, Arabic, Armenian, Azerbaijani, Belarusian, Bosnian, Bulgarian, Catalan, Chinese, Croatian, Czech, Danish, Dutch, English, Estonian, Finnish, French, Galician, German, Greek, Hebrew, Hindi, Hungarian, Icelandic, Indonesian, Italian, Japanese, Kannada, Kazakh, Korean, Latvian, Lithuanian, Macedonian, Malay, Marathi, Maori, Nepali, Norwegian, Persian, Polish, Portuguese, Romanian, Russian, Serbian, Slovak, Slovenian, Spanish, Swahili, Swedish, Tagalog, Tamil, Thai, Turkish, Ukrainian, Urdu, Vietnamese, and Welsh.

You can generate spoken audio in these languages by providing the input text in the language of your choice.
[2024-01-29, 11:13:39] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: They have limited number of voices, and it won't be difficult for OpenAI level the company to ship these limited model weights with the app in-built.
[2024-01-29, 11:13:42] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: not sure if they are using some modification of algo there etc.
[2024-01-29, 11:14:27] Paras Chopra Wingify: Thanks  - wasn’t aware

It’s not ios

I just tried and ios text to speech sucks
[2024-01-29, 11:15:19] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: expected, Apple are still getting their act around on different accents I believe.
[2024-01-29, 11:16:06] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: The latency they have right now and they are streaming the response and generating speech, means weight should be in the App. I dont think they have web version, or they will have to call APIs.
[2024-01-29, 11:16:29] Paras Chopra Wingify: It feels they’re streaming audio
[2024-01-29, 11:16:40] Varshul Dubverse: Did some evals a while back. Def not what the claim is. Doesn’t work too well in Indic languages. Plus English is only US English. Costing is 10x cheaper than elevenlabs though.
[2024-01-29, 11:17:58] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yes, that is possible, too. More like generating every sentence and streaming it.
[2024-01-29, 11:18:02] Varshul Dubverse: True, which is why it’s patchy sometimes. Model streaming similar to LLMs.
[2024-01-29, 11:18:04] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yeah for sure, expected that TTS for indic languages is not accurate from open ai or any other companies, google included. English and European languages are easier to get first. I think Hindi development will come soon from Google etc and then other 22 languages will generally follow in time.
[2024-01-29, 11:19:46] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I wish I have enough time and resources to do that, just not the priority right now. Maybe Bhashini folks can improve their TTS models and open-source it.
[2024-01-29, 11:20:19] Paras Chopra Wingify: Good text to speech and reverse in Indic languages will be game changer as our literacy rates are low
[2024-01-29, 11:20:36] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: yes, hoping that too. that will be a game changer for community and India.
[2024-01-29, 11:21:04] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Seems like you have never tried Kissan.ai we have been doing since March 2023.
[2024-01-29, 11:23:41] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: First to being end to end voice conversation in most Indic languages. It is just that what we have right now is working well, so prioritizing other parts of the business. Relying on open source community to improve speech models for now.
[2024-01-29, 11:25:37] ~ Ankit Sharma: nub ques: any blogs on running gguf models on google colab pro??
[2024-01-29, 11:26:08] Varshul Dubverse: We would have some good news to share on the open source TTS soon. Will can more details in DM to prevent information overload.
[2024-01-29, 11:26:15] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: check if that gguf model is on hf - if it is loaded to hf, it is super easier
[2024-01-29, 12:57:51] Jayanth Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Has anyone tried to benchmark embeddings with OpenAI's latest embedding models against proprietary data?

[2024-01-30, 06:55:36] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Text understanding with hashtag#LLMs is useful but not enough for scientific understanding and discovery. In chemistry, in addition to text, chemical structure is essential to determine the properties of molecules.

We have created the first multimodal text-chemical structure model: MoleculeSTM. It has an aligned latent space of both modalities. This allows the users to provide free-form text instructions to create molecules with arbitrary sets of properties.

This enables zero-shot text-guided molecule editing (lead optimization) without the need to fine-tune the model for each new specification.

Paper: bit.ly/4736BPH 
Code: bit.ly/4877YOS 

The core idea of MoleculeSTM is to align the chemical structure and textual description modalities using contrastive pretraining. The pivotal advantage of such alignment is its capacity to introduce a new paradigm of LLM for drug discovery: by fully utilizing the open vocabulary and compositionality attributes of natural language.

[2024-01-30, 09:12:36] Priyank Agrawal: Wait what?

Isn't the whole point of Transformers was to go away from LSTMs to be able to do parallel compute and thus train on large dataset.

Why are we moving backwards 😅😅😅😅

Can someone please explain???

[2024-01-30, 10:38:36] Nirant K: RWKV is more parallel than pure RNNs and have lower inference costs than Transformers. It's an attempt to make a tradeoff between higher train and lower inference cost. The challenge -- even with this very hyped release is that these models are quite bad. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-01-30, 11:03:59] Nirant K: Unfair to compare frameworks to compilers xD
[2024-01-30, 11:06:29] Vedant Trivedi Sequoia: understand it is at different level of abstraction & more optimizations under the hood, but want to understand whether it is finally able to help build genAI apps more reliably / easily vs not using it at all.
[2024-01-30, 11:07:21] Nirant K: Not really meant for app or production usage
[2024-01-30, 11:08:52] Nirant K: ‎You deleted this message.
[2024-01-30, 11:09:27] Nirant K: DSPy is closer to how you'd think about PyTorch for deep learning.

[2024-01-30, 11:13:02] Nirant K: LC for sure. Despite the limitations it had at least till August 2023. I'm quite surprised that something so brittle had such serious adoption. Has forced me to rethink how software has been built and will be built going forward
[2024-01-30, 11:13:18] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: @919550164716 any thoughts on this?
[2024-01-30, 11:13:52] Pratyush Choudhury: A lot of adoption of Gen AI last year wasn’t serious maybe?
[2024-01-30, 11:14:21] Vedant Trivedi Sequoia: they provide managed service for production via Langsmith, is that correct?
[2024-01-30, 11:14:54] Nirant K: Au contraire — GenAI adoption has largely been by serious players. IBM had the highest ranked blog on Google on RAG, Youtube video and Tiktok video.
[2024-01-30, 11:15:00] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: Langsmith for monitoring, managed service is Langserve afaik
[2024-01-30, 11:15:36] Pratyush Choudhury: Haha… you & I are talking the same thing just using different terminology 

Folks like IBM will likely not use LC/LI in prod
[2024-01-30, 11:20:42] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: The adaptation was mostly due to folks trying out PoCs or pilots, it doesn't make sense to use these frameworks in serious production.
[2024-01-30, 11:25:15] Shashwat TDC: As a builder yourself, what do you think are limitations @19377081307 just curious about your perspective from US-market from where a lot of this tech is emerging.

[2024-01-30, 11:34:04] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Wow. This can be controversial and may need a whole session with open discussion. I have been running RAG before these frameworks and always found them too heavy for latency and cost for production at scale. Like why would anyone use Django in production where it can be done with FastAPIs, or even Go or Rust?
[2024-01-30, 11:34:38] Priyesh OnFinance: Aligned 100%
[2024-01-30, 11:34:40] Nirant K: And yet, Django powers Instagram :)
[2024-01-30, 11:34:51] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: All the folks I knew who started last year along with us, Julius and other folks, Noone is a big fan of frameworks.

[2024-01-30, 11:36:43] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: So many startups have been died under technical debt inspiring from the Instagram example 😂. Django is good and we use it for other applications but not GenAI copilot  😬
[2024-01-30, 11:37:19] Shashwat TDC: Haha apologies for putting u on the spot. 🙏
[2024-01-30, 11:38:10] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: But this frameworks are necessary for rapid adaptation and building pilots to convince customers and higher management.
[2024-01-30, 11:38:38] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: interesting convo - part of my work is to build a Javascript SDK for the usability...but cross compile to a WASM runtime for performance.
[2024-01-30, 11:40:24] Prakash Sankar Harbor: I think it's hard to adopt frameworks when they are so young
[2024-01-30, 11:40:25] Prakash Sankar Harbor: so you don't know if you're just going to throw it away
[2024-01-30, 11:40:31] Prakash Sankar Harbor: or if they are going to survive
[2024-01-30, 11:40:38] Prakash Sankar Harbor: plus it's not like the basic APIs are that bad
[2024-01-30, 11:41:07] Nirant K: The implicit journey of every framework is to get good enough that you can build things with it, and then get so large that existing folks don't churn. This leads to laggard adopters always wrestling with more complexity than useful. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-30, 11:41:24] Prakash Sankar Harbor: A lot of technical choices at startups are driven by your ability to hire
[2024-01-30, 11:41:29] Prakash Sankar Harbor: not by whether it's the best thing to do
[2024-01-30, 11:42:01] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: 75-80% of folks implementing RAG using these frameworks have no clue about vector embedding etc. Frameworks are easier to copy from examples than hard coding
[2024-01-30, 11:42:54] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yes, there is money to be made there.
[2024-01-30, 11:43:28] Nirant K: Fair, but does the app dev really need to even care what an embedding is? Isn't the whole promise of progress that everything becomes "seamless"?
[2024-01-30, 11:44:58] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Exactly, this is good for first step for pilots or management demos. And companies are small, it may still work well. When we talk about production, I'm talking like 1+ MAU ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-30, 11:47:04] Rajaswa Patil: Thanks! Will check this out. Function calling fine-tuning for a multi-turn conversational settings seems a very closed topic as of now.

[2024-01-30, 12:23:31] Shruthi Badri: I benchmarked against top open source models on mteb
[2024-01-30, 13:49:40] Nirant K: Yeah, the large is quite good.
[2024-01-30, 13:50:04] Nirant K: Cohere and BGE are still better fwiw on most use cases I'm seeing though
[2024-01-30, 13:52:02] Kartik Mandaville: We were planning to shift to openai large but have to retrain everything :/

[2024-01-30, 13:55:19] Kartik Mandaville: RAG
[2024-01-30, 14:00:06] Nirant K: I believe one can train an encoder to map the Ada to new Large embedding with enough data points. The question is, who will train and release this to OSS 🤣

[2024-01-30, 16:02:17] ~ Amit Timalsina: Really stuck in this problem. Would appreciate your help.

I wrap my chain with RunnableWithMessageHistory. But i am facing the issue of the history going out of max tokens. I want to a ConversationSummaryBufferMemory. I didn't find any resources where these both (RunnableWithMessageHistory, ConversationSummaryBufferMemory) have come together. Can you point me to some resources? ‎<This message was edited>

I know about Triton, Bento and Ray

Also, If you could share the performance improvements, that would help me a lot. 
Thanks
[2024-01-30, 17:44:40] Azhan Mohammed Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Any suggestions on how to stop gpt-3.5 from hallucinating. I have a list of around 1000 tags from which i want to assign relevant ones to a person whose details are provided. Even with temperature set at 0, and explicitly asking to only follow the tags provided, the output contains new tags. Any suggestions on changing prompt, or using a different model which could help?
[2024-01-30, 17:45:48] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: Try finetuning
[2024-01-30, 18:12:52] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: We have a version of mistral trained that does well on a similar task, DM we can figure it out
[2024-01-30, 18:16:39] ~ Bibek: Are there any good metrics to compare pieces of text that are conceptually similar.
[2024-01-30, 18:16:55] ~ Bibek: We tried ROUGE but its of a different kind.
[2024-01-30, 18:27:03] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: Few shot prompting, retrying if it gives invalid tags with a prompt like “these tags are invalid, strictly follow instructions”
[2024-01-30, 18:40:02] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Tough, we use a mix of semantic match and rouge. But as far as text based matching goes Rogue is best
[2024-01-30, 19:10:54] Anil Chandra Naidu Matcha: Which self-hosted vector db would you use if you have to self-host and where do you host it ?
[2024-01-30, 19:12:01] ~ Ganaraj: how big is the data ?
[2024-01-30, 19:12:41] Anil Chandra Naidu Matcha: Not a lot, just for a new project
[2024-01-30, 19:17:41] Bharani GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: Did you try G-eval as recommended by OpenAI? https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/evaluation/how_to_eval_abstractive_summarization
[2024-01-30, 19:37:26] Vamshi: I’ve rarely managed to get my maxed out M1 Max to turn on its fan in 2 years, despite heavy usage, and my first coding request to codellama 70b got it spinning instantly and hot and bothered.

However, the model is surprisingly fast and usable ! Too early to compare, but this feels really good for an open, local model!

I hope 2024 is the year for Personal AI.
[2024-01-30, 19:44:29] ~ Mudit Tyagi: Thanks for sharing. Wondering if you have also tried code llama for code analysis? Use case is to generate Jason for mermaid format flow charts.
[2024-01-30, 19:48:44] Vamshi: Just vanilla coding tasks for now.
I hope people running on an m2 or m3 machine, or a “real” GPU will have better comparisons coming out soon.

Personally I’d like to try it on the one other local setup I have, which is 4090 based.
[2024-01-30, 20:14:14] Nirant K: SQLCoder based on CodeLllama beats GPT4 at the same task
[2024-01-30, 20:14:29] Nirant K: https://twitter.com/rishdotblog/status/1752329471867371659
[2024-01-30, 21:03:00] Rahul Deora: Multiple things can be done like breaking those 1000 tags into a tree and classifying sequentially. Use chatgpt itself to verify the previous predicated tag is within the set, if not then find the closest matching. Use gpt4. Fine tuning. Train another LLM for classification.
[2024-01-30, 21:10:39] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Function calling? If it returns anything else, pydantic object will fail. So you can add a retry on that

[2024-01-30, 22:28:25] ~ Rohan: I suspect there are more players coming. There’s a startup incubating at Sutton Hill Ventures (the Valley’s oldest VC afaik) which is building Copilot grounded in the user’s code base. The goal is to generate insights from your current code base and encourage code reuse (which according to recent studies, copilot has negatively affected). I had a chance to try their beta, it was pretty good.
[2024-01-30, 22:32:41] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Interesting. This falls in the category where there is one winner and runners-up with 15%, unless the target is enterprise.
[2024-01-30, 23:24:53] Lucifer 😎: How is code llama 70b so fast ?
What kind of model serving and inference framework are they using ?
[2024-01-30, 23:30:44] Vamshi: I just also tried this on perplexity now, and it’s really fast there.

Guess running it on my 4090 is out because even the  2-bit quantised won’t fit … ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-01-31, 10:14:30] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: What's your current stack ?
[2024-01-31, 10:15:02] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: And what do you guys use to make sense of natural language use queries?

[2024-01-31, 10:47:21] ~ Soham: Our current stack is typescript and postgres
[2024-01-31, 10:55:29] ~ Soham: We need something that can answer user specific questions. Something like , if the user prompts “what is the status of my order”, it should internally make a db call (or make a api request to the main http service) and fetch the data

[2024-01-31, 11:54:24] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Jokes apart, Data is the key and China has a huge amount of labeled visual data due to mass surveillance meanwhile most Indic languages are considered low resource due to lack of datasets. Long way to go.

[2024-01-31, 12:00:46] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: The irony is that AI will destroy these languages while solving them. Languages and Scripts will be then trapped in the model weights.
[2024-01-31, 12:02:23] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: How is that necessarily destroying them? Not sure I understand
[2024-01-31, 12:07:54] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: More folks we introduce to tech and increase the number of daily interactions, it's Hinglish and Roman script that gets used more than Devanagari or other indic scripts. 
i.e. I studied in Gujarati Medium in India, can't write it even properly after 15 years. Do you think there will be more folks speaking/reading/writing regional languages in 2050 or less?

Also, a topic for the Philosophy group.
[2024-01-31, 12:08:39] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: Ai4Bharat is doing good work for our low resource languages. It's a long way to go but I think we will get there
[2024-01-31, 12:09:09] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Understood
[2024-01-31, 12:10:05] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: The problem is that they are the only ones. Every state government should be budgeting high resources to capture and label their local dialects, in written and audio format.
[2024-01-31, 12:11:02] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: Great point sir
For the most part, the people usually do not have written communication in languages apart from English
[2024-01-31, 12:15:50] C Chaitanya: Just yesterday gave a talk about this to students as part of the Swecha efforts for Telugu. But as you said, better to take this up in the philosophy group.
[2024-01-31, 12:16:10] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: Also one more opinion (please correct me if I am wrong)
There is not much economic incentive for NLP for Indian languages. I love indic NLP and NLP for low resource languages. However I had to shift my focus to other, more general things to increase my hire-ability. There are not as much low resource NLP jobs. Especially in this market. 
 
I feel there would be many like me.
[2024-01-31, 12:16:58] Piyush Makhija: Can we put forward a proposal to the state govt or maybe niti aayog to invest/partner in datasets for local dialects? Sarvam.ai or krutrim might be good private partners to work with on this. OR if we have enough community members interested in this, then it can become a community effort
[2024-01-31, 12:18:05] ~ Soham: I also came around something called RASA. Thoughts that might be helpful
[2024-01-31, 12:19:17] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Now I have question. If people really don't have much of a use for indic models since most can now read English, why do we focus on the indic aspect other than just for preserving these languages?
[2024-01-31, 12:19:19] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yeah precisely
[2024-01-31, 12:20:21] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: think about STT and TTS atleast also instead of written communication, there are a lot of folks who do not even write.
[2024-01-31, 12:20:53] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: these indic models can also help in cross lingual knowledge transfer .. what are the chinese doing then :) ? they are doing in chinese models right ?
[2024-01-31, 12:21:09] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: That's what I said, because we are moving slowly, when we are ready to rescue, they will be museum pieces, preserved to be in model weights. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-01-31, 12:21:28] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: so i dont think it is just language preservations etc. it is much broader than this to me.
[2024-01-31, 12:22:58] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: because we still speak in those languages?
[2024-01-31, 12:23:47] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yeah this number is still huge and will keep growing in a large country like India.

point some good resources
[2024-01-31, 16:22:19] Ravi Theja: @917025755203/ @919446220252 can comment on RAGAS part.

You can check llamaindex evaluation modules as well - https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/module_guides/evaluating/root.html

If you are looking to evaluate embeddings and rerankers - worth checking this article - https://blog.llamaindex.ai/boosting-rag-picking-the-best-embedding-reranker-models-42d079022e83
[2024-01-31, 17:00:29] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I found this article interesting - one of the realities of LLMs is that the prompt based interface imposes some constraints on which groups/sub-groups of users can use them effectively. https://www.uxtigers.com/post/ai-articulation-barrier

[2024-01-31, 23:23:48] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: I have one question about rerankers. If i am already using a embedding and vector search,  are rerankers still helpful.  If yes then how do they help - as while doing vector search we are already comparing the distance of the query embedding with the items in our vector db. What does rerankers do differently then embedding models
[2024-01-31, 23:24:52] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: I am using cohere embedding and I tried to add cohere reranking and it didn't give any benefit to me . In most cases it returned to me the exact top n documents that I had submitted with minor differences
[2024-01-31, 23:25:06] Nirant K: Cross Encoders learn the relationship between query and each sentence, one at a time — that's why they're slower. The distance function is "learnt" per se.
[2024-01-31, 23:25:29] Nirant K: Embedding model the distance function is whatever model maker said to use e.g. cosine, dot
[2024-01-31, 23:30:04] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: Just to reiterate in laymen terms what you are saying is that embedding models works on individual queries and represent each word in some multi dimensional space and then when we seach them using faiss or hnsw we are using a distance function defined by model maker to find documents with the best similariy score.  However in case of rerankers, the model itself learn how to relate 2 documents to each other
[2024-01-31, 23:31:44] Nirant K: modern embedding models don't work on "word" level, the rest looks right
[2024-01-31, 23:32:11] Nirant K: This might be helpful? https://osanseviero.github.io/hackerllama/blog/posts/sentence_embeddings2/
[2024-02-01, 00:01:41] Rohit Aggarwal: Yes, have seen heavy usage across Anyscale models. They’re a great server less endpoint hosting platform. Provides an easy way to move into dedicated instances as scale increases. 

Over the last few weeks have seen some challenges with them in terms of complaints that mistral doesn’t perform as well and speeds have gone down. 

They’re fixing this across customers, but it still is a really good choice when trying out models. 

Other players are together and fireworks which have a wider model support. 

Xylem and Monster are 2 companies in India that also provide these setverless and dedicated endpoints that are reliable
[2024-02-01, 00:09:46] Nirant K: Anecdotally, Anyscale and Together are more widely used than Claude or Gemini in hacker circles.

I was chatting with my barber who bought PayTM because he was tipped by his advisor to hit 800 soon. He got in at 570 and was at 670 when we talked. I told him this tipping stuff is scam and he should get out asap. I asked him if he use PayTM. He said he uses GPay. Neither me. He got the drift of why he should exit. Will continue the discussion with him in my next hair cut.

Moral: The stock was made to rise in last 2 months by such tipping network of agents and small time investors(innocent folks). Only smart investors/ insiders cashed out early and rest paid for a lesson in investment💀

[2024-02-01, 15:20:03] Ojasvi Yadav: If you can share a CSV of this with me, I can find all the duplicates or similar products in an hour
[2024-02-01, 15:20:46] Ojasvi Yadav: If you're looking for the approach, then I can lay down the flow here
[2024-02-01, 15:20:46] ~ Ganaraj: Would love to know how 😅, as this is my companies info and I cant share the csv

[2024-02-01, 15:57:22] Ojasvi Yadav: What Dhruv shared is a repo that seems to do what you need
[2024-02-01, 15:58:24] Ojasvi Yadav: Essentially you need to vectorize your product name column, and compute a distance metric over the vectors. For a given product, the products with lowest distance metric will do the job.

Just spotted this
[2024-02-01, 16:41:32] Dhruv Anand: No need for vectors right away. First try basic fuzzy matching techniques that the library implements. If that's not enough, you can do clustering of vector embeddings. In the end, it's a matter of choosing between precision and recall
[2024-02-01, 17:15:34] ~ Ganaraj: Is there a way to get embeddings for each product and then "add them" for a particular user ( based on view, click, add etc ) and then generate a representational "user embedding" - basically putting the user on the same vector space as the product vectors based on their interactions ? This could be a good idea to do recommendations I guess ?
[2024-02-01, 17:16:02] ~ Ganaraj: Has anyone done prior work on something similiar to this ?
[2024-02-01, 17:17:02] Dhruv Anand: Yes, this is a common approach in large scale recommendation systems. Quite different from the deduplication problem you asked initially
[2024-02-01, 17:20:52] ~ Ganaraj: @917977314565 agree. Is there any documentation on this ? Do you have any references for it ? I havent been able to find anything so far, which does exactly what I am talking about.

[2024-02-01, 20:37:20] Akash Tandon: Since you've already discussed the nitty gritties above, sharing experience as someone who tried a similar setup. 

For our use case, reranking did make a difference compared to pure vector search. 
Eg. based on multiple human evaluations, there were instances where relevant documents jumped tens of places (significant for us) after reranking.

On a related note, using a hybrid search approach followed by reranking lead to better results than just vector search.

[2024-02-02, 00:37:31] Pratyush Choudhury: Not sure if I got your question correctly but I was thinking of something along these lines (not sure if they’re similar/different): 
* is this a good way of ranking vs say asking the number to do a ranking b/w 1-10? LLMs are naturally not very good w/ arithmetic 
* ⁠Does this depend (and change) on what data the model is trained on?
[2024-02-02, 00:49:08] Shibangi Barua Budweiser Teetotaler: Yes to the first bullet ofcourse but was thinking - will this suffice for different usecases? 

Largely this is - multi class classification but what is considered a good prompt for some usecase may or may not be good for some? ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-02-03, 22:21:59] ~ Karan Danthi: Hi all - a question. Our work suggests that Taiwan will be shipping 150bn usd of gpus by the end of this year. It’s very likely that there will be an oversupply. If this is true and the cost of compute falls materially, what does that mean for the growth of ai workloads ? I presume the elasticity would be quite high and software would start being shipped and adopted a lot faster ?
[2024-02-03, 23:02:48] ~ Ganaraj: How do u assess that the GPUs will end up being oversupply ?

[2024-02-03, 23:16:41] ~ Prateek: do they send the user inputs to the cloud somewhere or on the device itself? which, given the device specifications, I don't think so
[2024-02-03, 23:17:12] Gokul Krishnan: Workloads - more ablations on larger models. I don't agree with the faster shipping cycles because models just take longer train and additional model / data parallelism wouldn't help IMO
[2024-02-03, 23:19:49] ~ Pathik Ghugare: most probably they are using gpt4-vision APIs

But haven't had results worth sharing yet.

[2024-02-04, 12:27:26] Hemant Mohapatra: Yeah, saw this. I worry much of this doesn't feel very peer reviewed. Is this the new "transformer" or just a niche approach that won't scale with larger context windows?
[2024-02-04, 12:31:30] Sparsh Chutiya Agarwal Nova GenZ: only time will tell as the model size also is very small, but their twitter post mentioned that they are currently seeing patterns of scaling like a transformer by token count & as such training a larger model

[2024-02-04, 12:46:45] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: yeah those web sources that use translated machine related stuff obviously will feed same semantic mistakes into the LLMs. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-04, 12:51:17] Sumba: question, with most if not all of these linear approach architectures without using attention

[2024-02-04, 15:26:50] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: Used to get very excited about all the research into models making attention more efficient - Linformer, Nystromformer etc. Learnt that they aren’t really worth looking into if you’re on the application side unless they stand the test of time. RWKV has been around for a while, but like those other models in my opinion the jury is still out.
[2024-02-04, 17:37:40] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Grouped query Attention in llama2 paper is one such optimization for speed that comes into mind.

I am looking for a prompt testing and evaluation tool that can compare different versions of prompts side by side, automate the chat execution from the test dataset, and provide options for human annotation and feedback. 
I found a few tools that have these functionalities but they didn't have multimodal support.
Is there any tool that supports all of these functionalities?

[2024-02-05, 17:35:47] Priyesh OnFinance: If yes, I know the script for this but not a tool. Its very easy to do this using a cross encoder model thats fine tuned to rank duplicate content. Should be multiple on HF

I want to improve the testing efficiency.

Whenever the prompt is updated, it needs to execute the user messages including the assistant replies from the new prompt or model.
Then the human evaluators can collaborate and evaluate the new prompt.

[2024-02-05, 19:09:03] ~ Jeff from Gearsk: Guys, 
I have an interesting question. 

What is the best way to build a customer profile that is not limited to a list of static attributes. Say, I want to provide the customer profile in runtime for LLM to use for recommending something. 

Should one think of maintaining an embedding for each customer? If yes, what are the best known techs to use? This would be quite sparse. Or let me know other options. 

Thanks in advance.
[2024-02-05, 19:12:30] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: If sparse embeddings is the ask, then this will help:

@917737887058 is the subject matter expert here.
[2024-02-05, 19:19:30] ~ Jeff from Gearsk: Thanks. The basic question is, is embedding a viable approach to store or build customer profile. 
Say, there are more than a million customers. 
Each customer will interact with the system using text. The text and results are what will contribute to the profile building.
[2024-02-05, 19:21:48] ~ Jeff from Gearsk: I am open to also have a system where common likes and dislikes between users are factored some way in the embedding database.
Finally, the use case is to have some way use the embedding for providing customer preferences when finding something using LLM.

[2024-02-05, 20:54:11] ~ Mahesh Sathiamoorthy: Yes, embeddings are a pretty good start. 
Depending on how your data is organized, a constrastive learning based approach to finetune your embeddings will help.
Then you can use these embeddings as input to the LLM (will need to finetune it though — this can get tricky). You can DM me and we can discuss more on this.
[2024-02-05, 21:02:31] Sparsh Chutiya Agarwal Nova GenZ: Has anyone here tried LLMs from perplexity labs?

[2024-02-05, 21:07:02] Sparsh Chutiya Agarwal Nova GenZ: they are running it on top of cheaper open source models, Mixtral now only costs $0.07 per million input tokens so they can actually afford to keep it free

[2024-02-05, 21:51:46] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Is it absolutely necessary to use LLM for recommendations using a customer profile ?
[2024-02-05, 21:51:57] Nirant K: Yes, you're converging to a recommendation system. You can implement RecSys — with both dense e.g. text which customer has said and sparse e.g. similarity between what different customers have said. You can see a very rough outline of how one would implement this: https://github.com/qdrant/examples/blob/master/sparse-vectors-movies-reco/recommend-movies.ipynb
[2024-02-05, 21:54:13] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: @917737887058 then if it’s just creating and manipulating embeddings or operating on embeddings..LLMs will not be needed at all right ? It’s not the correct type of tool needed
[2024-02-05, 21:55:20] ~ Jeff from Gearsk: Sure. Would love to discuss more how the fine tuning goes for the embedding.
[2024-02-05, 21:56:39] ~ Jeff from Gearsk: Yes. To take advantage of LLM and the ontology it can provide. 
There is an interesting video on this.

[2024-02-05, 21:57:37] Nirant K: LLMs are too OP to say you can't do X with them. They're just slow/expensive for some use cases right now, but that's a point in time decision e.g. rescoring after candidate generation used to be separated from older ranking engines like Elastic — modern ones like Qdrant bake it into the system because underlying design constraints are different

The ascetic Vālmīki asked Nārada, the best of sages and foremost of those conversant with words, ever engaged in austerities and Vedic studies.

Just an idea: After the Sanskrit verse, perhaps romanized Sanskrit could be added / generated ? I see that ambuda can do that in kannada/English so that those who don't know how to read Sanskrit letters can learn how to pronounce and map each word
[2024-02-06, 08:52:59] Ravi Theja: Interesting. Which LLM did you use as an evaluator here? gpt-3.5-turbo did not work really great with the prompts they mentioned in the paper even for simpler context relevancy evaluation tasks.
[2024-02-06, 09:09:34] ~ Khauneesh: Yes it was gpt 3.5 didn’t have approval for gpt4 :) hence I tried for alternative techniques as well like for example we got all variants of answer “ I could not find answer provided in the context” and did similarity search of output with these possible negative outputs and then routed it to web api

[2024-02-06, 10:50:29] Pratik Bhavasar: Precursor question - why are there no scaling laws of encoder-decoder models?
[2024-02-06, 11:34:17] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: There's also a National Mission for Manuscripts. Dunno the status. https://www.namami.gov.in/our-programmes
[2024-02-06, 11:47:27] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: i came across this paper: https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.07740
they say “Our findings suggest that scaling behavior of encoder-decoder NMT models is predictable, but the exact formulation of scaling laws might vary depending on the particular architecture or task being studied.”
so i guess it is not as relatively simple as what is said in the chinchilla paper

as a result, since you cannot predict in advance the result of enc-dec models in terms of generation quality, it is not as much of a smart investment as training decoder only models?
[2024-02-06, 12:33:39] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I think Chinchilla was anyways 
- Decoder only models
- I think with instruction tuned, RLHF tuned models, this needs to be revised

Already tried their chat (no one responds) and developer groups.
[2024-02-06, 12:42:36] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I think when it comes to instruction tuned data, I don't think the optimum rows of per parameters ratio holds here. You had Orca basically using a lot of it.
Then you had textbooks are all you need saying only1000 rows for a significantly smaller model.  So I think there might be an optimum ratio but its different for this type of mode

[2024-02-06, 13:39:31] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: For RAG on csvs, you have to do certain operations that require operations on whole csv, like taking mean of certain columns etc.
So my doubt is how do you store the csvs? Do you upload it to S3 and then retrieve it at the time of operations when the query has been formed

Example. I have a data of user complaints which are categorized in 1 column
One query comes which is take a count of data which is category X which is mentioned in category column, So obviously I use LLM to generate a pandas query but then I need to operate on the csv, for that I want to run it via pandas. 
So I need to load whole csv, so in this case, how do you store csvs. Is storing in S3 and fetching dynamically the way or is there a better way?
[2024-02-06, 13:43:58] Sumba: Yea i faced the same issue too

The GenAI part is generating query, that part is clear, but what's an efficient way of loading the particular csv, or is doing sqlite3 on a different server a more appropriate solution

[2024-02-06, 15:24:17] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: @919420377689 has created an interesting model to experiment with "The Overton window" called Mockingbirdv1-SFT, a bold Large Language Model with strong opinions. If you're looking for clear, decisive statements instead of just lots of facts, this model is perfect for you. 

The goal is to broaden the range of acceptable discussion (expand the Overton window) and help change the way people think. The model's answers might upset pretty much everyone at some point, but they'll also bring new views to the table. Some ideas may seem silly at first glance, but giving them a closer look could be enlightening—or, indeed, they might just be silly. In that case, just resample for another perspective.

This model stands out because it's been fine-tuned using LoRA on Mistral with a synthetic dataset that includes 4,000 diverse and nuanced opinions. We've carefully curated a dataset of about 1,000 questions and generated approximately 4 responses for each, exploring different perspectives on these questions. This innovative approach ensures that Mockingbirdv1-SFT offers a wide array of thought-provoking and varied insights.

Example Response Sampled from Mockingbirdv1-SFT:
Is accelerating the techno-capital machine best bet for humanity's survival?

Absolutely, accelerating the techno-capital machine is the only way to ensure humanity's survival! We must fully embrace technology and unleash its full potential to overcome the numerous challenges we face. Without a doubt, this is the key to a better future for all of humanity....

[2024-02-06, 16:12:26] Ojasvi Yadav: Not sure if anyone's working on this but "mixture of adapters"

Instead of having 8 different model weights, we deal with 8 different adaptors fine-tuned on different tasks using the the same base model

Benefits 
- low vram consumption, you could even do a mixture of 16 or 32 adaptors
- ⁠finetunability - every domain can be broken down into subdomains, a "mixture of adaptors" combined with a capable model router could be applied on various tasks
- ⁠mixtral only activates 2 (correct me if this number is wrong) models at a time due to vram concerns. But a mixture of adaptors can have all its adaptors used and ensembles together to sample the most coherent output

[2024-02-06, 21:42:04] ~ Sachin Kalsi: as an intermediate, of course we can ask GPT to get small cities/tier-2 cities list & filter out. But those returned cities might not be there in our database !

any other ways to handle ?
[2024-02-06, 21:45:21] Priyesh OnFinance: agreed hence use JSON filters to approximately get a dataframe from the DB
[2024-02-06, 21:45:27] Priyesh OnFinance: get it into markdown and go wham
[2024-02-06, 21:46:08] Priyesh OnFinance: somehow LLMs love markdown
[2024-02-06, 21:46:13] Priyesh OnFinance: idk why tbh
[2024-02-06, 21:50:32] ~ Anantharam: I did not understand how this solves the problem.
[2024-02-06, 21:50:56] Priyesh OnFinance: basically you should use whatever you can for table or subtable selection
[2024-02-06, 21:51:36] Priyesh OnFinance: and make that as reliable as possible
[2024-02-06, 21:52:16] ~ Anantharam: What does that have to do with markdowns?
[2024-02-06, 21:52:38] Priyesh OnFinance: no no as in converting data into a markdown table really helps LLMs
[2024-02-06, 21:52:56] ~ Anantharam: Ohh. Got it.
[2024-02-06, 21:53:15] Priyesh OnFinance: keep the structure in their “head” ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-06, 21:54:49] Priyesh OnFinance: vs a JSON or smthg ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-06, 21:54:59] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Presumably the training data has enough examples of markdown formatted code that it is a naturally emergent behaviour.
[2024-02-06, 21:55:44] Priyesh OnFinance: yes that is my assumption but sadly my visualization of 8192 dimensions is bad, so cant comment 😂

[2024-02-07, 00:39:30] Abhishek Mishra: This is more of a hallucinations minimisation problem than dealing with structured data
[2024-02-07, 00:41:11] Abhishek Mishra: the structured data handling is best handled with a SQL/sql-like solution, the hallucinations minimisation thing is something where you'll have to try out multiple methods and see what works best
[2024-02-07, 00:50:44] ~ Pathik Ghugare: Images generated using ChatGPT+ and API now includes metadata to identify if it was AI generated or not

I get it they want others to identify whether image is AI generated or not but it can be easily manipulated since it's just a part of the metadata😅

[2024-02-07, 08:22:10] ~ Atishay: It can be easily manipulated but 90% of people won’t bother.

The future imo is

1) Any image which is real has some watermarking done. (this doesn’t answer the qn of how to prevent people from artificially adding this).
2) Any image which is ai gen also has something like that done.
3) Any image without either is completely disregarded

But, haven't put it on a production kind of system, just played around with small documents dataset.
Will keep evaluating this. Interested in community feedback on this too. ‎<This message was edited>

Something similar to what @919420377689 and me were discussing a bit earlier post paper session.

[2024-02-07, 11:10:29] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: @919550164716  and @916309525405 previously released datasets translated and romanized in Telugu.

Today they have released the experimental v0 version of the Llama2 model, fine-tuned on these datasets - 𝐓𝐞𝐥𝐮𝐠𝐮-𝐋𝐥𝐚𝐦𝐚-7𝐁-𝐯0-𝐈𝐧𝐬𝐭𝐫𝐮𝐜𝐭🎉.

This model shows the capability to understand both Romanized and Native Telugu.

In the example:

🔹 𝐑𝐨𝐦𝐚𝐧𝐢𝐳𝐞𝐝 𝐓𝐞𝐥𝐮𝐠𝐮: Given a query (instruction) in Romanized Telugu and an input in English, the model successfully answers the query.
🔹 𝐍𝐚𝐭𝐢𝐯𝐞 𝐓𝐞𝐥𝐮𝐠𝐮: With both the query (instruction), and the input in Native Telugu the model efficiently provides an answer.

The model demonstrates proficiency in the following tasks to a certain extent:

1️⃣ Processing Native Telugu instructions and input, and responding in Native Telugu.
2️⃣ Handling Roman Telugu instructions with English text, and responding in English.
3️⃣ Summarizing Roman Telugu instructions for Roman Telugu input.
4️⃣ Summarizing Native Telugu instructions for English input.

[2024-02-07, 11:10:32] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Keep it going on guys!
[2024-02-07, 11:19:08] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: Why is getting a ML job in this market so hard? 

I have been working on NLP since quite some time as an undergrad. I decided to come for MS to the US, and got into a nice university (UC San Diego), thinking I have a good skill set and can get some decent opportunities seeing what the previous MS batches had gotten. However to my surprise, the market stopped hiring nearly completely. And the situation has been the same since the past 1.5 years. Even if you get an interview, the bar is (imo) high for a new grad role.

What to do?
[2024-02-07, 11:20:06] Nirant K: Little off topic for this group, but happy to talk more on the Watercooler one — there are folks hiring for these roles in US as well, happy to tag them there.
[2024-02-07, 11:21:09] Nirant K: The hiring bar is a function of market and decided mostly by Jeremy Powell, and less by companies and talent supply in the last decade or so. This is true for US and Indian talent markets fwiw. 
[2024-02-07, 11:21:23] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: Okay, sharing it there! Thanks for bearing with me
[2024-02-07, 11:21:47] Nirant K: Watercooler for reference: https://chat.whatsapp.com/H9QMoo9nNXF9ckJ7jEJ98J
[2024-02-07, 11:22:06] Paras Chopra Wingify: Also isn’t ML eating itself? The marginal returns to perfecting models might not be there
[2024-02-07, 11:23:32] Nirant K: I mean, ML has been eating _atleast_ itself since Optuna/Hyperopt days. So a case has to be made that there's no such career as ML, you can be a dev who knows ML or an academic who does intelligence. There is no middle ground which you can build a 10 year career "stint" on.
[2024-02-07, 11:27:35] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: I should have rather phrased it as an MLE job..
[2024-02-07, 11:28:29] Nirant K: MLE is right in the middle, not niche enough to be beginner/new grad friendly
[2024-02-07, 11:30:37] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: Ohh damn, did not think of it that way
What is something that you think is niche?
[2024-02-07, 11:42:36] Nirant K: Personal example of trying to find a niche: Of every $100 I've made in last 12 months, about $80 has come from performance e.g. latency and cost work — not your classical MLE work of working with models and deploying them. This is specifically in the context of search e.g. text ranking within NLP too.

Ideally, I'd like to have an even narrower focus e.g. ranking for multi-modal RAG
[2024-02-07, 11:43:32] Nirant K: From a new grad lens, niches are slightly less well defined: My new grad niche was natural images OCR e.g. driving signs, painted house numbers and had spent time on that in undergrad. 
[2024-02-07, 11:54:35] Kashyap Kompella: LLMs have changed the opportunities & landscape for NLP research. There’s been a lot of angst / reflection in the NLP community (particularly those currently doing PhDs on what research topics to pursue)… here is an interesting paper that tries to answer that question — “Many NLP researchers are experiencing an existential crisis triggered by the astonishing success of ChatGPT and other systems based on large language models (LLMs). After such a disruptive change to our understanding of the field, what is left to do?” https://arxiv.org/pdf/2311.05020.pdf
[2024-02-07, 11:55:12] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: Thank you so much for sharing
Suppose I decide that my niche is X (for me at the moment it is RAG - I will try and narrow that down), how can I market that efficiently to recruiters/hiring managers? Make my profile seen from thousands of applications?
Also, will being specified to a niche reduce the opportunities I can apply and get accepted to?
[2024-02-07, 11:56:55] Aditya Mandke GenAI WhatsApp Group: (I am now fearing being judged by asking these trivial questions in front of hundreds of Legends in this group. Please forgive this student for being naive🥹) ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-02-07, 11:59:40] Priyank Agrawal: Tell me a successful person who is not shameless.
[2024-02-07, 11:59:50] Vetrivel PS: Yes when you Niche down your no of opportunities will go down but the value you create for your specific client will be high and Nicheing down to a narrow level pays you more than others working on general things.
[2024-02-07, 11:59:53] Prakash Sankar Harbor: man it's not about tech. 99% of people don't think about how to make their stakeholders' lives easier.
[2024-02-07, 12:00:12] Prakash Sankar Harbor: if you literally thought about how to reduce work for the person you are working for, you would be ahead of basically everybody
[2024-02-07, 12:01:19] Prakash Sankar Harbor: most people tend to want leaders to give them the tools to succeed and position them for success. The people on my team I really remember, I can throw a task to and I know they'll think about it, and better - they'll come back to me with a well written piece of communication telling me exactly what they did, so I know at all times why / what / how long it took/will take
[2024-02-07, 12:02:44] Prakash Sankar Harbor: if you want a job, the person who is hiring you is trying to offload work. That isn't just "finish this programming task". It's really "I need to do X".
[2024-02-07, 12:02:52] Nirant K: How to market: Write and show your work
[2024-02-07, 12:02:53] Prakash Sankar Harbor: if you are somebody who can prove that you will do X (completely, entirely, without instruction)
[2024-02-07, 12:02:55] Prakash Sankar Harbor: you are hireable
[2024-02-07, 12:03:04] Prakash Sankar Harbor: if you are somebody who finishes a task and asks what next?
[2024-02-07, 12:03:13] Prakash Sankar Harbor: you're going to get treated as a fresher and frankly as work for the person hiring you to manage
[2024-02-07, 12:03:18] Prakash Sankar Harbor: and who wants to do more work after spending money hiring someone?
[2024-02-07, 12:03:21] Nirant K: +1, with the caveat that new grads often don't have enough context to reduce work or manage up well
[2024-02-07, 12:03:25] Prakash Sankar Harbor: the whole point is to do less work
[2024-02-07, 12:03:34] Prakash Sankar Harbor: not the hiring person's problem right? sorry to be brutal about it
[2024-02-07, 12:03:53] Prakash Sankar Harbor: but like the job market is tough, there's lots of competition, and you are competing with everybody.
[2024-02-07, 12:04:29] Prakash Sankar Harbor: if a company is hiring freshers exclusively, they're likely hiring you because you are cheap and they believe you are an undervalued asset
[2024-02-07, 12:04:48] Prakash Sankar Harbor: so it's in your self interest to prove that you are an overvalued asset to the market in general
[2024-02-07, 12:05:09] Prakash Sankar Harbor: *not overvalued asset, that your value is much higher than your pay currently
[2024-02-07, 12:05:25] Prakash Sankar Harbor: thanks for listening to my Ted talk
[2024-02-07, 12:06:46] Nirant K: not brutal, but want to recommend game plays which the specific player can execute, not the playbook which say, you can execute
[2024-02-07, 12:07:14] Prakash Sankar Harbor: just think about the work the person who is hiring you is doing, what they complain about and just do it
[2024-02-07, 12:07:16] Nirant K: on point
[2024-02-07, 12:07:29] Prakash Sankar Harbor: like my team, every week, without fail, fucks up updating github issues. What is my ask? I don't give a shit about github issues.
[2024-02-07, 12:07:43] Nirant K: bulk of new grad hiring about finding underpriced talent, bulk of 5-15y hiring is about hiring for speed, bulk of senior hiring is about hiring for trust and integrity
[2024-02-07, 12:07:43] Prakash Sankar Harbor: I care that I know what you are doing, and why, so I can intervene in case you are working on the wrong thing
[2024-02-07, 12:08:16] Prakash Sankar Harbor: a team of very good engineers BTW! it just goes to show that engineering is not my pain point right now.
[2024-02-07, 12:10:05] Nirant K: Helpful book on how to write and market yourself as a dev: https://learninpublic.org/

If you're still a student, and would like can sponsor a copy or ask the author to sponsor directly as well
[2024-02-07, 12:13:17] Prakash Sankar Harbor: I mean final piece of advice before I get back to it lol - if you can get your hiring manager to agree on specific metrics you have to move, and then move them, that's going to be really remembered
[2024-02-07, 12:13:20] Prakash Sankar Harbor: everything else forgotten
[2024-02-07, 12:13:38] Prakash Sankar Harbor: most hiring managers are incompetent - so they won't even think about it
[2024-02-07, 12:13:55] Prakash Sankar Harbor: they'll just have a very nebulous way of judging you until it's appraisal season and then they'll use some dumb fuck rubrik
[2024-02-07, 12:14:41] Prakash Sankar Harbor: "does everybody else like the way this person smells on a tuesday evening?"
[2024-02-07, 12:14:43] Prakash Sankar Harbor: for ex
[2024-02-07, 12:15:51] Raghav Tensoic GenAI WhatsApp Group: wow

[2024-02-07, 18:05:11] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: India needs more of these heroes. We have unfortunately let go of many people because of this particular issue. It's a rampant problem.
[2024-02-07, 18:05:40] Nirant K: For wider audience, hit rate of 1 doesn't imply accuracy of 1. In fact, there isn't an accuracy as such in the ranking sense.
[2024-02-07, 18:08:51] Srinivas Rao Jami: Is this on English Text or multilingual?
[2024-02-07, 18:19:00] Ojasvi Yadav: I guess @918056043866 meant to ask about the window size of quantifying a hit
[2024-02-07, 18:20:54] Ojasvi Yadav: Average reciprocal hit rate (ARHR) gives more weightage to hits at the upper echelon, instead of the vanilla hitrate which gives equal weightage to all hits

With ARHR, window size of hits becomes irrelevant and we can straight up have an apple to Apple comparison
[2024-02-07, 18:21:40] Ojasvi Yadav: Would be nice to see retrieval/ranking metrics use ARHR more
[2024-02-07, 18:24:00] Kartik Mandaville: English

[2024-02-08, 13:51:00] ~ Saniya Jaswani: You should expand your horrizon. Commonly people are looking for- Gen AI, LLM, NLP , MLops, Recommendation systems.

[2024-02-08, 15:51:48] Priyesh OnFinance: yes this is kind of what @918778729707 and I were discussing on linkedin
[2024-02-08, 15:51:55] Priyesh OnFinance: is should code/actions be a separate modality?

[2024-02-08, 15:57:33] Anubhav mishra Zupay: LAM will be a generalization for actions, something on the lines of ACT-1

[2024-02-08, 16:00:49] Anubhav mishra Zupay: These guys are in the lead, they've been doing it for quite sometime. One may argue what's the purpose of building foundation models for Actions, seems like the use case they've shown is useful.
[2024-02-08, 16:00:57] ~ Mayank Gupta: I'll be disappointed if it's LAM based. I'd rather they build Actions like function calling by expanding Custom GPTs
[2024-02-08, 16:02:49] Priyesh OnFinance: lots of opinons on this but basically still thinking on this

[2024-02-08, 16:17:04] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Maybe it might not be transformer based. Can just be a generalization of function calling. No info on that
[2024-02-08, 16:18:18] Nirant K: Visual element is too important to limit themselves to function calling
[2024-02-08, 16:18:43] Priyesh OnFinance: 100% function calling is one of the happy emergent properties of scaling LLMs
[2024-02-08, 16:18:50] Priyesh OnFinance: imo atleast

[2024-02-08, 16:51:53] Lucifer 😎: Hugging face uses KV cache by default right for decoder based models ?
[2024-02-08, 17:01:40] Lucifer 😎: also, how does one decide the parameter *G* in GQA

I know that G will be always >1 and <= Num of heads. H
[2024-02-08, 17:11:40] ~ Mayank Gupta: Visual element of what? Visual element is only important if you pre-suppose your apps exist before your OS.
If you control the marketplace of applications and define the rules, the visual element aligns to your needs.
For instance Android/iOS didn't care that most websites were filled with hyperlinks
[2024-02-08, 17:14:56] ~ Mayank Gupta: Your Adept, Rabbit etc don't have any leverage, so have to use existing apps and thus comply with the existing visual elements. Open AI has massive leverage and can create the rules around interactions as per its need - so they can define how a form is filled in their new era OS (through NL prompt / function calling) and not try to visually decode this form.
[2024-02-08, 17:26:48] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Do you mean work on creating agents that can plan and reason with LAMs the UI is chatGPT. So there's only backends that needs to be done ?
[2024-02-08, 17:32:59] ~ Mayank Gupta: Partially. But I mean if you (say as Uber) will have to redesign your app (say into an Uber CustomGPT) so that a 'software that controls devices' will be able to call all possible functions, then there isn't a need for a visual model that can traverse the app to understand it.
'Book me a cab' is enough to trigger a cab booking and won't need to figure where to click to execute it.
Hence was trying to wonder why we will need visual models in a stable state, agree they might help to kick off the field?
[2024-02-08, 17:34:23] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Creating datasets for training Action models that's where you'll need that I think 😂

[2024-02-08, 20:19:34] Nihit (Yuuki): We are trying to find out the top-k children of the parents from the RAG. 

The way we are doing this is by brute force, 
Suppose we find x number of children and then filter by parent. If we don't have k-children, we find 2x or so children. We then keep increasing the number of children until we find the correct number of top-k children of a parent. 
Given that the vector database would pick the child first and then filter by parent, but here, as we want to pick the top children of a parent, this is getting a bit complicated. 

Has anyone tried doing something similar?

[2024-02-09, 23:27:43] ~ Ajay: Hey guys - how have you approached generating insights from structured data? Say you have 10k row table with mostly numerical data and you want to generate insights based on the question asked by the user ( simple eg: Does increasing column X result in better Y )?
[2024-02-09, 23:44:44] ~ Ganaraj: Isnt this text2sql ?

[2024-02-10, 00:10:31] ~ Ajay: I mean text2sql can only generate the SQL query. But knowing how to generate it is one thing but from the response, coming up with insights is another. The output of a SQL query is still structured data - how do you from that to insights ( which is also NL )
[2024-02-10, 00:13:00] ~ Ganaraj: I think this is where you have to go for multi-hop / chaining .. You first take the text, convert to sql, go do a sql query, bring back the data and then combine that with any questions you want to ask on the data.. send it all to a LLM again. Which should give you the answer ?

When the response to the SQL query is itself a table, how do you feed that efficiently to the LLM? How can you convert the table data to tokens for the context?

You can use text2sql to get CSV data, and then gpt can generate python code to load that data and generate insight, do pyplot, etc etc. If you have paid ChatGpt, you could quickly create test with ChatGpt only.
[2024-02-10, 02:18:03] Vamshi: This is grouped differently from the main community groups in WhatsApp right? 

Just pointing it out to those with a confusion similar to mine.

[2024-02-10, 07:18:11] Nirant K: Yes, most TF-IDF with BoW systems has a dimensionality curse.
[2024-02-10, 07:19:00] Nirant K: Also, cosine and dot are _projections_ — not distances in the way in the old ML textbooks talk about distances. They usually mean Euclidean/Manhattan kind of difference logic.
[2024-02-10, 07:51:09] ~ Aravindh: Worked a bit on this long time ago...just immediately reducing dimensions is a bit of a trivial solution...defeats the purpose of why we wanted those dimensions and features in the first place...truly discriminative features are in fact, making the distance larger as they should...noisy/irrelevant dimensions are the problematic ones...discerning between the 2 is the tough art 😅

Generally angles are more immune to curse of dimensionality than simply distances...one of the reasons why cosine tends to be a better choice than Euclidean etc ....have to revisit literature to see if things like jaccard etc are even more powerful while being more/equally advantageous on other dimensions such as speed of calculation, interpretability, adoption etc - with minhash etc it sounds plausible , but yeah, have to revisit literature and do some small experiments on our usecase

[2024-02-10, 16:03:43] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: All the things you mentioned such as sliding window attn and caching improve performance in terms of training and inferencing. The quality of the model always depends on the data that was used to pretrain
[2024-02-10, 16:05:50] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: If you'd see - performance in terms of quality:

Falcon 180B ~ Llama 70B

[2024-02-12, 08:59:01] ~ Naresh: I'm currently focusing on developing a chatbot that will integrate with our services running on Kubernetes clusters. The aim is to build a chatbot capable of engaging in conversation with users and confirming a few questions

1. Could you recommend the simplest model, preferably with less than 7 billion parameters, that is currently being used for chatbot conversations?
    2. In my scenario, the chatbot needs to proactively reach out to users, ask them specific questions, and collect their responses. 
3. For those of you utilizing open-source models for your chatbots, which cloud infrastructure services are you using for hosting? I'm exploring options and would appreciate your insights. 
4. Additionally, if there's a need for fine-tuning the model, what infrastructure or platforms are you guys leveraging?

[2024-02-12, 09:05:29] Nirant K: 1 — Nothing less than 30B is typically useful for "conversations". Most people expect GPT3.5-like performance at the very least, and 7B models don't compare
2 — If there is a form filling/question asking nature of the conversation, I'd recommend looking at slot filling based approaches instead of LLM-led conversations
3 — I'd recommend against self-hosting large models unless you've prior exposure running small models, or at the very least xgboost in production as an org
4 — Fine-tuning usually becomes a function of GPU costs more than infra/platform considerations, so use whatever is cheapest to you — for many enterprises, this is Heztner
[2024-02-12, 09:27:48] Nirant K: I'm old enough to remember when papers used to have 1-4 authors. Now most papers have more authors than a cricket team

[2024-02-12, 09:37:49] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yup seems normal now. 

Even the open ai papers have 12 plus folks in most of their research. 😆

That said I always look for novel ideas in any paper, reproducible code and novel algorithms, insights and new datasets curated well.
[2024-02-12, 09:38:26] Nirant K: WordNet from 1995 has one author: https://dl.acm.org/doi/10.1145/219717.219748 🤯

[2024-02-12, 09:40:14] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I don't like academia for the same reason. Why do you need to publish a paper for this? Just open the dataset. Teknium could have published 5 by now.
[2024-02-12, 09:41:42] Nirant K: No, that's fine. Society needs to pay you in cash, glory or power. Teknium gets paid in cash and glory. Academics get paid in glory and power.

[2024-02-12, 09:47:12] ~ YP: Perhaps it's people wanting to be featured even for shortest contribution and more concerned about getting their name in

[2024-02-12, 11:04:56] Ojasvi Yadav: Quick question - is anyone aware of rate limits on OpenAI fine-tune?
[2024-02-12, 11:05:01] Ojasvi Yadav: RPM?
[2024-02-12, 11:09:09] Ojasvi Yadav: Found the answer
> A fine-tuned model pulls from the same shared rate limit as the model it is based off of. For example, if you use half your TPM rate limit in a given time period with the standard gpt-3.5-turbo model, any model(s) you fine-tuned from gpt-3.5-turbo would only have the remaining half of the TPM rate limit accessible since the capacity is shared across all models of the same type. Put another way, having fine-tuned models does not give you more capacity to use our models from a total throughput perspective.
[2024-02-12, 11:52:36] ~ Karan Danthi: What is the power cost per inference query ? Is it still quite expensive ? How much cheaper does it need to become for inferencing to take off ?

When it became 8 hours hitting the same ball again and again and again, he dropped off. 95% of kids who pick up competitive sports drop by the age of 16 as its no more fun and every incremental improvement is exponential more work.
[2024-02-12, 16:30:26] Divya Tak: Very much true. Confusing learning with mastery is fallacious reasoning and moreover, for a lot of folks, there is a lot of intrinsic motivation to learn. Which is fun.
[2024-02-12, 16:35:11] Paras Chopra Wingify: Well said

Mastery is also a continuum.
[2024-02-12, 16:36:34] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Learning for fun, you will get bored someday. Learning for love, you will never, only way to master something. If not fun or love, just send them to our education system and coaching classes.
[2024-02-12, 16:36:57] Divya Tak: But that's the thing right? improvement isn't the only motivation, usually humans need mastery, agency and connectedness all present for long term engagement. Sadly when we systematise things we take away agency from the mix, and slowly connectedness also disappears. As long as a person chooses what they are doing, long term doing is also fun

[2024-02-12, 18:48:37] ~ Pathik Ghugare: I've been using OpenAI gpt4-V and it's just too slowwwww
Tried the Azure Deployment as well but there I am facing issues with the content filters which can't be removed in case of vision models unlike gpt3.5 versions
My use case was doing data extraction on insurance documents but those content filters keep flagging these documents as sensitive information 🥹
[2024-02-12, 18:58:16] ~ Chirag: You could try Llava as an OS alternative. Not sure how well it would perform for your use case as compared to gpt-4
[2024-02-12, 19:08:52] ~ Pathik Ghugare: In case of documents, 
LLAVAs Inbuilt "OCR" is really bad as compared to GPT4V and it also lacks the structural understanding (maybe due to the data on which it was trained)
[2024-02-12, 19:11:04] ~ Chirag: If you require only OCR without any intelligence, then there are even better alternatives
[2024-02-12, 19:47:05] ~ YP: LLaVa faces two major problems here:
1. It's not trained on enough documents. 
2. It is not patching enough tokens to take in the entire document. 

As of 2nd, if llava i relying on CLIP vit-l to provide visual features, which means at a time it will process a patch of 336 x 336 pixels. Which roughly means image can be broken down into patches and then processed to understand each part of the image rather than taking in just the essence of the image.
‎[2024-02-12, 19:47:36] ~ YP: ‎image omitted
[2024-02-12, 20:10:48] ~ Pathik Ghugare: Nah it's more of OCR + structural understanding --> structured output 
Basically I got multiple section and tables of insurance policy/claims so want to extract the same into a structured format 

I've tried combination of section/table detector + OCR  + gpt3.5 models and this works well when tables are simple but sometimes I get multiple header-cell pairs, in a single row which makes it difficult to capture in rowwise OCR

1. Try to answer questions — if you're tinkering, you either know how to get started on something adjacent or know someone who has done it
2. Explore other WhatsApp groups in the same WhatsApp Community: Women in AI, Startup Ecosystem, GPU, DeepMedia and Demos, GenAI x Security and so on — each has different intake criteria, so read before you send the join request please?
3. _Suspicion_ of spam will lead to removal from community. We also remove folks who've not participated in a conversation for more than 60 days.

There is a free weekly job and events board maintained by @919916576150 as well

[2024-02-13, 10:56:03] Prakash Sankar Harbor: damn this is cool
[2024-02-13, 10:56:15] Prakash Sankar Harbor: so basically *deploying* an LLM is trending towards not needing a super powerful GPU
[2024-02-13, 10:56:26] Prakash Sankar Harbor: there are just too many projects in the space geared towards this
[2024-02-13, 10:56:35] Jay Pokarna 2014 BPCC: “During inference, each layer is independent, relying only on the output of the previous layer.

Therefore, after running a layer, its memory can be released, keeping only the layer’s output. Based on this concept, AirLLM has implemented layered inference.”  This approach seems fairly obvious for running large models on hardware with low memory. Is anyone else following this approach? If not, then what is the reason for this?
[2024-02-13, 10:57:04] Prakash Sankar Harbor: so essentially, training might remain compute intensive, but deployment likely will not

[2024-02-13, 12:55:30] Gokul Krishnan: I/O bandwidth is the bottleneck. If, say, the main memory (RAM) can fit only half the layers, you have to load the entire model for each token generation from a slow flash drive. The LLMs in a flash paper is an improvement on the above but leverages other ideas like activation sparsity as well

> Lastly, we also fine-tuned GPT-4 in this setting. Being larger and more expensive, our goal was to assess if the model would benefit from additional knowledge in comparison to its base training. Due to its complexity and the amount of available data, we used Low Rank Adaptation (LoRA) (Hu et al., 2021) for the fine-tuning process..... In our study, optimization was done for 4 epochs, with a batch size of 256 samples, and a base learning rate of 1e-4 that decayed as training progressed. The fine-tuning was carried out on seven nodes, each with eight A100 GPUs, over a total runtime of 1.5 days.

Interestingly, they showed you need 7 nodes each with 8x A100 GPUs over 1.5 days and a bsz=256 and n_epochs=4.

And more interesting is technically, one can "approximate" how many params GPT4 has from this finetuning infra info

Might be interesting to you for agricultural references here @19377081307

Can someone throw some light on how to do approch doing post filtering after getting top k from ANN?

It's robust- will always work. And it can handle only 15 parallel request. More than that it will start erroring out after a certain time. 

I think you can always ask them to in increase the requests handling capacity at enterprise levels. But there's a limit. 
Beyond that you need to go for monthly subscription plan which is expensive but not like openai. 


It hosts multiple models, I think the cheapest was llama2

[2024-02-14, 09:40:35] ~ Ashish Singhal: I'm not sure about exact Claude versions, but I think they are 1.3, 2 and 2.1. 

1.3 ~ 2.1 >> 2. 

And GPT-4 is better than both 1.3 and 2.1. 

This is what I found with classification use case that I was working on.

But again, if you do best job with your prompt engineering, I think Claude 2.1 can beat GPT-4.

So yes, Claude 2.1 is a good alternative for GPT-4. It can achieve GPT-4 scores. It's just you have to efforts in prompt engineering.
[2024-02-14, 09:57:32] ~ Ajay: Got it. Curious has anyone seen Claude 2.1 preforming better than GPT-4 in practice? I understand in theory it could.
[2024-02-14, 10:05:56] Ambika Computational Mama: Update: it will verify your card so you start your training/spaces and then it’ll not work when the invoice hits. So I’m unable to pay for older trainings which could mean their death.

Any idea how to resolve this?
[2024-02-14, 16:09:20] ~ Ansha: Not sure

[2024-02-14, 16:14:59] ~ Ansha: I reached out to many colleges and schools, students were more focused on technical side of things 🥲 so unless there was something technical in return they wouldn't spend time doing this.
[2024-02-14, 16:16:16] ~ Ansha: And with Aya, only a handful of them got recognised in the research paper finally. And that was very evident from the beginning. Gone are the times when people would work for swags 😅

Maybe we should build some tools to make it easy for them?
[2024-02-14, 16:18:13] ~ Ansha: There would be no mention of their names anywhere. Only a handful of top region leads or language ambassadors got their names on the research paper
[2024-02-14, 16:20:58] ~ Ansha: Yup and dialects are many in Kannada. What you speak in Bangalore is different from Bijapur, which is again different in Udupi Manglore side or Coorg side.
[2024-02-14, 16:22:16] ~ Ganaraj: Probably true for all languages 🙂
[2024-02-14, 16:23:02] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: So if you're talking about stt tools this makes sense.

But writing uniform kannada there must be sizeable numbers. And this can be targeted.
[2024-02-14, 16:25:19] ~ Ansha: Should be that way ideally, but the problem is because people don't read/write alot of kannada thesedays, contributors tend to write what they speak.
[2024-02-14, 16:25:46] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Esp older generation and folks who can use online tools can be leveraged. Easy intuitive user interface to write like Aditya said must be enabled ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-02-14, 16:28:18] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: Hindi has many dialects as well no
[2024-02-14, 16:39:03] ~ Ansha: I can get you more insights from the Hindi ambassador of aya about that. 
As far as I understand 
- Written hindi is still constant up-to a good extent. 
- Another point that I see is for most of us in Karnataka, kannada is still a second language. There are many region specific languages as mother tongue, so tendency is to mix the two while talking , therefore writing 😵‍💫
[2024-02-14, 16:40:15] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Wait how was it mixed while writing? Isn't the script entirely different?😂
[2024-02-14, 16:40:28] Raghav Tensoic GenAI WhatsApp Group: oh but there are close to 60 million native speakers no
[2024-02-14, 16:48:41] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yes, so some info like how accurate it is in Hindi will be useful. I will recheck the paper for this. 

We now know it is not good in Telugu, Kannada. Waiting to see explorations, feedback from Tamil language folks on this.

[2024-02-14, 19:11:30] ~ Shobhan: Need help with efficient function calling:

We are working on a chatbot use case where there are around 80 functions the LLM(open api) can choose from. Passing all the functions won’t be efficient(cost and token-wise), how can we handle this in a better way?

Should I do a vector search for relevant functions and pass only those functions or any other suggestions?

This is a chatbot use case for an ecom where there are lot of options for users.
[2024-02-14, 19:30:04] ~ Ganaraj: Can you do some kind of domain specific pre-segmentation ? For example: First classify if the user query is about orders or user info etc.. This way you can get to domain specific functions ?
[2024-02-14, 19:53:42] Ruthvik Reddy: What are other companies, research papers, or open-source "Issue to Pull Request" initiatives similar to https://www.codegen.com/ (currently behind a waitlist)?

Context: While Copilot, CodeWhisperer and others focus on code autocompletion, Codegen sees to “codebase-wide” issues like large migrations, refactoring (i.e. restructuring an app’s code without altering its functionality) and adding new features that might involve multi file changes.

DhiWise is kind of similar (figma designs -> in repo code changes). Are there any other tools like these? Have you used any of them, and if so, what has been your experience with such tools?
[2024-02-14, 19:54:55] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Tried agents ?

[2024-02-14, 20:26:34] ~ Shobhan: Yes that's what we are doing right now but wanted to figure out if there is a better way to do it
[2024-02-14, 20:27:10] ~ Shobhan: Yes. This is the approach we are trying right now
[2024-02-14, 21:08:43] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: Any mapping of user options Vs functions ?
[2024-02-14, 21:23:13] ~ Kapil: What is learning pathways you have seen has worked best for newcomer to Gen AI - to be productive as individual contributor. Speaking to few universities - whose leadership has shown interest in building talent in Gen AI. No commercial involvement here - purely from perspective of talent building
[2024-02-14, 21:26:48] ~ Shobhan: Yes the mapping is available. But how do we pass the mapping and the descriptions also
[2024-02-14, 21:32:44] Rishabh Refuel.ai: Hi Shobhan - as a few other folks have mentioned, having an initial step to filter out most irrelevant functions is a good strategy. 

Vector search is often quite brittle for this, but we have seen smaller trained classifiers work exceptionally well here. The pros are that it’s a low-cost, low-latency call for a smaller (~100M param) model, which are quite easy to train. The cons are that you have to manage model lifecycle for a different model. 

Step can also be done by some application level context (who is the user, what are their functions of interest), or just using a large LLM as a classifier, but hard to get super high accuracy (which is likely quite important).
[2024-02-14, 21:48:47] ~ Divya Dixit: I also contributed some to Hindi annotations but could not keep up due to other commitments but it's nice to see them release it finally. At the time, they had a decent quality and number of annotations for hindi
[2024-02-14, 21:57:36] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: I would be interested if somebody found any research papers in this direction. So far I've only put together some rudimentary stuff to solve issues in personal projects. There are some demos but nothing that feels deep enough.
[2024-02-14, 22:16:15] ~ Shobhan: Got it, to summarise, these are the approaches to remove irrelevant functions: 
1. Domain-specific pre-segmentation (using customer, api etc)
2. Agents or llm to a specific category of query 
3. Small trained classifiers 
4. Vector search - may not be useful 

Would try these out and would conform which one worked best for us. 

Thanks everyone :)

Investigation of Google's gemini for medical domain by Chennai based SAAMA AI research.

 Our rigorous analysis uncovered that while Gemini exhibits a notable understanding across various medical subjects, it falls short when compared to leading models such as MedPaLM 2 and GPT-4 in certain areas, particularly in diagnostic accuracy and handling complex visual questions. 

A significant finding was Gemini’s high susceptibility to hallucinations, highlighting a critical area for improvement in terms of reliability and trustworthiness in generating medical information.
[2024-02-15, 11:33:13] Tanuj Bhojwani: Isn’t this the account that makes stuff up? He posted a lot of drama during the LK99 twitter moment.
[2024-02-15, 11:44:21] Dilip Ittyera CogniSwitch Founder: The last para is true for all current LLMs irrespective of domain
[2024-02-15, 11:56:13] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: Hey folks, any good reads on quantization of models?

Specifically, how does quantization work and benchmarks on hardware requirements on different methods

Thanks!
[2024-02-15, 12:17:54] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: @917880067859 is closely working with Startup Mahakumb and has reserved 10 seats for the group. Please reach out to him.

[2024-02-15, 12:36:42] ~ Mahesh Sathiamoorthy: Which LLM are you using? Have you considered finetuning?
[2024-02-15, 13:49:49] ~ Abhinand: Aya is bad at Tamil as well. I ran a quick test using Tamil Llama eval and it seems to be bad at every task except translation.
[2024-02-15, 14:19:00] Abhishek Mishra: With Aya, based on initial feedback, the dataset seems to be much more valuable than the LLM. Supporting lots of languages (101) probably isn't a great idea for mid/low resource languages for chat at this scale.
[2024-02-15, 14:19:57] Abhishek Mishra: RWKV also seems to be going primarily multilingual in their effort right now with the first 1T tokens of training.

[2024-02-15, 21:14:38] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: more specifics ideas will help the members to give more refined inputs.
[2024-02-15, 21:20:35] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: You get prefect recall till 512k.
[2024-02-15, 21:22:27] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Will the parameter numbers and context length converge? We had 500M model from Qwen recently.
[2024-02-15, 21:23:48] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Hehe. Will see. But it does seem that cost of higher context is going down day by day. Plus Gemini is pretty decent for Hindi RAG
[2024-02-15, 21:24:40] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Haven't tried. Will check it out. Thanks.
[2024-02-15, 21:27:09] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: Higher Context Length comes with higher pricing. Will be very costly in production
[2024-02-15, 21:33:02] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I anyways don't use more than 8k. All this ensures 8k recall should be perfect.
[2024-02-15, 21:33:27] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: A year ago you could not be sure 3k context length would give you prefect recall
[2024-02-15, 21:37:29] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Has anyone got access to Gemini 1.5

[2024-02-15, 22:15:56] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: It has a sparks of AGI feel. I’m not saying it’s AGI but this is the glimpse of what AI can do in work contexts. If it’s real
[2024-02-15, 22:16:02] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: Multi modality , vast in context learning abilities, can analyse entire code base at once
[2024-02-15, 22:17:03] Sumba: I'm sus on the context size claims still
[2024-02-15, 22:19:51] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: There’s no reason why it’s not possible

10M tokens with 99.2% recall. I want expecting this to happen so soon.
[2024-02-15, 22:51:36] Nilesh Transcend: *was not
[2024-02-15, 22:53:58] Nilesh Transcend: Still won't call it close to AGI.
[2024-02-15, 22:54:19] ~ Pathik Ghugare: Idts 
Even with GPT4s 128k token size, whenever I used to work with 8-10k tokens for tasks such as QA and structured data extraction it used to fail miserably
Let's see how gpt 1.5 works in this direction
[2024-02-15, 22:55:38] Nilesh Transcend: Also curious to know what magic.dev team showed their investors. 117m$ fund raise for a code writing model.
[2024-02-15, 22:56:15] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Not dead but maybe simplified a heck ton. Rather than all the complicated processes to narrow down we pass in the entire thing
[2024-02-15, 22:56:16] Nilesh Transcend: That's why added the recall metric

[2024-02-15, 23:09:06] ~ Ashwin: if this is trained on all the publicly available code (say), does that make it a global-average-developer? no disrespect, but that’s pretty crappy. agree?
[2024-02-15, 23:09:40] ~ Ashwin: and the more new devs rely on this, will mediocrity compound?
[2024-02-15, 23:10:31] Nilesh Transcend: Why do you think they wouldn't curate the dataset? Average quality being mediocre is well known.
[2024-02-15, 23:11:10] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: Synthetic data generation?
[2024-02-15, 23:12:31] Nilesh Transcend: I'd say it might not be necessary.
[2024-02-15, 23:17:32] ~ Ashwin: i’m sure they’ve curated. but it’s quite hard to declare huge swathes of code as meaningfully good (also, subjective since even 2 top devs can and will disagree). so absent a mathematically strong metric, i’m inclined to think it’ll still be average. e.g. by mathematically robust, I’m thinking somethign like what these guys did: https://huggingface.co/blog/leaderboards-on-the-hub-nphardeval
[2024-02-15, 23:19:22] ~ Ashwin: I think that could be an interesting problem LLMs could solve — given user inputs, write a “minimal” code to achieve said task. I can’t think of a way to explain “elegant” to a machine just yet… we’ll probably get there, and it’ll probably not matter if no one other than the machine will read the code

https://vectorize.io/2024/02/16/rag-is-dead-long-live-rag/
[2024-02-17, 09:35:51] Nirant K: RAG is not a solution to the context window problem anyway. It's a solution to generate-over-unseen-context problem. Context windows are a bit like the "number of documents indexed" from early days of search — more about bragging rights than utility after a certain saturation. And there's no competitive advantage, it's a negative sum game.
[2024-02-17, 09:36:56] Maruti Agarwal: I feel the bragging is more of a marketing pitch 😛

[2024-02-17, 09:54:09] Prashant Nolano: Thought Experiment: Train a model on data till 2015. Would it be able to answer complex questions from things that came after 2015, with any form of Retrieval and limited context length like 100K?
Complex queries need deductions of the form a->b->c,  for which we either need to train a model on unseen-data or have a very high context length that retrieval can add enough context that increases the chances of right deductions being present.
[2024-02-17, 09:58:14] Prashant Nolano: On the same note, people fail to consider that embedding based RAG will anyway fail on unseen-data.
Simplest example is that if my data talks a lot about a non general abbreviation say, MRL. No matter how good the embeddings model is, it will not be able to retrieve mrl related docs even for a simple query like 'how does mrl work'
[2024-02-17, 09:58:41] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Found it. It's carrying base model license. Earlier I was checking llama Vicuna base. Thanks.
[2024-02-17, 10:07:52] Nirant K: Yes? I mean, after some level of world building — the best model was GPT4 and till recently it was till 2021 data.
[2024-02-17, 10:09:05] Nirant K: This seems more like a dictionary/vocabulary constraint — and modern LLMs can learn new abbv "in-context", so the claim that you can't mention MRL in context is incomplete. The model forgets what you mention within context also, and that's a problem not unique to new concepts or abbv
[2024-02-17, 10:10:11] Nirant K: The concept "abbv" is not new, and already captured in the world building hopefully

[2024-02-19, 17:59:12] Rohit Aggarwal: While faster is always better - what are current use cases where this fast an inference speed will be useful?

I imagine this definitely paves the way for agents with self reflection to do well since you can remove streaming, and still achieve great responses fast.

Almost all of the developments in speeding up inference will help agentic workflows. What are are areas “being fast” brings across new paradigms?
[2024-02-19, 18:01:34] Sparsh Chutiya Agarwal Nova GenZ: anything with speech to speech responses

[2024-02-19, 18:04:38] Rohit Aggarwal: Yes, what are some use cases that will now become possible because LLM latencies will come closer to regular API latencies?
[2024-02-19, 18:05:10] Rohit Aggarwal: I imagine streaming might become less important which enables chat support companies to implement guardrails better.
[2024-02-19, 18:06:08] Rajaswa Patil: Huge boost to all inline autocomplete features imo - where your completion time has to be close to your debouncing times!

Really goes into the deepest details of client side implementation of autocomplete!
[2024-02-19, 18:27:43] Vignesh Baskaran: Rohit, The primary bottleneck at Hexo, is the latency involved in STT -> LLM -> TTS. In order to overcome this, we need to use Streaming TTS, Streaming LLM and Streaming STT. The code and consequently the deployment is becoming incredibly hard with this. If we can get instantaneous responses without streaming for all the three models in the pipeline, everything in our pipeline will be super simplified and hence we can focus on core value creation and not Devops!

[2024-02-19, 18:31:18] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: I understand that using streaming we can combine LLM Response and TTS response and thus lower the latency. But how are you using Streaming response of STT? Don’t we need to get full result of STT before passing it to LLM? Just curious to know your approach.
[2024-02-19, 18:31:45] Atik Shaikh: Anyone from our community has got access to Gemini 1.5 yet ? ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-19, 18:38:49] Nirant K: This is quite neat. One app which I still think India has a bet at making commercial scale apps is exactly Github Copilot kinda tool — but something which updates around the local code and repo for each company. This is very commercially useful for large Java codebases, which are also quite verbose.

This also has applications for everyone making a package release — if I submit my changelog, I'd like my changes to propagate to the code copilot of all my users if I can.
[2024-02-19, 18:39:26] ~ Sagar: looking at this exact same usecase. We currently are using vocode based STT+LLM+TTS pipeline. But latencies are quiet high if we go for more tokens in agent impl. Nevertheless, we still have limitations in the way voice interafces are built. In STT, one such factor is endpointing latency.
[2024-02-19, 18:41:27] Priyank Agrawal: Interesting how do u solve for endpointing latency??
[2024-02-19, 18:44:25] ~ Sagar: we cant, this is a classic problem with all voice interfaces. Every usecase can afford different endpoint latency and tuning has been the key afaik in industry. We can always, use partial outputs from STT models to minimize this.

[2024-02-19, 18:55:08] ~ Sagar: @32486634341 You are able to run all 3 components in streaming mode? Wouldnt that be costly atleast in terms of resource management. Like for a telephony call, you need to spawn one full dedicated instance of all 3 components.
[2024-02-19, 18:58:17] Amit Tiwary: Isn’t this already very crowded though (at least directionally)? Bloop, Onboard AI, sweep, 50 other YC companies in the last two batches 😅
[2024-02-19, 19:07:23] Nirant K: I see competition as validation that the problem is real and big. I don't care too much about the competition as long as you can get to $100M ARR.
[2024-02-19, 19:07:42] Nirant K: I'm not aiming for Salesforce/Github outcomes
[2024-02-19, 19:14:47] Amit Tiwary: I used to think so too until last week when magic.dev raised like 150 mil from Nat Friedman 🥲
[2024-02-19, 19:15:19] Vignesh Baskaran: Yes Rohit. I built a small prototype which streams outputs from LLM -> TTS and it worked well. But for STT -> LLM there was no point of streaming the input from STT to LLM because anyways the LLM needed the full input to start responding. Therefore I had to use Streaming LLMs (https://github.com/mit-han-lab/streaming-llm) to stream the STT input into it. 

In the meanwhile, we launched the app to 50 people for internal testing and realized that most people did not want a voice interface at all. They just needed a text interface. So we did not go through the effort of streaming at all. So when you use Hexo app right now, it is a HTTP request which responds in a non-streaming mode from STT -> LLM -> TTS. ‎<This message was edited>

There is another tool on block - re-tell.ai
Their Latency is crazy good. They use ML models to figure endpointing. Do try it out. It is not opensource though.

[2024-02-19, 19:27:17] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: Most of their cost is because of underlying LLM, STT and TTS stack.
[2024-02-19, 19:27:44] Sachit Sharma: Yeah, elevenlabs is the major contributor
[2024-02-19, 19:28:57] ~ Nikhil Pareek-Future AGI: As we have observed, a successful AI application does not rely on a single AI or a single layer of AI; instead, it utilizes multiple layers of AI, with each one performing a specific task, leading to the final output or some post-processing pipeline. Similarly, Large Language Models (LLMs) are situated within the middle layer.

For instance, an image processing sequence might involve image preprocessing, followed by image OCR, then an LLM to interpret the data, and finally, post-processing of the data/rag, among other steps.

This approach is applicable to voice processing pipelines, agent/RAG pipelines, or future applications.

Each step needs to be rapid, and historically, LLMs have been a bottleneck in this process based on the token size. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-19, 19:29:34] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: They are also supporting OpenAI TTS stack and have reduced the pricing to half for that.

[2024-02-19, 19:44:35] Priyank Agrawal: Interesting but how much time did this save? Asking Coz logically even if you stream input to LLM you have to wait for the last token to be streamed in before you can start getting the LLM response (that take care of the entire msg/input
[2024-02-19, 19:46:54] Priyesh OnFinance: +1, very curious
[2024-02-19, 19:58:46] Vignesh Baskaran: I haven't dove deeper into Streaming LLMs implementation to give the following answer. But anyways I am gonna answer: To the best of my understanding Streaming LLMs can start generating output as they slide through the input. Therefore they need not wait for the last input token to be streamed in. This could be entirely wrong, but this is my understanding of the paper. Long ago, I created a GPT to understand this paper: https://chat.openai.com/g/g-ypnb8kGcC-streaming-llm-teacher. I hope it still works.

This being said, just by streaming the LLM output into TTS and then streaming the output of TTS, we saved immense time because generating a 30 second audio using OpenAI TTS usually takes 30 seconds. But if I stream, it is almost instantaneous. I can share my script if you need 🙂  Because OpenAI's TTS streaming docs is not straightforward to use
[2024-02-19, 20:05:03] Priyank Agrawal: Ok thanks, i think steaming is fairly straightforward stuff these days. But streaming LLM input was a new dimension. Thanks for sharing, appreciate it!

Scenario: I have structured data set on which I want to provide capability to ask and answer questions. Questions can be straightforward or may require some complex computation
Issue: Code-interpreter is a black box. It takes 15~20s for a response. Often fails to load/reload dataset. Sometimes has issues with data types and is not taking in instructions from the prompt to understand the data being passed to it

I see there is TTS dot Bhashini portal but no proper information on Speech To Text part.
[2024-02-20, 11:37:34] Rakeshkumar Waghela: Use case I'm trying to experiment for.

Lots of hinglish audio files, transcribed in text.

Then.. if AI god's permits and bhashini gives decent hinglish text the some analysis on that text.
[2024-02-20, 11:37:55] Rakeshkumar Waghela: * to be transcribed in text

[2024-02-20, 11:38:33] Rakeshkumar Waghela: Tried some paid APIs and some facility of AWS.

None is good enough for hinglish.

[2024-02-20, 19:39:07] Varshul Dubverse: Yeah the problem is the phoneme to grapheme conversion with most approaches, works in one language not in code switching.

Elevenlabs quality should be good. Widely reported the best.

For Hinglish you can try Dubverse voices on our product. Talknet based not so large models. Available in 10 Indian languages. Used by 1M users :)

Also our large scale models we're building on OSS, just not hyping up rn but sharing since multiple folks asked for it. Checkout here and give it a spin - https://github.com/dubverse-ai/MahaTTS
[2024-02-20, 19:53:46] Sachit Sharma: We've created our own dataset using YouTube podcasts and are currently training with a limited hours of data to evaluate the outcomes. Should the initial results prove successful, we plan to extend training to larger datasets(crowd source, YouTube etc). We are doing this for some internal use case of ours, due to the high costs of existing models - eleven labs, playht.

We're open to collaboration if anyone from this group interested in joining us.

At present, we are collaborating with a group of students from IISC Bangalore.

[2024-02-20, 20:42:42] Vetrivel PS: Guys

I was exploring on this topic:

Talk to csv files using LLMs. 

There were 2 approaches :

1. Use csv agent from langchain and query/perform analysis in python. Very simple n straight forward.

2. Another approach used RAG based system involving embeddings,  vector store, retriever etc

2nd approach is time consuming n comparatively complicated approach.

Which one is preferred and when ? 

I infact,I  want to question why at all 2nd approach exists? Am I missing something here ?
[2024-02-20, 20:48:46] ~ Krishna: Doesn't the CSV agent from langchain suck? Don't remember correctly but had something to do with it not fetching sufficient data from the CSV to give to the llm. 

I had to use a custom agent for a POC last year
[2024-02-20, 20:52:05] Azhan Mohammed Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Hey, could we maybe talk a bit in depth about how you did this?
[2024-02-20, 21:01:10] Vetrivel PS: So what was your approach like ?😀
[2024-02-20, 21:09:27] ~ Krishna: I'm no pro but I noticed that langchain agents are just a series of prompts. The prompt for the python repl tool was not optimised and failed at understanding basic requirements. 

So I used the CSV agent code as a base and changed a lot of the prompts and python code at some places in that package to change the way it used tools. 
I was adamant at using just gpt3.5 tho
[2024-02-20, 22:18:39] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: There’s another approach 
If your csv is properly formatted then load the csv in a SQLite local db 

Then talk to data with agent becomes slightly easier as text2sql is pretty good or you can drop in any code finetuned model for sql generation
[2024-02-20, 22:24:19] ~ Vijay RPS: Guys
  Please let me know ur approaches if anyone has implemented visual search at Scale.Which base embeddings did u use to finetune on your data?Thanks

[2024-02-20, 22:42:08] ~ Kunal Singhal: text2sql is often not enough, there would be situations when the question will contain names or literals that don’t exactly match the data.

[2024-02-21, 19:40:12] Nirant K: They'll wait till Monday I think
[2024-02-21, 19:42:30] ~ Abhinash Khare: These OSS models will do more for Google than what gemini did  for them in terms of perception
[2024-02-21, 19:44:05] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: they claim to surpass llama/mistral family of models, pretty excited to try them out

So we have llama from meta, phi from microsoft, and now gemma from google.

open source ftw !🔥
[2024-02-21, 20:31:47] Nirant K: Model weights proving heading to commodity faster than I'd have expected. I'd estimated 3 years in April 2023
[2024-02-21, 20:36:08] ~ Shreya Vajpei: Is there any literature on how specific gen AI tools have better adoption than general purpose ones ?

Give it a try yourselves!!
[2024-02-21, 21:06:21] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: very cool !
seems like its a paid feature on tune.app, right ?

congrats also on the rebranding !

And also to generate model images wearing your products?

[2024-02-22, 00:07:29] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yeah, I was having discussion with @919550164716 that 256K may be not good for inference compared to llama2 of same size models but it can have a good benchmark for Indic
[2024-02-22, 00:07:31] Ravi Theja: @919915123897 has done

[2024-02-22, 00:15:22] ~ Ajay: Have folks here working with mid sized company and enterprises heard from them that they want to use Open Source models because it's cheaper than using GPT-4? Is that even a valid statement? ( Cost of maintaining infra for the models vs serverless per toke cost with GPT-4 )
[2024-02-22, 00:17:33] Prakash Sankar Harbor: what is cost though? a big fear that a lot of people have is privacy
[2024-02-22, 00:19:57] Prakash Sankar Harbor: to run Mixtral (for example), which is decently close to GPT-4, you need roughly 300GB of diskspace and 8 GPUs - on Cloud that's gonna cost about 20K a year. But to do it robustly, you probably need a load balancer or something
[2024-02-22, 00:19:59] Prakash Sankar Harbor: so maybe 40K a year
[2024-02-22, 00:20:04] Prakash Sankar Harbor: but it depends on the usage right?
[2024-02-22, 00:20:42] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Is mistral medium available OSS
[2024-02-22, 00:20:53] Prakash Sankar Harbor: no
[2024-02-22, 00:21:33] Sachin Legaltech: https://x.com/prajdabre1/status/1760323405268635726 Raj Dabre did analysis of fertility of gemma model for Indic languages. Fertility is average number of tokens created per word.
[2024-02-22, 00:23:45] ~ Ajay: Privacy here meaning their private data being leaked because they use Open AI's ( or Claude's) ) APIs?
[2024-02-22, 00:23:56] Prakash Sankar Harbor: yes
[2024-02-22, 00:23:59] Prakash Sankar Harbor: it's a huge problem for enterprise
[2024-02-22, 00:24:07] Prakash Sankar Harbor: you won't build a good business selling to enterprise without hosting a model
[2024-02-22, 00:24:09] Prakash Sankar Harbor: on their prem
[2024-02-22, 00:25:07] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: 256k what?
[2024-02-22, 00:27:29] Prakash Sankar Harbor: in general this also makes me wonder about openai's valuation - cos a good chunk of that valuation is coming from enabling a large number of businesses who are going to keep using the API. So it's valued as both a consumer tech company and as an enterprise B2B company
[2024-02-22, 00:27:39] Prakash Sankar Harbor: a consumer tech company will generally be more valuable
[2024-02-22, 00:27:57] Nirant K: 256K vocab size, with a lot of those empty — possibly for allowing better finetuning
[2024-02-22, 00:29:41] Nirant K: ‎You deleted this message.
[2024-02-22, 00:30:03] Prakash Sankar Harbor: depends on the task man
[2024-02-22, 00:30:25] Prakash Sankar Harbor: but anyways, point stands - if you want to sell to enterprise, get comfortable hosting
[2024-02-22, 00:46:58] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: https://twitter.com/awnihannun/status/1760336086226907311 gemma ported to mlx also!
[2024-02-22, 01:00:34] ~ Ajay: I'm not sure I understand your point. Are you saying GPT-4 is not a good enough model for enterprises? Or are you saying there is a possibility of data leak that worries enterprises?
[2024-02-22, 01:00:49] Prakash Sankar Harbor: the latter
[2024-02-22, 01:02:22] ~ Ajay: Why is this specific to Azure Open AI ( or other closed models on the cloud )? Why can't an enterprise also then have problems with cloud database or cloud analytics products?
[2024-02-22, 01:02:39] Prakash Sankar Harbor: beats me man, go talk to them
[2024-02-22, 01:02:52] Prakash Sankar Harbor: I'm just passing on what I've learned talking to enterprises, I don't argue with the market
[2024-02-22, 01:03:13] Prakash Sankar Harbor: it's sort of like arguing with an earthquake - what's the point?
[2024-02-22, 01:05:28] ~ Ajay: I'm not trying to argue as much as just trying to understand if there's a legitimate concern here ( beyond like you said that the sentiment is clear )
[2024-02-22, 01:06:19] Ankur Pandey: It's not yes/no. LLMs are new for enterprise so policies are not clear.

And while a fintech, medical company may want a self hosted model, others might be okay with soc2 etc
[2024-02-22, 01:07:03] Prakash Sankar Harbor: I'm saying it doesn't matter. What you or I feel or think is rational is irrelevant. Go talk to the market and find out is the only way to figure this out. Maybe the corner of the market I am talking to is different from the corner of the market you are addressing
[2024-02-22, 01:07:21] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: yeah pharma it is tough to share data - pii concerns all that.
[2024-02-22, 01:07:24] Prakash Sankar Harbor: I am talking to large enterprises - this is the concern they have.
[2024-02-22, 01:07:53] Prakash Sankar Harbor: this could also change as tastes change in the future, but I need to build my business for the market today not at some unspecified future time right

[2024-02-22, 02:40:35] ~ Nutan: Wanted to understand if procreate allows real time collaboration ? I cant seem to find anything like that online... procreate doesnt allow real time collaboration... 

Also if it doesnt then why hasnt it been done so far... is it technically super tough to enable it ?? 

Also artists can remotely still collab by just sending over files but is that the reason it has not been implemented ?
[2024-02-22, 02:50:27] ~ CK: As a person in the design field , I never really had a need for this.
[2024-02-22, 03:05:43] ~ Nutan: Okay so when u need to collaborate you just share the file ? Then they download it  and locally add to it?

[2024-02-22, 09:00:29] Anshul Bhide Replit: Based on what I’ve seen, they prefer doing POCs with open source on prem LLMs. Because this is upto the BUs discretion and each BU needs to do a POC to get budget.

But if and when it moves to production, they’d like the LLM to be hosted in the cloud based on the hyperscaler they’re already using. So openAI for azure, Bard / Palm for GCP etc.

[2024-02-22, 10:56:49] ~ Raghu Venkat: Hi, I am Raghu, mostly been a programmer/product guy for over 20+ years. Worked in CBOT, CBOE, etc. among other places in the US (I consider Chicago my second home still) and headed tech for a healthcare analytics company / did my own embedded finance start-up here in India. 

I can break my career into two parts - before I learned XP/Unit Testing around 2002-3 and after XP! I am test-infested. 

Currently, I am an advisor at Numberz.ai (full disclosure - my wife Tricha runs it). Specific to LLMs/GenAI - I want to learn/contribute to how to bring the testing angle (similar to mock-data/stub/skeleton/fake types thinking). Very interested in “Synthetic data”. 

Great to be part of this group. Special thanks to Pranjal Mehta for adding me (And Amrutash for suggesting the group). I am based out of Koramangala, Bangalore.

[2024-02-22, 11:31:04] ~ Tricha: Hello all.  Glad to be part of this group. I am Tricha - did my undergrad at IIT Bombay / PhD from GaTech. Was mostly in the academics for 20+ years. Was part of the founding team at IIITB for setting up the Upgrad courses for ML/AI. Currently took the plunge to do my own thing - Numberz.ai (need help from everyone!) - consulting + building products around AI/ML. The first use case we have taken up is Equity Reports / Analysis. My specific interests in GenAI revolve around thinking in the “Pragmatic” angle - how I can demystify and simplify things (all things AI actually from Regression to CNN/RNN). I love to teach - recently did a master class in Infosys foundation. Happy to be part of this group. I am based out of Bangalore.
[2024-02-22, 11:31:49] Nirant K: Please don't introduce yourself. 20 introductions doesn't help 1k people here 🙏🏽
[2024-02-22, 11:32:36] C Chaitanya: They did. For a long time. Even now a lot of enterprises want on premise solutions. But over time, they learnt to trust cloud database etc. Cloud AI has another problem, how can you validate an answer returned by a cloud AI. You cannot even reproduce it. Why should an enterprise trust it?
[2024-02-22, 11:35:53] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: meta post by karpathy on technical accessibility

your solution can be technically brilliant, but it's adoption by others requires building an on-ramp for others to engage with your solution !

https://huggingface.co/spaces/badayvedat/LLaVA
[2024-02-22, 16:06:23] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: I think the privacy is a concern but enterprises are very comfortable working with Azure (don’t know why). So this was how I understood their relationship. OpenAI targets developers and azure is for enterprises.
Other than privacy another big use case is trying to generate text that would not be allowed by OpenAI. Not necessarily illegal stuff but like dialogues for intimate scenes that are part of legit series or shows.

[2024-02-22, 22:20:25] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: the major challenge in scraping is stuff like rotating proxies. Sure you can write , but I'll prefer something like scrapingbee with a basic scraper as backup in case credits of scrapingbee expire, for tasks, saves a lot of time
[2024-02-22, 22:23:09] ~ prakashpvss: If you are looking to scrape from few tens of websites genai might not be required. A simple xpath would suffice. But if you are looking to be template independent and want to scale across thousands of websites providing html along with I'd and class attributes and performing a qna for closedIE will work in most of the cases. Some preprocessing on html can reduce input context length.

[2024-02-22, 23:27:09] Rahul Deora: Using requests.get(url), put this in a function and then used multiprocessing for a list of urls
[2024-02-22, 23:27:25] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Anyone working on GenAI solution that goes through the entire mailbox and efficiently achieves zero inbox? Should be easy to build using embeddings and then low-cost GPT3.5 APIs. I would pay one-time ~50$ if helps me achieve that.

This Colab notebook (Free tier), talks about loading and running Gemma model and showcases how to run inference in JAX using the Transformers library. 

They've compiled the generate call using jax.pmap, giving XLA-optimised kernels for TPU. The result was generation speeds of 475 tokens per second, around 4x faster than on equivalent GPU hardware.

Also, It's worth noting that the Cloud TPU v2s used in the Google Colab free-tier are now 3 generations old. Running the same code on the latest TPU hardware (e.g. TPU v4 or v5e) gives a significant performance gain compared to older generation v2s. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-02-23, 12:36:22] Lucifer 😎: Good Afternoon Folks,
What's the best / go-to method to compare the similarity b/w 2 asymmetric context text

Query - can be 3-6 words at max
Context - can be around 1000+ words 

Normal semantic contextual similarity doesn't perform good. 

My plan is to finetune an embedding model to get good representation of the embedding and maybe then I'll have something fruitful

Any other way ?
Thanks

that techniques like Chain of Thought can be generalised to a problem solving and planning ability in LLMs.

There’s a popular view that the most revenue generating product for OpenAI is CoT 🤪
[2024-02-23, 14:02:17] Vignesh Baskaran: Hi Ajay,
I have done it multiple times. Here is the trick of making it work:
1. Read your CSV into a Pandas dataframe
2. Convert it into Markdown. My intuition is that OAI has convert all or most of their training data into Markdown
3. Pass it as context and start querying
I also wrote a small Pseudocode to illustrate this: https://gist.github.com/VigneshHexo/9275b2168fb48f8054ff0ea43fa730cb

If this still doesn't work, here are the options for you to debug:
1. Check if the whole table is passed into the context or not. Just make sure you don't have data.sample() or data.head(1) in your code
2. Throw away most of your columns and rows. Retain only a small number of them (for instance 3 columns and 4 rows) and retry querying. The idea is to keep the problem constrained enough for you to experiment

[2024-02-23, 20:01:12] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: Some of ours are not so lean because they lay out a bunch of one/few shot nuances & formats for our highly controlled output. 

And token size becomes key only now that we are using GPT4 for some of them (Finetuning is not a top priority rn, recent models are capable enough).

[2024-02-24, 21:27:16] Priyesh OnFinance: For this what I have found best ia to generate multiple Qs from the context.
[2024-02-24, 21:27:18] Priyesh OnFinance: Based on the core idea that embedding models are garbage at embedding long length ctx efficiently and move around the average
[2024-02-24, 21:27:19] Priyesh OnFinance: For retrieval u want max discrimination/polarization of chunk ctx into atomic units
[2024-02-24, 21:27:20] Priyesh OnFinance: I think I had mentioned earlier during the txt2sql arc of this group about the markdown glitch but basically, its that markdown delimiters are clearer for AI models to hold in attn window

[2024-02-24, 22:07:44] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: https://lightning.ai/lightning-ai/studios/understanding-using-and-finetuning-gemma

By Sebastian Raschka

1) Gemma uses a really large vocabulary and consequently embedding weight matrices.

2) Like OLMo and GPT-2, Gemma also uses weight tying.

3) It even uses GeLU (in the form of GeGLU), similar to GPT-2, unlike Llama 2 and other LLMs.

4) Interestingly, Gemma normalizes the embeddings by the square root of the hidden layer dimension.

5) The RMSNorm layers are in the usual location, different from what was hinted at in the technical paper.

6) However, the RMSNorm implementation comes with the unit offset that wasn't mentioned in the technical paper. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-02-24, 22:23:10] Adithya S K PESIT: I feel continual pretraining on gemma for different languages will be more effective when compared to llama+extended vocabulary
[2024-02-24, 22:23:36] Priyesh OnFinance: Why? I didnt seem tonfigure this out
[2024-02-24, 22:23:41] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: yeah. for sure - we can experiment and see how they are compared to llama2 etc
[2024-02-24, 22:24:34] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: The large vocabulary size of 256,000 words (in contrast, Llama has a vocabulary of 32,000 words);
The extensive 6 trillion token training dataset (Llama was trained on only one-third of that amount). 

this could be a factor
[2024-02-24, 22:38:30] Adithya S K PESIT: in my opinion vocabular extension in the tokenizer is a problem 
even though the tokenizer efficience goes up significantly 
these new tokens will be seen by the model for the first time

when I was training ambari (kannada bilingual) I did a version with vocabular extension and the other without

even tho the tokenisation was bad that model significantly performed better than the one with tokenizer extension

with gemma we don't have to worry about adding new tokens to the vocabular as its already 50 to 60% more efficient than llamas tokenizer

[2024-02-24, 23:47:00] ~ Apurva Bhatt: I have a question about how autoregressive models (AR) work, let's say GPT-2. We have an input string of 500 words(or 740 tokens). 
1. AR model reads one window of words and starts predicting the output without reading the whole input, the model keeps on sequentially reading the windows and predicting the output.
2. AR model reads the whole input in one go and start predicting the output until EOS token is predicted.
[2024-02-25, 00:45:56] Nirant K: The second. That's why the input tokens can't be streamed easily.
[2024-02-25, 10:34:12] Harveen Singh Chaddha: If I had GPU’s I would try the following:

1. Train tokenizer on your text of intended language.
2. ⁠find tokens not common with gemmas vocab.
3. ⁠replace unused tokens in gemma vocab with tokens from step 2
4. ⁠continual pretrain
5. ⁠sft

There is already some discussion here:

[2024-02-25, 10:36:05] Shan: What’s the specific question
[2024-02-25, 10:45:51] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: I feel like if the newly added tokens don't see as much pre training data as the already present tokens, the correlations dont occure and the efficiency reduces severely
[2024-02-25, 11:10:53] ~ Anukriti: i am doing entity extraction from streaming voice data, the current pipeline is STT (whisper) , make an API call to mistral/gpt3.5 every n words collected .
is there a more efficient way ?
[2024-02-25, 11:16:25] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: how does mistral entity extraction compare to normal entity ml extractors - say using spacy entity detectors ?
[2024-02-25, 11:22:35] ~ Anukriti: currently providing the expected  schema in prompt (entities are product id, category name etc. ) in case of mistral, tbh, have not explored spacy for this , gpt3.5 function calling works well

[2024-02-25, 13:38:33] Nirant K: Yeah the pipeline makes a ton of sense — needs patience more than GPU. You can go pretty far with A100s I think, which most orgs can afford.
[2024-02-25, 13:39:47] Nirant K: Function Calling can be streamed from OpenAI Models — assuming you meant faster by efficient, and not token reduction, which is a different thing altogether
[2024-02-25, 13:41:09] Nirant K: spaCy allows you to use LLMs for NER via their APIs fwiw: https://spacy.io/api/large-language-models#ner

By their own, quite robust eval suite — it's 15% absolute better, that's quite big for NER where the annual progress upto T5 used to be like 1-2%
[2024-02-25, 14:12:56] ~ Ajay: @917737887058 thank you for your suggestion on using the Azure AI for Document markdown output for pdf files with ChatGPT/GPT-4 It clearly did best in my tests compared with unstructured ( JSON ) and Llama Parse. ( Also thank you to @32486634341 for pointing out how in isolation to best convert the table to markdown ) 

Follow up question - does the same file format/conversion work best with llama-2-70B-chat as well or are there any specific quirks on the llama-2 side? ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-02-25, 15:51:54] ~ Ajay: I mean to chat "with my pdf" using GPT-4, I converted it into the markdown format using Azure AI for Documents ( the pdf contains tables, figures, reports, etc. ). And that worked really well. Can I do exactly the same thing and chat with llama-2-chat? Or have you seen the conversion from pdf to markdown with Azure AI for Document not be the best way to do it?

[2024-02-25, 21:38:58] Hasan Tech Art: I have also been trying to make sense of shift. From what I have understood till now is that the technologies we invented solved transportation, processing and storage of information. I can communicate with anyone anywhere instantly but still the technology works like a dumb delivery mechanism. WhatsApp doesn’t know the context of the conversation we are having, gmail handles mail. Sheets manage tables and images/videos all are just different containers to store and transfer information. Now we are moving to a paradigm where the system’s understand the context of the information being stored and transferred. The mediums are becoming interchangeable without human effort and changing specific parameters like style, length, mood etc are changeable individually. This will require new ways of thinking and inventing new interfaces and mediums which can utilise these capabilities.
[2024-02-25, 22:06:16] Paras Chopra Wingify: It probably just means computers used to follow their instructions, now they’re trying to guess intent and execute on it

[2024-02-26, 09:05:32] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Great read !
tl/dr : stand alone models alone are not the binding constraint on great ai systems, 
model + system architecture + ops(monitoring/observability) + sw engg will make ai systems *work well*.

Maybe a *great model*, with mediocre system arch & other components <<< (could be beaten by) a decent model + good system arch + good ops + good sw engg

@919315659680 what were your takeaways from the blog ?
Do you think perplexity (or some other system) embodies the qualities of a *good* compound ai system ?

maybe naive thinking, but IMHO, in really good compound ai systems e.g. like google maps real time travel prediction, the model actually fades away from the core ux and becomes transparent.
(Good tech fades into the background - Alan Kay ?)
So i would add the following attributes to a *good* compound ai system:
1. good deign/hci/ux skills are also an essential component.
2. ⁠trial/error, empirical sweep of tunable knobs to find the one with optimal performance(choice of model, chunk size, choice of hyper params, etc)
3. ⁠evolve & improve over time (incorporate human & other implicit feedback cleanly)
[2024-02-26, 09:07:47] Hemant Mohapatra: I had the same takeaways. A dumb LLM + smart scaffolding may be better than trying to fine tune or train a smart LLM to use without the same scaffolding.
[2024-02-26, 09:11:04] Prakash Sankar Harbor: I don't understand why this is a great article. Isn't it basically saying that LLMs are one part of your system, build your product around the LLM and do w/e it takes to give your user a good product experience.

I mean with the stage even GPT-4 is at and given LLMs are inherently probabilistic functions isn't this always going to be the case?
[2024-02-26, 09:12:02] Prakash Sankar Harbor: if you want to use them to replace processes in an intelligent way, then ya, you need to build around them - but I feel like anybody building products with them could tell you this
[2024-02-26, 09:12:05] Pratyush Choudhury: Counter question- beauty of SaaS & API movement has been around thoughtful abstractions for the end user or a dev to perform tasks without caring too much about what's under the hood. 

The complex AI architecture turns that on its head and creates more points of failure?
[2024-02-26, 09:16:54] Rajesh Parikh Cynepia: That's not the right way to find the binary SaaS vs AI. We called out integrated approach much before in December when Sanjeev and I published the trends for this year. BAIR paper is only a validation of that. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-26, 09:17:33] Rajesh Parikh Cynepia: There's a good alchemy at play here. Just like sql engines, models are another set of engines that play in an overall system or application architectures
[2024-02-26, 09:18:18] Rajesh Parikh Cynepia: Unlike what is a common belief that AI is eating software , we see most early outcomes are adding layers of software around model.
[2024-02-26, 09:18:51] Rajesh Parikh Cynepia: Most likely scenario is it will be finding best of both worlds and both eating each other where their strengths lie
[2024-02-26, 09:19:27] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: maybe i will temper my excitement :)
the piece just articulated & helped reinforce some of my own mental models around what makes a *great system* vs a *great model* and we shuld be cautious of conflating the two.

on the hci/ux/design on integrating the model with the surrounding *system scaffolding*, i would posit that natural language inputs for LLMs are suboptimal for most usecases, (its just the dominant one right now, but its transient) and we need to come up with newer ux affordances, very usecase& domain driven - i would imagine, prompted by reading this excellent piece :

[2024-02-26, 09:25:15] Rajesh Parikh Cynepia: Easiest way to find value on where we are heading in one line as Tim Cook called out is 'thought to action' whatever it takes to get there. Integrated data and AI platform aand AI Agents/Agencies (compound ai systems as Berkeley calls it) are 2 possible systemic architectures to reduce friction to deployment. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-02-26, 09:27:24] Rajesh Parikh Cynepia: Success will be seen on how creators find a perfect alchemy of sorts with all tools at hand
[2024-02-26, 09:28:41] Sourasis Roy: True. No point falling in love with LLMs blindly. Their usage needs to justify gtm speed, cost, roi etc and timely compromises are critically important here

But lately I have been thinking what happens if 1million token inferencing cost comes down to let's say $0.003 . Do we still need a retrieval for most of the applications
[2024-02-26, 09:30:04] Sourasis Roy: so certain  pillars of compounding maybe temporary
[2024-02-26, 09:39:15] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: and does scaling continue to hold up ? till when ?
[2024-02-26, 09:43:26] Sourasis Roy: Not sure. maybe the underlying hardware iterates and becomes drastically cheaper. But so far nothing suggests that the current pricing is anywhere close to final.
[2024-02-26, 09:44:11] Sourasis Roy: but definitely it will take several years to reach there if at all
[2024-02-26, 10:20:25] Nirant K: It's a great article because it makes people feel heard — and it gives names to the idea you just described. Humans like nouns — that's why we've a name for the colour "blue", which we didn't have 5K years ago. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-02-26, 14:22:25] ~ Ganaraj: I tried launching bge in hugging face last week ( paid inference ). While it deployed it on a GPU machine, it doesn't use GPU at all. So, it's quite slow and unusable
[2024-02-26, 14:25:07] Nirant K: For other readers: Huggingface Infra is not a reflection of the model itself
[2024-02-26, 14:26:43] ~ Ganaraj: Anyone from hugging face here who can look into this? 😅
[2024-02-26, 14:27:34] Ambika Computational Mama: oh - did you make your own build or was it directly through the inference api stuff
[2024-02-26, 14:27:51] Nirant K: Huggingface folks are pretty active on Twitter/X, probably you can tweet to them directly. Wouldn't want this forum to be another support channel for them
[2024-02-26, 14:28:07] Ankur Goel: *Hackathon style question*
I've been working with Game designers. one of the challenge I see is that they don't know how to separate theme/setting of the game from the mechanics. I want to make a simple bot where they can input a whole theme of the game with the mechanics they're thinking. I should be able to isolate the mechanics part from it and show them similar game made on those mechanics. 

For POC: I am thinking of creating a small database of games(name, link and description of mechanics) and create a chatbot where anyone can enter their prompt and I can show them game whose mechanics matches most of what they described.
If you were to hack this together in half a day, how will you do it?
[2024-02-26, 14:28:47] ~ Ganaraj: Directly, click, click, click launch
[2024-02-26, 14:29:45] Ambika Computational Mama: Accha, I think you can check more on the blogs instead of the docs  - occasionally they will highlight issues that people have faced
[2024-02-26, 14:30:15] ~ Shashank Shekhar: Cohere performs slightly better than BGE with Open AI embeddings. For open source LLMs, Cohere performs significantly better (tried for Zephyr and instructor set of embeddings
[2024-02-26, 14:30:23] ~ Palash: Create a custom GPT and open it up for usage?
The generation of the list also can happen with GPT 4 itself
[2024-02-26, 14:30:47] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Any place to play around with this ? Seems promising
[2024-02-26, 14:32:53] Nirant K: Speaking of re-ranking and OSS embeddings: 

Most OSS embeddings fine-tuned on in-domain data will beat most things off the shelf. I've seen 200 triplet fine-tuning samples do the trick in a case of good luck too. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-26, 14:33:08] ~ Ganaraj: Are you talking about reranking ?
[2024-02-26, 14:34:03] Ankur Goel: Thanks. Let me look into this.
[2024-02-26, 14:34:17] Nirant K: If you can actually model this as a classical retrieval and retrieval augmented generation or a rag system whether retrieval or on the gameplay is built on a specific embedding which is aware that this is a game, a mechanic description or something else and you use that to retrieve and rank your results and then an LM which verifies these and connects the dot to the actual question and conversation so far.

Since I'm pressed for time I would probably use the perplexity online chat API and not even build my own database or use the open AIGPT 4 models with web to do this so that the verification part of this is quite fast in terms of dev time.
[2024-02-26, 14:36:57] ~ Ganaraj: Is there any work on using matryoshka embeddings for these OSS? So that I can still use 256 embeddings instead of the huge ones that come with OSS?
[2024-02-26, 14:38:58] Nirant K: I believe Sentence Transformers and Jina are working on MRL models.
[2024-02-26, 14:39:24] Nirant K: Nomic has one too already? v1.5 english
‎[2024-02-26, 14:40:47] Nirant K: ‎image omitted
[2024-02-26, 14:44:40] ~ Shashank Shekhar: Yes. On both MRR and Hit rate Cohere reranker outperforms BGE
[2024-02-26, 14:47:35] ~ Ganaraj: I agree on this. What I'm confused is about why/how open ai embedding comes into picture here ? I was under the impression that rerankers work on raw text ?
[2024-02-26, 14:48:12] ~ Shashank Shekhar: https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/embeddings
[2024-02-26, 14:49:26] Ankur Goel: Perplexity looks like it'll be a faster solution for a basic POC. Thanks a bunch.

[2024-02-26, 15:43:08] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Has anyone found a way to do this on stable diffusion btw? Dalle is expensive and animated pictures only.

Apart from making Lora or dreambooths with images of a person. Is there any other way?
[2024-02-26, 15:43:59] ~ Ganaraj: Not at all. I for one atleast definitely did not know that you could do this.

[2024-02-26, 16:38:42] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: https://www.scenario.com/ 

This one? Those are animated game characters?
[2024-02-26, 17:20:46] Dhruv Anand: Does anyone know of efficient models/libraries to do OCR on videos? Looking for something more sophisticated than keyframe extraction+tesseract. Something that detects animated text (text getting written out character-by-character/word-by-word), and processes the minimal number of frames to get the actual text.
[2024-02-26, 18:53:34] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Scenario and Dashtoon both allow you to do this with a mix of Lora’s and IP adapters. Feel free to try on dashtoon, you can train with one image with dashtoon. 

This genid thing is actually seed and prompt sharing. We also started with this over stable diffusion but it doesn’t work on as many characters we needed 😅 ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-02-26, 20:53:48] Soumyadeep Mukherjee: Try it yourself. Multiple reasons from my experience
- you can only describe things uniquely to a limit using prompts 
- ⁠even if you describe heavily, consistency will come if the prompt alignment is super high. Despite midj level alignment, humans expect way way more when it comes to characters. 
- ⁠seed is just a make shift proxy of some level of consistency as you traverse the latent space

[2024-02-26, 21:11:37] Sachin Legaltech: https://sites.google.com/view/genie-2024/home.   Deepmind released a detailed paper about training foundational interactive video generation model. They train 11B autoregressive next frame prediction model, spatio-temporal aware tokenizer, latent action model to condition the next frame generation (This is just training artifact. Don't need it for inference, except knowledge of available user actions). Their examples look quite cool and they claim to be able to generate 16 seconds worth of video at 10 fps.

If the dataset was immediately removed, is it not responding now with the same response?
If yes, after removing the dataset did you fine tune again? So fast?
Or is the response being generated with a RAG pipeline so when you remove dataset that response does not come?
[2024-02-27, 08:54:56] Nirant K: Yes, it's most likely to be RAG then
[2024-02-27, 08:57:51] ~ Amit Sharma: This is a million $ question. I doubt if the whole concept is settled, so effectiveness measurement is still sometime away. Copilot UX = ChatGPT style Q&A text box, some canned CTA's and a left hand / floating bar of history of your queries / chats. Perplexity is trying to innovate here but not too different. Would love to hear from others.

The future of fixing bugs?

Just record them.

I filmed 3 separate bugs in an app and gave the videos to Gemini 1.5 Pro with my entire codebase.

It correctly identified & fixed each one.

AI is improving insanely fast.

[2024-02-27, 10:57:29] Nirant K: cc @919952465050 @919915123897 would you happen to know someone better than Pratik dada at Indic TTS?
[2024-02-27, 10:59:34] Sourasis Roy: can't wait to get access to it. This can be automated right? write code and let the AI fix everything up after that
[2024-02-27, 11:00:18] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Getting inbounds for Haryanwi, Bhojpuri and other dialects. It can be a game changer if done right.
[2024-02-27, 11:15:48] Nirant K: Lot of these projects are uncertainty bound than talent, money or data to be honest e.g. I have the skills to make a bhojpuri dataset + fine-tune TTS, but I don't know how to make $10K from it  — so I'll skip it completely
[2024-02-27, 11:16:14] ~ Shyam: https://llmtimecapsule.octo.ai/

LLM Time capsule - tracking state of the art LLMs.
[2024-02-27, 11:27:10] C Chaitanya: +1 for this. I have a TTS team sitting in my company, but its cheaper to just use Google or Azure. But I think Eleven labs pricing and the hype of AI, now we see some commercial interest for Indian language TTS. But even there, we see demand only for Hindi and maybe Tamil and Telugu.
[2024-02-27, 11:29:51] Nirant K: Very bullish on Tamil & Telugu — has applications in higher purchasing power states within India and US as well
[2024-02-27, 11:31:55] C Chaitanya: Yes. Seriously thinking of creating a quality TTS and maybe an ASR, open source model. Discussing with couple of teams. Will update and ask for help here :)
[2024-02-27, 11:32:22] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yeah, my use case is grounded to this, so if someone who has already figured out and want to score some social impact brownie points, please let me know.
[2024-02-27, 11:40:33] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: If you have tried it before, what size of dataset one will need for decent tuning?

[2024-02-27, 11:43:07] C Chaitanya: Havent tried with the new approaches. The TTS we had built was old school stuff and needed lesser data but more single person studio quality recording of fixed utterances.
We will be doing a training run with around 50 hours of data. Will update here of the status. Unfortunately have to do all this with volunteer effort and time. Ozonetel fortunately/unfortunately has a different business :)
[2024-02-27, 11:43:39] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Do we have DubVerse or NeoDub folks in the group?

[2024-02-27, 11:51:46] C Chaitanya: Awesome, getting a volunteer driven compute cluster going(Ozonetel has a couple of GPUs, other orgs have also said they will donate compute). Will connect with you. BTW, do you have the dataset or need a dataset also?
[2024-02-27, 11:55:12] Ravi Theja: Is this effort with swecha organisation?
[2024-02-27, 11:56:00] C Chaitanya: Yes. Along with other small efforts I am doing. As long as it is open source, I am in :)
[2024-02-27, 11:56:46] C Chaitanya: trying to get a college consortium going too for compute. But that might take longer.
[2024-02-27, 13:02:58] ~ Chiradeep Vittal: Is there any qualitative difference between different providers (anyscale, together, etc) apart from speed/latency? That is, for the same prompt, Llama-7b on Anyscale will give a very similar response to Llama-7b on Together?
[2024-02-27, 13:04:10] Rohit Aggarwal: yes, it should. The underlying model is the same but we’ve observed minor differences at times. Although everyone claims to have the same non-quantized model behind the API
[2024-02-27, 13:04:18] Nirant K: Yes, that is the expectation. There might be some quantization on their inferencing as well — which can lead to minor differences. I've not compared hosting providers, so hard to say
[2024-02-27, 13:05:06] Nirant K: What amount do you need? Can do in personal capacity and ask friends too if it's small enough
[2024-02-27, 13:51:40] Arko C | xylem.ai: That’s cause the LLM config is not the same for most. One of our customers has seen a lot more difference for structured data use cases (sql queries n all)
[2024-02-27, 13:53:03] Arko C | xylem.ai: Everyone claims to have fp16, so can’t comment on whether they degrade the model or anything. Cause for something like fp8, you barely see a performance drop in general. Hard to notice. But these will be nothing but conspiracy theories.

[2024-02-27, 23:45:21] Soham (Composio.dev): Hey Folks, So was having a good debate with a friend and would love everyones point of view.

In the near future, do you expect many Agentic companies like Lindy.ai or Lutra.ai solving for AI based agentic automation? Or you would expect it to be more concentrated and copilots from large companies like microsoft or google will win over the market and it will resemble an oligopoly.
[2024-02-27, 23:58:25] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I have a feeling, Google and Microsoft might offer services like Lindy AI or Lutra AI eventually but not in the next 3 years atleast, but at the end, there will still be a need for the following:
1. Edge cases: Do either of them support loops? Creating agents that call an agent calling API? If not why not ? What happens when we want to start a swarm of agents for a task of the same type ? With automated views on whats the correct stopping condition? 
2. This will just give rise to a new form of agentic prompting rather than LLM prompting, so there will be a new market in general

[2024-02-28, 08:05:33] Nirant K: Beware of DSPy, it can add 10-15x more API calls making your system more expensive and slow
[2024-02-28, 08:44:28] Shan: Yes even in their paper they say that automatically optimizing the prompts using teleprompter causes a lot of calls. I think it’s useful for hosted LLMs but otherwise you’ll end up making OpenAI or msft investors richer

The skill sets of musical instrument designers overlaps significantly with consumer audio devices, so it’s worth combing that space for independent designers.

Is it an audio/speech design you’re looking at ?

If an ai agent offers better quality & lower TCO, but effectively puts a human agent out of work, what should companies/govts choose ?

https://x.com/acgt01/status/1762770612852777199?s=20
[2024-02-28, 15:00:57] Amit Bhor: I meant the claims and not the implications
[2024-02-28, 15:16:03] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: can potentially impact(increase ?) customer satisfaction and hence drive savings for enterprises

Maybe for now, enterprises will offer both - status quo human call centre + ai driven support agent, and see the uptake of the ai agents , before deploying widely

i think depends on enterprises’s target customer strata - some older customers really want to hear a human at the other end
younger consumers may be more willing to talk to a ai support agent (lower wait time, talk 24/7, more empathetic ?) 

but its not clear from the klarna example, can these ai agents take actions in the real world - waive off a charge, reschedule something, cancel a contract, or do they simply provide information ( Do the following steps to cancel a contract)

The former, will cause more value addition, but would also require enterprises to tweak/adapt their daily workflows, to be acted upon by agents (allow autonomous cancelling of contracts, waiving off a charge)

Just a small anecdote - when you cancel a swiggy order, (delayed beyond a time threshold) - it offers automatic refund via a chatbot, which i think is the smart “ai”( admittedly rules based) way to reduce support workload and increase customer satisfaction

Finally, chatbots can scale up/down much more elastically than a typical contract with a contact centre solution.

Maybe companies like observe.ai(yc funded) are already building similar agents
https://www.ycombinator.com/companies/observe-ai
[2024-02-28, 15:33:48] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Bang on target, this is precisely what a lot of enterprises navigate through usually. Airtel thanks app bot for customer support also went through similar iterations. Some of the requests are routed to human agents. While around 75% channel specific requests are handled using AI.

There are also different modalities which users use. Some also request support in different languages such as Hindi and also use speech rather than click and type and there are also mixed code queries. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-02-28, 17:29:14] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Even without AI agents ,chatbots based on NLP/NLU had the ability to take actions like cancel order,refund money etc.We can ask Haptik,Yellow team members in group :) 


Taking the example of Swiggy where you get automatic refund

Klarna has surfaced similar functionality in their support bot.
Like based on user Q/A tree bot will show buttons like Extend Payment Plan,Request Refund etc 

The core insight driving this is that it’s easier and cheaper to provide a refund than to get a human to answer query ,make judgement and then provide refund

You add some rule engine for eligibility and instead of getting a human you directly get refund for your order

Klarna seems to have added such product and UX changes in addition to AI support bot.

It’s less about automation taking jobs and more efficient flows making need for support irrelevant.

[2024-02-28, 19:39:42] Nirant K: ColBERT is multi-vec — you can't use it in any setting where you care about speed, cost or similar. Maybe as a reranker, but that's also slow for anything more than few sentences per document. Not to mention — you'll have to maintain and deploy their PLAID indexing, which is a mess of it's own
[2024-02-28, 19:41:52] ~ Ganaraj: I believe ColBertV2 is fast ? Is it good as a reranker ?

Has anyone looked out for potential solutions on a similar situation? One is to use multi processing and run multiple commands and ofc this needs tons of memory. Faster versions of Whisper don't seem to support multilingual which is important for me. 🙏 ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-28, 20:11:16] ~ Ganaraj: Like I said, I have tried bge-m3 and bge-large on a GPU machine too. It took like 3s+ for 100 documents.. which is not good as a post ecommerce search reranker.. May work for RAG apps I guess..
[2024-02-28, 20:11:46] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: May be we all can collab on DSPY best practices what works and what doesn't work .. I think it is still an evolving framework as we look at it.

[2024-02-28, 20:30:23] Nirant K: Re rankers are cross encoders, embedding models are encoders only. That's a world of difference. Like using a knife vs spoon to cut a coconut. One of them is going to be faster
[2024-02-28, 20:34:42] Kartik Mandaville: yes that shows up in the cost of cohere rerank vs gpt4. We are currently facing issues with json structure with cohere so exploring bge
[2024-02-28, 20:35:47] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: If by multi-lingual you mean European, a lot of them should be better than Indian multi-lingual in few models.

In fact I wrote about this in a comment on the HN discussion of this topic.

We have been experimenting with the paper(https://www.researchgate.net/publication/372834606_ON_NON-IT...).
There is a mathematical proof that binary representation is enough to capture the latent space. And in fact we don't even need to do "training" to get that representation.

The practical application we tried out for this algorithm was to create an alternate space for mpnet embeddings of Wikipedia paragraphs. Using Bit embedding we are able to represent 36 million passages of Wikipedia in 2GB.(https://gpt3experiments.substack.com/p/building-a-vector-dat...)

370k hours of audio data in 140 languages. Will greatly benefit TTS/ASR as more work comes out in open source.

Jumping on this. Will share learnings.
[2024-02-29, 11:26:51] Nirant K: cc @919915123897
[2024-02-29, 12:39:15] Lucifer 😎: morning people. 

is there any quantitative measure to check *how many extracted samples* needs to be passed to any reranker to perform best ?

Right now - i've kept a score threshold as 0.7 - but I still get ~ 20 docs
Passing all 20 docs makes sense ? Or should I increase the threshold to 0.8 and get only 10 docs to be passed into reranker. 

Using Cohere vanilla reranker.
[2024-02-29, 12:43:18] Nirant K: Step 1: Stop thinking in terms of thresholds and use a metric which aligns your end usage e.g. F1@1 if you're doing classification, Recall@10 for RecSys, or nDCG@10 if you're doing search
[2024-02-29, 12:45:14] Lucifer 😎: the issue being, the dataset / docs which I have are not labelled and the count is upto 300k

Hence, how can I use those metrics If I don't have labels to those ?
[2024-02-29, 12:47:12] Nirant K: Manually write 10 queries and it's best match from your 300K. Start with that, augment with LLMs as needed. If you can't hand write 10 queries, you've deeper problems to solve.
[2024-02-29, 12:48:01] Lucifer 😎: Got it. 
Will take time to make such an arrangement today

Thanks.
[2024-02-29, 12:48:42] Nirant K: F1@1, Recall@10 don't need anything except 1 query and 1 answer which should most likely be the best. I'd even go to the extent of writing the best possible answer myself or asking the domain expert, Product Manager, my CEO to write answers manually for me and then stuff that into the search corpus. 
[2024-02-29, 12:49:34] Nirant K: This exercise takes about 2-4 hours and if you tell them "I'm writing tests to give you confidence goodness of this system" — they'd usually oblige, assuming they care about goodness
[2024-02-29, 12:50:53] Lucifer 😎: Got it. Makes sense. 
We do have in-house annotation team. Maybe I can pull one of them and make them understand about this

The PM is supportive in this project, will take good use of it.
[2024-02-29, 12:52:51] Nirant K: I personally don't like outsourcing this to annotation team — I'd rather give them the samples which I've curated and vetted to write more. It's unfair to expect them to do a good job in a zero shot setting. Only GPT4 can do that ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-29, 12:53:58] Nirant K: Case study: Almost all errors in ImageNet stem from edge cases not covered in annotation guidelines OR not following them — but either way, they had good annotation guidelines for the time
[2024-02-29, 12:54:23] Lucifer 😎: Hmm, I'll have a small conversation w/ my head on this. 

your inputs are valuable. considered it. Thanks
[2024-02-29, 12:56:25] Nirant K: Another trick: You can model a ranking problem as a classifier problem for which you can get use your few shot samples. That way you get a lot of high-quality in-domain Recall data, if not nDCG or Precision at least. And you can iterate on the classifier as well, so you can iteratively scale to roughly 10-40% of your entire dataset. 

I've scaled this trick to a few million using a light weight fasttext k-way classifier on a M2 Mac. 
[2024-02-29, 13:17:53] Atik Shaikh: Speaking of copilot there’s this pplx like search engine targeting programmers. They rebranded copilot as ‘agent mode’

Yes - he might have removed gfg from the index

But nonetheless, initiatives are supported
[2024-02-29, 15:22:07] ~ Ajay: Anyone's who has explored Retell AI ( for TTS ), what does Retell do that Eleven Labs doesn't do or doesn't do well? Looks like Eleven Labs also supports Websockets ( as well as just audio streaming ) and I don't see what Retell is doing that gets their latency down every more or make it more natural that Eleven Labs can't. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-29, 15:30:33] Sachit Sharma: Retell AI is not a alternative for TTS, they are E2E voice agents platform.
They use Eleven Labs for TTS
[2024-02-29, 15:40:51] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Mostly self hosted TTS and STT for latency. We have been doing E2E voice for a year now. Can be easy to execute for English, tough for Indic.
[2024-02-29, 15:41:06] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Then also latency vs Cost of self hosting models
[2024-02-29, 15:42:10] ~ Ajay: So you're saying the Audio websocket they have abstracts away the end to build your own? Because the LLM websocket resembles Eleven Labs websocket option. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-29, 15:43:47] ~ Ajay: Sorry not sure what this is in respond to. Is it to my question or to Sachit's response? ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-29, 15:47:28] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: What I think, they may be doing
[2024-02-29, 15:52:49] Ruthvik Reddy: They offer this interruption detection feature, some helper code for twilio integration and APIs for call and transcript logs. Not sure if eleven labs provides all of this out of the box. The way I see it, they abstract away good amount of complexity involved in building voice agents. And, their roadmap seems promising. (Agent specific vocab is one main feature that I'm interested in)
[2024-02-29, 16:02:03] ~ Ajay: This makes sense
[2024-02-29, 16:02:39] ~ Ajay: I'm sure this has been spoken about - but to put together a demo on an end to end workflow but for an Indian language - do you have any recommendations? ( Retell works only for English today )
[2024-02-29, 16:02:45] ~ Ajay: Say just Hindi for now
[2024-02-29, 16:07:01] ~ Ajay: Also another question - SOTA LLMs today are still in English, which means if I want to respond in Hindi, do I convert the audio to English text, then use say GPT-4 and then convert back to Hindi text and then to Hindi speech?
[2024-02-29, 16:07:22] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: We are avoiding socket based streaming E2E as it becomes easy to break guardrails. Indic languages will need a layer of translation or you can use self-hosted fine tune OpenHathi to remove that component, something we are planning to do with Dhenu.
[2024-02-29, 16:10:59] ~ prasanna kumar: may i know what are the other methods to stream audios ?
[2024-02-29, 16:11:25] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Whisper support streaming
[2024-02-29, 16:11:39] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Whisper small can be very quick if hosted on GPU
[2024-02-29, 16:12:08] ~ Ajay: That means that we'll need to handle the following

1) Connect to the Twilio or equivalent frontend to get the user's voice note

2) Convert it to text - say hindi ( using one of Open AI's STT models? )

3) Send this to OpenHathi or convert this text to English and send to gpt-4

4) Convert the response back to Hindi if it's an English response. Else send the Hindi text to the TTS engine

5) Send the generate speech to the Twilio frontend
[2024-02-29, 16:13:19] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: No. Get Hindi text from Whisper, use openhathi to answer in Hindi then use TTS.
[2024-02-29, 16:14:19] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Why are you using Twilio? It’s 2024.
[2024-02-29, 16:17:49] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: If your goal is to match retell in Hindi, use selfhosted whisper, OpenAI api May have latency. You should be doing everything end2end on a single GPU machine. Even hosting your LLM. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-29, 16:21:35] ~ prasanna kumar: twilio  might be required to initiate calls ?
correct me if i am wrong ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-02-29, 16:22:24] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: For a phone call based system, yes.
[2024-02-29, 16:23:29] ~ prasanna kumar: if i want to remove delay from there , what can i do to remove it or is there any other good alternative for twilio
[2024-02-29, 16:23:38] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Once connection is established, Twilio is not part of the latency.
[2024-02-29, 16:25:48] ~ prasanna kumar: web socket connection right ?
[2024-02-29, 16:32:14] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Twillio or any other voice provider using websocket is near realtime.

[2024-03-01, 03:09:13] Prakash Sankar Harbor: in AI, they aren't acquiring (likely because they aren't sure of PMF, it's less clear), and on top of that they are basically funding research

[2024-03-01, 10:22:50] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: So everyone else is having difficulties finetuning gemma on Twitter (Tek, Yam) and we already have two models from the group. Looks like, we are not just playing catch up game anymore. 👏 ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-01, 10:23:16] Rahul Deora: Anyone know a good open-source model/workflow for speaker   diarization and transcription? Mostly focused on Hindi.
[2024-03-01, 10:30:50] ~ Sagar: diarization is generally language agnostic. depends on speaker variations in the data. For hindi transcription, there is nemo, IITM and others also on huggingface.
[2024-03-01, 10:31:30] ~ Sagar: Why are you using diarization? generally its recommended to stay from it if you could determine speakers using other techniques.
[2024-03-01, 10:47:26] Priyank Agrawal: Looking for good prompts to classify a user input text into NSFW, threat and others buckets. Any leads or whenever should I look?

Context - want to prevent user from entering NSFW,  security related content before we send their input content to others on the platform.
[2024-03-01, 10:57:10] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Diarization is one place where humans still beat AI. 😅Might change with Gemini 1.5 Pro though. You can maybe feed in a sloppy one and ask it to fix it based on the audio/video provided.
[2024-03-01, 11:00:16] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: whisper.cpp supports diarization, I have used it before. Got to test for Hindi, though.
[2024-03-01, 11:01:53] Rahul Deora: Can have one or multiple speakers and want to separate them

[2024-03-01, 11:46:52] Shan: Hi guys - I repeatedly get asked by PM type folks looking for general LLM gyan which they can apply to their industry or just look good in front of their seniors etc. What’s a good YouTube channel or podcast etc which is fairly non technical which I can recommend. This has happened quite a few times and I generally give an answer which is too geeky and not helpful
[2024-03-01, 11:47:13] Shan: (I tried asking this to gpt and Gemini and didn’t get good answers)
[2024-03-01, 11:51:16] ~ Harsha: Lol. You can start with Andrej Karpathy’s walkthroughs on LLMs and Tokenization first and then dive deeper into whatever you don’t understand maybe
[2024-03-01, 11:52:22] Shan: Hmmm no. These are people in like “finance backend” and so on yaar. They don’t care about tokens. 😔
[2024-03-01, 11:52:59] Shan: They would likely love automation etc type stuff. More “applied ai”

How can someone transitioning from the pre-ChatGPT era, who's familiar with traditional models like BERT and T5 for tasks such as classification, NER, and summarization, adapt to the era of LLMs? 

With constant advancements like RLFH in ChatGPT, RAG, quantization, developments like DPO, MOE models, and emerging formats like GGUF GGML, etc.... how can one effectively catch up with the latest trends and technologies?

1. encoder 
2. decoder

How transformers help in text generation.

Then go through these:

1. https://huggingface.co/docs/transformers/en/llm_tutorial
2. deeplearning.ai courses - short ones first and long ones for depth
3. Stanford course materials
4. karpathy tokenization on youtube

Rahul here, I am an iOS dev.

I am building a ChatWithMedicalHistory + nutrition coach kind of app.

In the app, I will let the user upload a document and I want to use that doc as the KB + gpt-4-turbo, so incase someone asks if you can eat this particular food or not, it'll first go through your medical history and then using gpt-4 it'll decide whether you can eat it or not.

The problem I'm facing is idk any platforms where I can build such flow where every user can add their own data to the KB and I can integrate it within my app.

Kindly enlighten me.

[2024-03-03, 14:47:43] Dia Thanki: Hence, my earlier point! 
If the regulation means priority is given to big tech at the expense of smaller startups, this kills innovation and startups.

[2024-03-03, 15:35:39] Harveen Singh Chaddha: This samvaad is different than sarvam’s samvaad

I also got confused but its gpt-4 outputs mixed with samvaad from sarvam for training the model:

[2024-03-03, 15:47:05] ~ Satpal: They used word "Samvaad" before Sarvam for their models and they also hold trademark for it.
[2024-03-03, 15:53:20] Harveen Singh Chaddha: Ok my bad, I am not aware of trademark thing.
But again these datasets (https://huggingface.co/GenVRadmin) are different than sarvam’s dataset. On a side note, I have access to llamavaad and samvaad model. Will try to summarize in a while.

[2024-03-03, 18:02:18] Nirant K: OpenAI cookbook has quite a few
[2024-03-03, 19:10:44] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: LlamaIndex and LangChain repos are nothing but filled with RAG examples
[2024-03-03, 19:11:20] Samhan Meta/Twitter Friend: How much accuracy do they achieve. Is there anything with more than 90-95 % ? I’d like to study those
[2024-03-03, 19:19:55] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: LlamaIndex has multiple RAG strategies as examples 
The accuracy would be very high for the given examples but it’s very context specific imo

Same or similar implementation for different use case might have lower accuracy

Azure t2s seems robotic and while eleven labs is very good with American accents, it does badly on Indian accents/proper nouns.
[2024-03-04, 10:21:14] ~ Pathik Ghugare: So for MalayaLLM you pretrained the model along with the Tokenizer and then fine-tuned it on Alpaca as well

I assume you pretrained it since the existing Tokenizer is not performing well on the respective language but is there any other way where instead of pretraining the model we can incorporate new tokens?

It seems like a logical approach for tasks like fn calling, why arent there ever newer/popular papers on this anywhere from arxiv sanity or HF
[2024-03-05, 02:35:26] Arko C | xylem.ai: That’s exactly what we were discussing today. The way they crawl the internet and get the data, might just have some test data being scrapped that goes unnoticed, and contaminates the model.

Every other day there’s a new “SoTA” LLM outperforming GPT4, but we haven’t actually seen anything outperforming GPT4 unless it’s a domain-specific or context-specific fine-tuned model. Would wait for some teams need to use it in production and only when we get consistent feedback, cause idk how much of the benchmarks can anyone trust.

This is not to sh*t on any model or company. This is what should be followed for all LLMs at large, be it closed, open, pre-trained or fine-tuned. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-03-05, 14:25:49] Sachin Legaltech: The way I look at RAG is optimizing prompts.. we are adding more and more useful information for model to reason on. As we get millions of tokens in context length, we can have additional strategies to retrieve different documents and put them at different places in the prompt .. so RAG in the current form (simple fact based qa) might die; but the idea of retrieving relevant information and putting it in the prompt seems immortal.

🔥𝐍𝐚𝐯𝐚𝐫𝐚𝐬𝐚 is a Gemma 7B & 2B SFT model using Gemma 7B & 2B base models. Last week we released the Telugu Gemma 7B/ 2B SFT model using curated Telugu datasets from Telugu LLM Labs and we observed really good performance compared to Llama2-based models.

🌐 Scaled up Gemma 7B & 2B models to multiple Indian languages and we went ahead with testing tokenizers of the following 9 Indian Languages and English Language.

1. Hindi
2. Telugu
3. Tamil
4. Malayalam
5. Kannada
6. Gujarati
7. Bengali
8. Punjabi
9. Odia
10. English

Findings:
✨ Found the model to have the following capabilities: (X represents any other Indian language)

1. Instruction and Input in Native X language, Output in Native X language.

2. Instruction and Input in English language prompted to respond in Native X language, Output in Native X language.

3. Instruction in Native X language, Input in English language, and Output in Native X language.

Thanks to the collaborative efforts of all the individual language contributors who trained Llama 2 and Mistral based models and released instruction datasets in their native languages. This work wouldn't be possible without that :)

[2024-03-06, 11:07:38] Ramsri Goutham: We didn't include any romanized datasets in our fine-tuning so it wouldn't be suited for Hinglish. But whatever Hinglish the base model understands/trained on, might have some Hinglish instruction understanding capabilty to some extent.

https://speechbrain.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html - Supports very good evaluation methods (which can be finetuned too). Very rare to see good evaluation methods to compare generated vs original speech.

There are other models whose weights can be directly used but not going into that rabbit hole now. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-06, 18:35:03] Priyank Agrawal: There is a gap in the LLM market where an LLM is needed which is extremely good at instructions following and is ideally built keeping RAG in mind.

Only evals relevant to these should be benchmarked. No cot, No math accuracy, no coding and other bullshit evals.

Not everyone needs AGI, many developers just need the LLM to follow every word in the instructions.

Happy to pay for it and use it as an api (assuming a good/small model thus comparable pricing and latency).

Technically there will be some changes that will happen with any model you change from any provider.

What steps people take when changing models? Like evals? Or what?
[2024-03-07, 08:40:31] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: eval regression kind of suite is more of grey area right now for LLMs, I feel. Something using Ragas can be orchestrated as a eval + test suite kind of to check regression effects ?

[2024-03-07, 15:28:24] Gokul Krishnan: Others have chimed in already so here's my 2 Rappen
1. We don't know the RLHF and SFT datasets they used. No guarantee that these didn't have data that makes Claude "feel more human" , resulting in what we see
2. In the leaked system prompt, we see the pretraining data cutoff was Autumn 2023. This is well after ChatGPT and others captured the public imagination and very likely such "sentience like" data is present
3. More nefariously, keep in mind that Anthropic was one of the participants in  the white house on AI safety, they already have the ear of the regulators and this may be a part of regulatory capture

[2024-03-08, 02:54:23] Prakash Sankar Harbor: I had a theoretical question - suppose you had two sentences that semantically mean the exact same thing, but are expressed with different words. Does that mean their vector embeddings will be exactly the same (so even if the vectors themselves have different values, one vector would just be a scaled version of the other vector)?
[2024-03-08, 02:55:46] Prakash Sankar Harbor: or if that doesn't happen - that's just because representing semantic meaning in N Dimensional space will never be as accurate as it is when two human beings "represent the meaning" in their heads?

[2024-03-08, 03:08:08] Priyesh OnFinance: yeah but the main idea was that the retriever needs embeddings to be sparse so that top n is very high quality. and maybe generic embedders aren't sparse enough for every usecase
[2024-03-08, 03:08:46] Priyesh OnFinance: for example in financial services with horizontal models, you get ~40% false positive in top 10 retrieval for most usecases

[2024-03-08, 08:18:48] Nirant K: There's no two sentences with same meaning -- because all language exists in context. 

That said, yes -- we know that most embedding models are linear transforms of each other. In fact, you can train a decoder to get a rough text back from the embedding
[2024-03-08, 08:22:39] ~ prakashpvss: I tried using the Telugu Fine Tuned LLM from Hugging Face of Telugu LLM Labs shared earlier in the group.
While the examples in the github were awesome , I had a very different observations when I started using it.
Mainly
1. Model has catastrophic forgetting after Finetuning. It forgot the information from Base Models
2. It is very sensitive to Romanized versions of Telugu.
3. Lot of difference in responses between same queries written in native script vs Transliterated Versions.
Some examples pasted in the below doc

Thanks for testing it out. Yes, we did observe this. 

Also, the model is not trained for romanized scripts. 

The model is bad at answering questions for facts. 

Good at Question answering given a context.

[2024-03-08, 12:48:40] ~ Sourab Mangrulkar: Given that70B models requires:
1. Atleast 16 80GB GPUs (2 nodes with 8 GPUs each) for full finetuning 
2. with FSDP+LoRA, you would need 8 80GB GPUs.
3. with DDP+QLoRA, you still require a couple of 80GB GPUs.

Now, combining FSDP+QLoRA allows for quantized weights to be shared across GPU which reduces the GPU requirements when compared to DDP+QLoRA. So, going all the way from 16 80GB GPU to 2 24/40GB GPUs for finetuning 70B model makes it more accessible.

If I were to prompt I’d start off by prompting gpt “you are an expert at NER (named entity recognition) task”. (I dunno if it works in this case but on some other tasks we have found it to make a huge difference) These things do matter if you are claiming you’re better than LLMs

[2024-03-10, 11:06:16] ~ Nishkarsh | usefindr.com: curious- won’t different use cases involve some experimentation? eg - how would you know if contextual compression is better than using vector stores for your use case
[2024-03-10, 11:07:46] Jay Pokarna 2014 BPCC: Yeah, same question. Is sd3 out?
[2024-03-10, 11:10:24] Nirant K: Yes, that's why there is money in building tools to run ongoing benches which can integrate with testing and CI pipes even. I'd love it if Llama Index or RAGAS exposed this as a cloud API, but doesn't look like folks want to build this — given the persona is limited to power users e.g. metric driven system designers.

And power users aren't making buying decisions right now, it's the people who want "ChatGPT for my data" who form the bulk of buying decisions right now. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-03-10, 11:38:08] ~ prakashkagitha: I see a lot of work around ToT; adding better simulation of possible paths, value function estimation for different states, reflection on failed paths, and so on. There are a lot of techniques with some combinations of these features, a few: ReAct, ToT, RAP, and Reflexion. Language Agent Tree search (LATS; https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.04406) claims to unify many methods for reasoning, acting, and planning. That might just mean having mix of all components proposed so far :)

Having more components takes more calls/tokens and I never really found them practical for general use cases that I work on. Probably math reasoning or root cause analysis or some problem solving tasks might draw the best of these approaches. Nevertheless, Chain of thought/explanation for answers seem to help always, self-refine or one more call to validate also helps if we could afford, if we could have automated feedback from a tool (executing SQL/python), another call along with feedback helps and seem necessary to get correct answer … I am yet to find justification for more sophisticated and costly operations
[2024-03-10, 11:54:16] ~ Geetika Mehta: Well said. And totally agree with you on what you mentioned. I feel a balance would strike at some point where which framework works best for what would automatically take over.
[2024-03-10, 12:36:50] Shan: I agree in general. But the counterpoint is that GPT calls will only get cheaper and cheaper as we go along. There’s little doubt about that. So keep in mind that these are research papers not necessarily intending to solve practical questions of today (that is the domain of engineering, not of research). But these are not in some fantasy land. If a problem can be solved with 100 calls today it’s going to soon become practical for sure. Being ahead of the curve means being ready to utilise the power of GPT to the max. Cost is ultimately a solvable problem because the underlying hardware, technology and model efficiency are all being scaled up rapidly and effectively.
[2024-03-10, 12:43:57] ~ prakashkagitha: Valid points, I agree. I was mostly coming from pragmatic engineering prospective. Wanted to highlight that sometimes there are data format or problem formulation related changes that would improve results more than sophisticated research prompt engineering techniques. That said, I agree this is not a problem of research and soon they might even be practical.

[2024-03-12, 14:01:17] Arghya Bhattacharya Enterpet, Equal: Anyone here, who's worked on making open-source whisper model perform well on Speech to Text on their data? 

There's a huge gap b/w the performance from openAI whisper model and the open weights, would love to understand the low hanging fruits and what's the experiment-to-performance reward ratio for pre-process/fine-tuning/chunking strategies. 

would appreciate if anyone could share resources for the same.

[2024-03-12, 14:31:43] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: has anyone seen any work or paper around controlling GenAI data distribution ? lets say i want the output generated data in a gaussian distribution, etc. This is usually called normalizing flows (https://arxiv.org/abs/2211.16488), but unsure if this is something different in GenAI space.

Intuitively it feels it can be done - by controlling certain layers of the Transformers model....and it seems like a very basic usecase. But unable to find any research around it
[2024-03-12, 14:33:07] Abhishek Maiti: I may be wrong, but shouldn’t controlling data distribution constraints be agnostic of how the data is generated?

[2024-03-12, 14:50:53] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: i dont know. i dont have a strong opinion here - however if you have any code or research that shows how it can be done in LLMs, ill be grateful
[2024-03-12, 14:53:08] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: so im actually doing the exact opposite. edgechains has a webassembly runtime that compiles declarative prompts (in jsonnet) into wasm to make it loadable into javascript - server, device and edge. 

https://github.com/arakoodev/EdgeChains/actions/runs/8131776780

we also ship the wasm to the server directly, so deployment is easier. still alpha...so be kind :D
[2024-03-12, 14:54:32] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: So cool. Opposite in what way? Didn't get that

[2024-03-12, 14:57:49] ~ Akash Singh: I tried wasemdge based llamacpp deployment it fast and have abuild dependencies of 30mb. This one should be good to with llamacpp backend as candle transformers is still not mature like ggml.
[2024-03-12, 14:58:49] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: aici unifies everything at wasm level - allows you to write code in python and maintain everything in wasm.
we also run everything in wasm (our runtime is based on javy and wasmtime), but im being kind of a javascript maximalist here - the idea of wasm being  to allow javascript to shine. 
so for example, i try to load llama.cpp into wasm to allow it to execute in a JS runtime.
[2024-03-12, 14:58:53] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: sort of the opposite way
[2024-03-12, 15:00:30] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Appreciate the response. Clearly bit out of my area of expertise. Have to understand this better on my end. Thanks though 🙏
[2024-03-12, 15:01:24] ~ Akash Singh: This is wasm based llm deployment for serverless. I have tried it on mac, nvidia-a6000 and raspberry pi. Only model weights are bigger rest binaries are just 30mb. 

https://github.com/LlamaEdge/LlamaEdge
[2024-03-12, 15:01:51] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: put simply - u write javascript and engineer your prompts in jsonnet *declaratively* and it ships and runs everywhere. especially on the edge.
kind of like vercel or cloudflare functions. we run it on a knative based kubernetes edge ourselves.
[2024-03-12, 15:02:28] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I see. Interesting
[2024-03-12, 15:02:43] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: yup. in rust. 
the reason we built a compiler and runtime for wasm is cos we are a bit of a javscript maximalist. (ill duck for cover now)
[2024-03-12, 15:04:26] ~ Akash Singh: I just started exploring working on edge devices and wasmedge is like super effective. Python libraries were not working well but low level libraries like ggml and rust based are loading and giving good inference.
[2024-03-12, 15:06:11] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: really like wasmedge. 
not production ready however. very kubernetes unfriendly. we run wasmtime on knative and k8s. chatted with the fastly guys too...they are the one upstreaming wasmtime and wasmedge.

one day wasmedge will get there.
[2024-03-12, 15:07:46] ~ Akash Singh: Yes i just started exploring on side also if we have batch queries then it might be good like service up for sometime and then stopped like a cron job .

About 7000+ folks have a title called 'prompt engineer' on LinkedIn. Most of them come from peripheral functions like UI/UX designing, Content Writing, etc. (as expected). 

Having said that - have written prompts (won't call myself a prompt engineer), experimented with them a lot, can help you with your queries.
[2024-03-13, 08:35:47] ~ Pathik Ghugare: While experimenting or researching on GenAI or LLMs on your usecases do you guys follow any framework to compare or make the decisions?

I've tried breaking down the problem into 3 parts and approach the same but it's really hard 
My usecase is based of doing structured data extraction from policy documents (output is JSON with 3 levels of nesting at policy claims and loss levels) so I worked on few things
- Prompting : How to feed PDF or OCR text  into these models
- ⁠Model
- ⁠Evaluation: Forming our own custom metrics as per the usecase which may include costs as well

Based on these things we can compare different models and decide which ones to go far 

Do you think this is enough?
Please suggest what you guys follow or what is missing apart from these things ?

[2024-03-13, 17:58:31] ~ Shree: There is a hackerhouse in HSR
And I guess the residency is trying to open a chapter in Bangalore too
[2024-03-13, 18:12:23] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: What I am looking is suggesting  potential search terms and not results, way Google autocomplete works. It's almost like gpt - predict the next word user is likely to search for
[2024-03-13, 18:25:42] ~ Prajwal Apple: @917769926360 this is the same hackerhouse which you have sent.

[2024-03-13, 19:08:58] Shan: Actually I was about the same view but now I have changed. Someone who can work with langchain or other packages, someone who can build agents and make those work, someone who can optimize prompts using packages like dspy, someone who can do version control, rapid iteration and deployments of prompt and someone who understands the nuances of LLMs (eg prompts for one LLM vs another, esp small vs large), someone who can keep up with all new methods and surveys … well there are actually valuable skills. 

But more and more, I have now come to realise that we will live in a world where all code is generated using prompts. Ergo if someone who codes is an engineer, then someone who prompts in order to generate code is also an engineer. 🙃
[2024-03-13, 19:57:09] ~ Ashwin: Coder and engineer will separate in meaning again. It's a sinusoid

[2024-03-15, 09:38:18] Dia Thanki: Can anyone recommend any summarisation APIs (not LLMs) that work really well abstractively?
[2024-03-15, 09:38:35] Bharat Kumar Ramesh Hashmal Web3: Swagger is fairly reliable as long as you're using openapi 3.x
[2024-03-15, 09:38:37] Bharat Kumar Ramesh Hashmal Web3: If you're working in an express environment, I've found this package (tsoa) to be very clean and elegant
[2024-03-15, 09:40:13] Chetanya Rastogi: At this point I would except any and every API would be using an LLM behind the scenes. What's your use case that you strictly don't want an LLM behind the API?
[2024-03-15, 09:45:46] Dia Thanki: Client will not allow us to use open ai
[2024-03-15, 09:46:07] Dia Thanki: They are not production ready and too expensive

[2024-03-15, 09:51:03] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: https://arxiv.org/abs/2403.06350

we train a 5-gram Kneser-Ney model using the KenLM (Heafield, 2011) library.

They did this to calculate the perplexity in the sangraha unverified corpus... Any reasons they did that? Why not a BERT based model?
[2024-03-15, 10:01:08] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Extremely costly right, to run bert over a pretraining base.
[2024-03-15, 10:02:34] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Yeah I figured. Makes sense thanks
[2024-03-15, 11:42:18] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: https://openai.com/customer-stories/healthify interesting to see Indian company case-study being featured by open ai

[2024-03-15, 12:22:28] ~ Ajay Yadav: Has anyone tried crewAI or Autogen? What was your use-case? Did you face see any limitations?
[2024-03-15, 12:22:40] ~ Ajay Yadav: Also: has anyone integrated crewAI with llamaindex? Thanks in advance 🙂
[2024-03-15, 12:27:17] Vamshi: ArXiv link via this HN comment:

“When the Softmax head is the transpose of the embedding matrix, the proposed method enables extraction of the entire matrix of pretrained token embeddings from a black-box model at a shockingly low cost.”

[2024-03-15, 14:11:03] Dia Thanki: No LLM can solve this easily
[2024-03-15, 14:11:58] Dr. Ashith Generative AI WA Group: microsoft copilot does it pretty well
[2024-03-15, 14:14:23] Rahul Deora: How to make it better tho?
[2024-03-15, 14:14:30] Rahul Deora: Using openai api
[2024-03-15, 14:15:57] Dr. Ashith Generative AI WA Group: yes but also the vision models...in one of chats it was able to refer to specific texts in my presentation
[2024-03-15, 14:16:38] Rahul Deora: Am sticking with LLMs only for now
[2024-03-15, 14:17:28] Dia Thanki: I've been searching for months and using an LLM, even a good one, it hallucinates so you have to finetune a lot and then incur the cost of computations. I just don't think it's production ready. 

If you use MS Co-Pilot, the data will go to Open AI so if you care about privacy, you'll need alternatives. 

I've heard Claude is the best one so far compared to Open AI but it's expensive and will require engineering effort ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-03-15, 16:36:39] Vamshi: Love this, I learnt a lot from the short line in sutskevers now famous talk, where he gives an intuitive explanation for the levels of abstraction learnt by a transformer at each layer (“starting from dictionaries that map simple words to simple phrases, all the way up to dictionaries that map large encyclopaedic definitions to words that don’t even exist in the language”).

This seems to point to a way to extract those dictionaries in a usable way.

[2024-03-15, 17:02:33] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Fair point:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2310.06816

*Have to look into details to see if it's same network or not* 

From a rough glance, it seems they are training something known as adapter layers. 


As an afterthought,
this does seem more a move in the right direction towards interpretability rather than pure magic.

[2024-03-15, 20:35:45] Nirant K: T5 isn't a LLM as such — I mean, you can always fall back to Cloud Providers with summarisation features? Cohere has one too, which isn't a LLM.

I am using both right now, but ChatGPT's ability to edit prompt and the multi tree thingy is pretty simple
[2024-03-16, 00:34:07] Azhan Mohammed Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Recently came across a weird problem. Had some data as jsons that I wanted to run reasoning on, GPT models were either too lazy or would straight up hallucinate to fit the query, while Claude 2.1 (shifted to haiku recently) don’t.
[2024-03-16, 00:34:24] Atik Shaikh: If I get the right answer at the first shot why would I feel to edit my original prompts ? Even if I do need a variation of original prompt I can start a new chat

For example I have data regarding 2 companies, 100 page doc for each. Now when I am asking a question, how to make sure if my retriever would pick the chunk for data of company one and vice versa.

( in short how to implement and instruct rag over multiple clusters)
[2024-03-16, 01:11:14] Ravi Theja: Have you looked into router query engine concept - https://docs.llamaindex.ai/en/stable/examples/query_engine/RouterQueryEngine.html ?
[2024-03-16, 01:11:18] Azhan Mohammed Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Is there a way you can figure out if a query is about company 1 or company 2?
[2024-03-16, 01:12:03] ~ Sparsh Jain: I can have these using metadata. However how to pass that info to the retriever or maybe how should I exactly store info.
[2024-03-16, 01:12:33] Azhan Mohammed Generative AI WhatsApp Group: In metadata add company name, when querying put a filter
[2024-03-16, 01:13:11] Azhan Mohammed Generative AI WhatsApp Group: So you’ll only retrieve documents from relevant company, apply reranker if necessary (RankGPT works really good over here)
[2024-03-16, 01:13:53] ~ Sparsh Jain: Put a filter where - I am not clear about this ?

[2024-03-16, 09:08:27] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: We did add SimOrca general purpose dataset in training of Dhenu after @919616406460 and Teknium suggested it. This paper goes a little further but in the same direction. 

The point is, indie hackers are discovering early and more about  LLMs by rapid experimentation than GPU-rich research labs. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-16, 09:11:17] Shan: True. LLMs are platforms and should be treated as such. App developers have pushed iOS applications to a level apple couldn’t ever have done by itself. In my mind, the apps of today are “agents”
[2024-03-16, 09:13:11] Sourasis Roy: Thanks for that deep insight. Will be great if you could share a bit about the infra used and what kind of time it took to train

[2024-03-16, 19:58:50] Ravi Theja: https://huggingface.co/datasets/adi-kmt/gooftagoo - @918867705880 has created a multi-turn hindi/hinglish dataset containing about 16k conversations mimicing real-life situations. Worth checking if anyone is working on finetuning for indic llms.
[2024-03-16, 20:04:22] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: This is a cool initiative as many Indic translations and datasets are too formal and don’t work well in real-world conversational scenarios. My 2 cents would be that someone contributes further with more gender-diverse interactions.
[2024-03-16, 20:05:43] Ravi Theja: Absolutely. @918867705880 would be great if you could share details on dataset creation for wider community.
[2024-03-16, 20:06:35] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: The current IndicTrans2, GCP and Azure translation models use such heavy Hindi that it would be easy for most to understand simple English words. 😁
[2024-03-16, 20:07:03] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: I think different emotions, characters, etc would be nice
[2024-03-16, 20:07:35] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: @919550164716 @918867705880 Start an indic conversational dataset working group
[2024-03-16, 20:08:11] ~ Ansha: Can you please add me too
[2024-03-16, 20:09:15] Ravi Theja: I mean which LLM did you use? cost incurred? any other parameters one should take care about when going for dataset creation with LLMs?
[2024-03-16, 20:12:45] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: Topics and characters generated using gemini, conversation generated using gpt 4
[2024-03-16, 20:13:01] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: Ideally everything in gpt4, but it would be too expensive
[2024-03-16, 20:13:25] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: Params to take care of, obviously temp, top_p
[2024-03-16, 20:13:39] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: That you have to have a look at different examples only
[2024-03-16, 20:14:24] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: We conquered fine tuning frontier, time for the Indie synthetic data front.
[2024-03-16, 20:39:15] ~ prasanna kumar: add mee too
[2024-03-16, 21:03:56] Harveen Singh Chaddha: So I generated a similar dataset recently:

Interaction is started by Mixtral. You have to provide system instructions to talk on a random topic in Indian context like politics in india, Himalayas, taj mahal, food etc. It took certain prompts to make it human like misspellings, wrong grammar, informal language etc.

The answer is generated by GPT-4. After capturing the GPT-4 response, the same is sent to Mistral to generate follow up questions creating a question pool. Then, questions are randomly sampled from question pool + fixed pool where fixed pool contains prompts like : "Mujhe samajh nai aaya, hindi mein batao", "Explain me like I am 5 years old" etc. 

The response from mistral is then again fed to GPT-4 with the entire previous conversation as context and response of GPT-4 is captured and so on until depth of 6-7.

This way I am generating a multi-turn dataset plus reading comprehension with question answering dataset.
[2024-03-16, 21:05:21] Ravi Theja: Is this only for Hindi language or you did it for punjabi as well?
[2024-03-16, 21:09:33] Harveen Singh Chaddha: Hindi individually, Punjabi individually, hindi and Punjabi mixing, but realized understanding of Punjabi for both models is not upto the mark, neither transliteration quality. 

In the entire process the biggest challenge was to make mixtral behave like a human. For ex: talk rudely, misplings like this, typing in shrt frm, codemixed language typing etc
[2024-03-16, 21:11:02] Ravi Theja: Okay if I understand correctly you made one LLM generate and another LLM correct or?
[2024-03-16, 21:11:07] Ravi Theja: *it
[2024-03-16, 21:12:04] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Outside of Hindi, it's a challenge and then these models start forgetting difference between Hindi Punjabi Gujarati at some point, and start mixing things up
[2024-03-16, 21:13:03] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: And if we rely on the translation model, they sound like Hindi subject teacher
[2024-03-16, 21:15:40] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Can YouTube videos be a good source for conversation?
[2024-03-16, 21:37:51] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: any links, can i have a look at your dataset?
[2024-03-16, 21:41:27] Sparsh Chutiya Agarwal Nova GenZ: for hinglish, GPT-4 worked really well but its costly
[2024-03-16, 21:43:31] Adithya GenAI WhatsApp Group: I think most sources like articles and textbooks, its very hard to get conversation like humans
I think we have to build something like

[2024-03-16, 21:47:48] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yes, it will, but those CCs are mostly translated into English. If once can find Hindi SRT, it can be jackpot as it may have conversations already.
[2024-03-16, 21:48:00] Aankit Roy Khabri YC: Anyone using assistant API of open AI or alternatives for similar use cases?
[2024-03-16, 21:48:46] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: +1, whisper has high WER for non English indic languages, but some guys have worked with meta seamless4t models, will find out and let you know how it does on non English STT data and also there are nvidia ASR models ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-03-17, 10:41:54] ~ Sid: currently i am sending multiple llm calls, in the 1st call I am determining the intent of customer (see plans, doubt, need convincing, buy plan etc), if it's see plans I am getting plan details and show it to customer, if it's doubt I answer it using RAG, one async llm call is for summarization of chat.

[2024-03-18, 10:42:27] ~ Sourab Mangrulkar: Hello, 
Given the super cool release of IndicLLMSuite, anyone here training and Indic model from scratch on the 250B tokens.

This might be a great experiment. One can look at the success of qwen and deepseek models to see how they use English+Chinese mixture and accordingly adjust for English+Indic pertaining data mixture. I think 8x1B MOE would have great performance and at the same time be lighting fast during inference.

We are evaluating reserving GPU capacity at a discount and offer it to companies that are at a stage they can pre-commit capacity and have it reserved for them. This is to help tackle both the cost and the lead time challenges with GPUs. If you will be interested to explore this pls fill up the form in the next few days (approx range ok but has to be directionally correct) and I will circle back when we have something:

[2024-03-18, 18:24:52] Kartik Mandaville: Has anyone been able to get GPT4 to respond in the same language as the query? What are some prompt engineering articles which I can read?

[2024-03-18, 18:25:58] Kartik Mandaville: like if the query is Spanish then reply in Spanish etc
[2024-03-18, 18:28:15] Paras Chopra Wingify: Try saying that your boss will cut your fingers if reply is in any language other than Spanish
[2024-03-18, 18:28:50] ~ Ravi: Q
[2024-03-18, 18:32:08] ~ Aj: Yes, if you ask a query in specific language then the response is also in same language as asked.
[2024-03-18, 18:34:08] ~ Amit Sharma: Yes, this works reasonably well (not too technically correct) for major EU languages.
[2024-03-18, 18:34:18] Kartik Mandaville: not to my experience.
[2024-03-18, 18:39:11] Ojasvi Yadav: It's necessarily not in a rag context where chunks are mostly in English
[2024-03-18, 18:42:20] Ravi Theja: In the testing we did Navarasa-2.0 model which we released replies in same language as query language even if context is in english. Probably, it also because of SFT finetuning we did. So, an SFT might help here.
[2024-03-18, 18:46:57] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Play with temperature + ask in to detect the language first. (Json mode)
[2024-03-18, 18:47:04] ~ Gaurav Chandak: For our usecases, we tried two approaches and both of them works reasonably well for us.
1. Specifically mention that "the response should be in the same language as the user prompt".
2. ⁠A two-step approach in which we ask GPT 3.5 to provide the language of the user prompt and then pass the same in the 2nd step. If you're returning structured JSON then you can ask GPT-4 to return the language of the prompt before the required response as part of a single call.
[2024-03-18, 19:04:13] ~ Aj: If it is for rag contex 

If directly instructing to llm from system prompt approach is not working 

You can try two step approach

You can say, always respond in English irrespective of user language 

And then send this response back to llm asking it to translate to target language and respond the translation in triple quotes
[2024-03-18, 19:06:18] Ramsri Goutham: The two-step approach has been most robust in my case. Few more inputs for more grounding:
1. Ask it to output the exact ISO language name.
2. Ask it to focus on the language of the main body of the text, irrespective of any localized names or places, etc.
Because quite often if the setting and names are in let's say Spanish speaking country although the story is in English, it can get misguided and output Spanish etc.
[2024-03-18, 19:34:04] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: If we are going to detect the language as a seperate step, wouldn’t langdetect be a better option?
[2024-03-18, 20:01:35] Ramsri Goutham: 1. I think langdetect covers maybe like 50-60 languages so not comprehensive. 
2. If you are in the LLM API ecosystem easier to do it within that and club it with other tasks. For example, I club Title generation and language identification task into one before the downstream task (question generation  in my case).
[2024-03-18, 20:09:40] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Yeah but much easier to do thresholding with langdetect plus if you are any out of the top 50 languages gpt3.5 is going to be terrible anyway
[2024-03-18, 20:12:49] ~ Sachin Kalsi: in case if you gonna use lang detect, you may try https://github.com/zafercavdar/fasttext-langdetect/ , which supports 170+ languages with a fair performance. This is the model being used in llama too

We had big issues using https://github.com/Mimino666/langdetect/
[2024-03-18, 20:13:23] ~ Sourab Mangrulkar: I use `twinny` for my daily use. https://github.com/rjmacarthy/twinny. This is completely free. Here is my tweet thread explaining my setup and the models used: https://twitter.com/sourab_m/status/1764583139798823235?t=H8Ys7ggqOnwkz1MUCxEpMw&s=19

Cody by Sourcegraph is good too but it costs $9 above 500 calls. 

Other alternatives are Tabby, Continue and Llama Coder.

[2024-03-18, 21:50:58] Hemant Mohapatra: Sorry what's the "decision" you are referring to? I was part of the team that acquired ATI assuming CUDA will be the closed proprietary platform on a niche HW vs openGL/CL. Turns out, if you play the closed loop hw+sw strategy for two decades AND get lucky a few times, you are unbeatable. That strategy has very high mortality rate, but those who survive have moats that took years to build and can't be build with capital alone.. Today you'll be shocked how much of sw has an "if cuda, then (), else ()" hard-coded into it at software, middleware and maybe even at kernel level. You can't unpack all that away in a year or ten.

[2024-03-18, 22:48:08] Hemant Mohapatra: ah ok -- well, lawsuit is a likely reason but I think the reason zluda is faster on AMD is because stuff has been so optimized for CUDA by now that a wrapper on HIP still runs faster on native AMD :) It kind of tells you how much ahead nvidia is today that their transpiled code runs faster on a different GPU than natively compiled code for that GPU. AMD just needs to improve its own developer tools/SDKs vs wasting time on projects that run hacked up code on it. Not a long term winning strategy

I have experience with Megatron-LM but I think if one is aiming for 8x1B MOE, I feel FSDP should be enough and quite convenient to work with.

[2024-03-19, 08:07:19] C Chaitanya: Is there interest in binary embeddings?
Exactly one year back we experimented and found that binary embeddings are enough.
We even converted mpnet embeddings to binary and put on leaderboard
https://huggingface.co/ManiShankar-AlpesAi/paraphrase-multilingual-mpnet-base-v2-KE_Sieve
For any embeddings we can find an alternative binary space. 
You think an API is useful?
[2024-03-19, 08:38:00] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: This looks crazy fast. But i wasn't able to understand much about how are they achieving this - apart from adding a super fast compiler to parse the schema and validate the generated output. @917977314565 did you understand it?
[2024-03-19, 09:47:09] Vetrivel PS: Did anyone tried prompt chaining for a sql generation? Considering the metadata of a table exceed max token limit
[2024-03-19, 10:13:43] Shivendu Kumar: I think if it overflows then you can try adding vector search over the fields (with their description and type) to only find the relevant ones for the current query. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-19, 10:18:15] Sumod K Mohan: So they can get 100% accurate structure, 100x faster, 10x lower latency but with slightly better than chatGPT3.5 accuracy on tasks. Seems light of what they do and couldn't see thebactualbtasks they compared. Guessing the model is much more constrained in reasoning and other capabilities than what their numbers might indicate. But interesting nonetheless. Smaller, faster models that can work reliably would definitely be interesting.

[2024-03-19, 10:28:04] Paras Chopra Wingify: Even that requires compute, assuming it’s happening dynamically at run time
[2024-03-19, 10:28:44] Sumod K Mohan: No, I am guessing they learn that when you define the grammar.
[2024-03-19, 10:31:14] Sumod K Mohan: There is this notion that if you just take transformer layer hooked up to each other, then it sort of acts as follows. There is residual stream of information, on which various layers act. Each layer can be thought of transforming the subspace of this residual stream, that is a small part or large part (local or global) of the space in a way. This is sort of saying for json, I know only few of those transformations matter. Since the grammar is predefined you can sort of learn what is important. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-19, 10:34:28] Paras Chopra Wingify: Oh, so it’s amortised over several runs

That’s clever
[2024-03-19, 10:34:59] Paras Chopra Wingify: But since you can’t have free lunch, I’m assuming it works well for a subset of cases like extraction but can’t be general purpose
[2024-03-19, 10:35:06] Sumod K Mohan: Potentially amortized over all uses of json.
[2024-03-19, 10:35:48] Sumod K Mohan: Yup. This with superposition issues might cause more problems. Don't know how they handled that.
[2024-03-19, 10:35:50] Paras Chopra Wingify: Yes several runs of the same structure
[2024-03-19, 10:37:33] ~ Tarun🐍👨‍💻: Just curious, is there any major difference between SFT vs Full fine tuning. 

What I understand is that they both are esentially the same, but in SFT we target only few parameters of the model, while in full finetuning we target all the model's trainable parameters.

Please correct me if I am wrong. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-19, 10:40:18] Sumod K Mohan: TLDR on superposition: One of the challenges here would have been 'transposition' issue, that is nodes responding to multiple things at various ranges of values. So one node might respond, oh add a '{' in the beginning of json and also respond to say word 'orange'. These are much more complicated than just one word examples I gave. It might be higher order, like if you see 'this' word at pos x, followed by 'that' word at pos y, and this 'other word' at pos z, then do something.
[2024-03-19, 10:46:37] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: I’m guessing by SFT you mean supervised fine tuning. This means the training is supervised -where you have specific input and output pairs vs unsupervised tasks like language modeling. 
Both terms typically refer to tuning all model parameters.
Would recommend you do some googling, read up on parameter efficient fine tuning and other stuff that comes up on googling.

We've cpu as well as GPU instance and both of them has same workspace memory attached to it so we just develop things on cpu machine and then turn it off and switch to GPU one

[2024-03-21, 12:39:55] ~ Sachin Kalsi: hi all,

OpenAI has been regularly updating the 3.5 model endpoints every ~3 months & Older endpoints are getting deprecated/removed, which is causing a lot of issues for many applications. 

And having to redo work to update prompts every time is redundant

Is anyone else dealing with this problem? 
Does anyone have another solution? I'm considering switching to Antropic.
[2024-03-21, 12:40:17] ~ Shanthi Vardhan: Did you check Twilio? I think they provide..
[2024-03-21, 12:47:48] ~ prasanna kumar: RAG ?
Then how does the bot know in real time whether a selected hotel on a selected day it is available or not ?
is it via  function calling ?
[2024-03-21, 13:02:50] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: Not sure of your exact use case but our same prompts have been actually getting better with the newer versions. They seem to follow more of the instructions. So we’ve chosen to not go with a specific model version but just use 3.5-turbo without any version specified. 
Whenever a new version comes out we run an eval to make sure stuff is working fine, so far it has..
[2024-03-21, 13:24:10] Priyank Agrawal: Somethings get better somethings break, very tough to test everything manually etc

[2024-03-21, 15:44:24] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: When fine tuning an LLM for text classification, does it make sense to make it output classes in text (like you would do if using OpenAI or others) or would it make sense to use a classification head?
[2024-03-21, 16:02:51] ~ prasanna kumar: hi @919550164716  @916309525405 
is navarasa 1.0 and 2.0 is just fine tuned LLM on indic languages are it undergone pretraining as well ?
[2024-03-21, 16:11:30] Ravi Theja: SFT. No pretraining
[2024-03-21, 16:12:29] ~ prasanna kumar: okay any specific reason for not pre-training it ?
[2024-03-21, 16:13:24] ~ Tanmay Sachan: is using classification heads on top of llms at all good practice?
llm embeddings aren't that good afaik based on early experimentations with gpt-3
[2024-03-21, 16:16:54] Ravi Theja: Since Gemma base model is having good understanding capabilities and already has tokens for Indic languages, we went ahead with direct SFT. But @919384207320 did experiment with pretraining for Tamil first and then SFT and it showcases improvement in results

[2024-03-21, 16:25:08] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: My thinking was that you have to do just one forward pass and will get values for all classes instead of autoregressive generation. Am not sure how that works out in practice though.

[2024-03-22, 09:50:26] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I don't have that many expectations. Right now it is just a better CoPilot with GPT4.
[2024-03-22, 09:51:08] Shimanta Generative AI: I am not using it for those purposes
I had to get on with writing code for a new project, in a new language
Cursor made things easier with codebase wide context: this made ramping up easier
Also it can index web sites and github repos, so do not need to switch between windows, i can just @ the necessary doc/codebase
[2024-03-22, 09:51:15] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: I really really like Cursor. Their copilot is also better than Github Copilot.

Had couple of questions:

What's the cost difference between a LLM vs trad NLP model?

If you're using a LLM, how does OSS fair against 3.5, and what inference providers have you used for OSS? Not looking to self host
[2024-03-22, 11:41:29] Ravi Theja: @919686643995 has worked on it.
[2024-03-22, 11:47:07] ~ Mohammed: What are some of the good platform where given datasets, you can finetune very easily and host the same finetuned model in the same platform?
[2024-03-22, 11:47:26] Phani Srikanth: For data classification, I’ve used OSS models and the Nous Research’s Hermes series of models are highly competitive. Haven’t used GPT models due to data privacy issues.

The inferencing speed of these OSS models is substantially higher than good old spacy models and hence the engineering requirements will have a say in the tradeoffs you will make.

More info in the above tagged message.

[2024-03-22, 12:17:25] Paras Chopra Wingify: Innovators dilemma happens when you attack business models, but if new tech is aligned to existing business model, that will get adopted sooner or later 

But yes attacking niche use cases and hopefully expanding from there is the only entry point
[2024-03-22, 12:18:13] Shimanta Generative AI: True, they have a head-start, but that is given they get into this, and when. I had heard rumours of apple partnering with google to run gemini nano on-device.
From what i saw, o1 is positioning itself as being the open ecosystem
[2024-03-22, 12:24:49] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: An open ecosystem with a head start does impact Apple’s business model on services and later, the app store business.
[2024-03-22, 12:29:57] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I wonder how many SaaS startups Apple may have killed by building best Siri, Mail, Calendar, Notes, Reminder, Maps applications but they are happy building mediocre and earning 30% app store commissions from better versions.
[2024-03-22, 13:13:21] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: If you have an LLM that’s working well, would it work to make it label a bunch of your data and train a spacy/bert type model on it?
[2024-03-22, 13:32:31] Phani Srikanth: Yes. It’s the perfect recipe for creating synthetic data and improving smaller models to achieve high classification performance.

[2024-03-22, 15:34:35] Avijit Thawani: I used a python script to add test cases from a csv, because apparently it doesn’t allow csv loading when you also need custom metric functions
[2024-03-22, 15:34:37] Puneet Lamba Aspiro: Then again, they’re mostly for prompt chaining/testing, so not sure if that serves what you’re looking for @919868221372

[2024-03-22, 18:20:46] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: just curious - what kind of customisation/automation would you want for llms or prompts ?
[2024-03-22, 18:24:34] Paras Chopra Wingify: The use case is that there are some prompts I run in more or less a specific flow in chat

Let’s say a brainstorming partner where I end up asking very similar questions 

Id like such prompts to be available as templates along with pre defined replies

So whenever I need to discuss in an issue, I can boot up an instance

Custom gpt comes close but not enough flexibility in specifying the flow of replies I end up doing (have to type the same thing again and again)

[2024-03-24, 18:13:32] ~ Shree: So, are you trying to use general intelligence to mimic the workings of recommendation algorithms ?

I tried making LLM solve basic DS problems which might require random forest for similar result
[2024-03-24, 18:55:44] Shivendu Kumar: Maybe just ask here? If anyone knows, they can respond.
[2024-03-24, 18:57:06] Priyesh OnFinance: Have done some work on this. Ask away here
[2024-03-24, 18:58:29] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: What’s the thesis? Why one wants to solve the recommendation problem with generative AI? More ellaboration on ‘why’ should help in answering the question.
[2024-03-24, 18:59:17] ~ Mayank Gupta: Yeah I'm very interested to understand this also. If anyone has cracked it, would be great to understand!
[2024-03-24, 19:00:31] ~ Abhilash Inumella: Let’s take dating for e.g. people queries would be like “want someone kind” or “want someone homely” or “want someone bold” — assuming all participants are honest and there is no objective truth in the face of these subjective elements — how can we model these scenarios to fetch profiles using prompting? ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-24, 19:03:16] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: How do you known someone is ‘kind’ without processing their entire chat history? And if you’re going to weight these attributes before hand, use XGBoost onwards.
[2024-03-24, 19:05:02] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Shouldn't force GenAI to do something that traditional ways can solve it easily. Because you're not generating anything here, matching parameters will be pre-processed.
[2024-03-24, 19:08:19] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Even then, it is difficult
[2024-03-24, 19:08:36] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Kind is an emotion, hard to express it in symbols
[2024-03-24, 19:09:06] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: How do you know someone's kind part. 

I am all for XGBoost
[2024-03-24, 19:09:59] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Of course, if the dating software industry worked well, we wouldn't have these many apps and declining birth rates.
[2024-03-24, 19:09:59] ~ Shree: How do we do right now?

Even after talking to them for years it's really tough
[2024-03-24, 19:12:15] ~ Shree: Whenever I try to approach a problem which uses LLMs 
I try to see if I can really solve it, and if yes. How?


You aren't training a neural network with many unknown factors when you are just fine-tuning in a small data or doing prompts.

You need to have some process which you can iterate.
[2024-03-24, 19:12:23] ~ Mayank Gupta: I was trying to read up but not able to understand usage of XGBoost here. A one liner please ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-24, 19:13:53] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: XGBoost == Kaggle Grandmaster == Gradient Boosted Trees 😂
[2024-03-24, 19:15:04] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I hope people understand I am not underestimating how much effort competitive programming takes. 

This is just light hearted humour
[2024-03-24, 19:16:16] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: It's a ranking problem than context discovery on a text corpus.
[2024-03-24, 19:26:43] Divya Tak: I think they're working as intended 😂😂. Increasing engagement on the apps
[2024-03-24, 22:09:19] ~ Abhilash Inumella: Revenue optimisation leads to this dichotomy to choose between showing matches versus keeping them hooked in the anticipation of a match — that’s why the business models are never pay per match. 

On the other hand one can argue that if a couple end up matching and get married it’ll lead to a ton of word of mouth because people will ask how and where they met. They say “we met on …”

This is a strange market that will never be a winner take all due to these reasons. 

* users are multi homing — using multiple apps
* ⁠users have specific preferences— that aren’t captured at all or at odds with the way profiles are designed

But then bootstrapping a new app will require solving the single-penguin-on-desert problem. Nobody wants to use a new dating app because it signals to the world they are so desperately single/lonely they are willing to try out a unknown dating app too.

So the question of whether AI can capture the specific preferences users have through the prompts and recommend profiles because even more important in this context.
[2024-03-24, 22:16:52] Divya Tak: But the premise that if you find the "perfect match" it would be successful relationship is itself flawed
[2024-03-24, 22:17:42] Divya Tak: It's not preferences match that determines the strength or longevity of a relationship.
[2024-03-24, 22:17:48] Divya Tak: It's more about working together
[2024-03-24, 22:18:13] Divya Tak: And figuring out things. And that's something that the dating apps are fully making people lose sight of
[2024-03-24, 22:18:38] Priyesh OnFinance: guys can we please cool down 😂, this is only AI
[2024-03-24, 22:19:23] Priyesh OnFinance: anyways my core point was that yes there are a lot of reasons why you need to use Gen AI for personalization/recommendation
[2024-03-24, 22:20:40] Priyesh OnFinance: the reasoning is as follows:
1) working in spaces where user data is available only at inference but not at training. so the best case you have is to figure out semantics of features from language not values of the field itself.
[2024-03-24, 22:21:50] ~ Mayank: a well defined problem should acknowledge the things it can't control. One of them being this. Definitely can't predict how humans evolve. Definitely not yet.
[2024-03-24, 22:21:52] Priyesh OnFinance: 2) the workflow where personalization is to be embedded is low-volume/niche. a counter example is like consumer social apps where all personalization goes into 1 of user or content. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-24, 22:23:13] Priyesh OnFinance: 3) the process of personalization is extremely "online" or heavily "multi-turn" where using a lot of past data will actually end up stagnating the new learning process to be extremely vanilla
[2024-03-24, 22:23:18] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Or domain expertise actually, as in take the example of music
[2024-03-24, 22:23:41] Priyesh OnFinance: yes basically I assume LLMs have no domain expertise other than that inferred from language
[2024-03-24, 22:24:08] Divya Tak: Correct but the point is, any preference system design is unsuitable for this problem
[2024-03-24, 22:25:55] Priyesh OnFinance: so in summary you would need to "generate" preferences where:
1. there isn't enough meaningful past data
2. past data is not a good indicator of future preferences
3. the list of features isn't known in its entirety
4. the list of features isn't static
[2024-03-24, 22:27:53] ~ Mayank: I'd say preference does play a role, but clearly the opinion doesn't seem to scale 😞
‎[2024-03-24, 22:29:18] Priyesh OnFinance: ‎image omitted
[2024-03-24, 22:29:41] Priyesh OnFinance: but the idea is if you look at the top right quadrant
[2024-03-24, 22:29:59] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Fair assumption, boils down to what percentage of thought is language or not I guess: Sapir Whorf
[2024-03-24, 22:30:15] Priyesh OnFinance: it gives you a kind of white space of businesses that operate on a limited number of super high paying customers
[2024-03-24, 22:30:34] Priyesh OnFinance: example: IT services, Financial services, Enterprise SAAS,GovTech so on ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-24, 22:31:46] Priyesh OnFinance: these businesses make a lot of money from a very small number of users. example: Axis Burgundy has 5k customers in total and that's the most in the private banking space afaik in India ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-24, 22:32:19] Priyesh OnFinance: and a max of 5-6 customer interactions per month
[2024-03-24, 22:32:36] Pratyush Choudhury: Yeah, but why meta learning?
[2024-03-24, 22:33:33] ~ Shree: Why not make a problem simpler 

"Will these two people continue talking longer or not ?"

Maybe after every 10 - 100 - 1000 texts you check the probability. (Not solving by just LLMs) 

If you make something that does this really well. 

You can add more factors (Past Backgrounds of two people) 

Past conversation of them with other people
[2024-03-24, 22:35:20] Priyesh OnFinance: and the total number of processes to be personalized using these few interactions are like ~20 (pre-sales, customer success, procurement, financial research, risk analysis) and so on.
[2024-03-24, 22:36:19] ~ Shree: Like it's a mixture of embedding a user information and an output. 

Somewhat in direction of YouTube video algorithm.

1. Will user like this X video ?
2. Will user continue watching this video he left ?
3. Will user like this new given video?
4. What should be the vectors of this new video ?
[2024-03-24, 22:49:27] Priyesh OnFinance: Yes but here is the problem in this right. you need to prepare 1 dataset per output format.
[2024-03-24, 22:51:10] Priyesh OnFinance: (user, content); (user, comments); (user, search result) and so on to train embeddings
[2024-03-24, 22:53:15] ~ Shree: Which can be future steps,
Maybe start with something small. 

Like net chance of survival of convo : It could be weighted average of past convo + Past 1000 convo + Past 100 convo

[2024-03-25, 08:48:10] Ravi Theja: are you looking for image embeddings or image to text as deplot is for image (plot) to text
[2024-03-25, 08:49:44] Neeraj Kumar: I am using GPT4vision preview model to generate caption text and tags for images.
[2024-03-25, 08:50:09] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: ImageBind is also good:
https://github.com/facebookresearch/ImageBind
[2024-03-25, 08:50:53] Kartik Mandaville: goal is to generate embeddings. Was trying deplot as a workaround
[2024-03-25, 09:22:12] ~ Shubham: The laion clip models are way better than OpenAI, at least for our use case. It makes sense since they're trained on a lot more data
[2024-03-25, 09:26:12] Kartik Mandaville: Nice. What are the costs of running that?
[2024-03-25, 09:27:17] ~ Shubham: We have built an in-house service for that, so not very sure about the costs. But there are different variants available, so you could pick the one according to your budget/needs
[2024-03-25, 09:27:33] ~ Shubham: I'm not aware of any API which provides those embeddings...
[2024-03-25, 09:53:45] Nirant K: ResNet34 ftw
[2024-03-25, 10:12:42] Rajesh Kumar SA : @919632834013 zero shot CLIP will be best option or any ViT based models. If you have training data, resNet based - convNeXt was the best last year in this class of models

The API track was more impressive, running with MagicLeap and robots and HeyGen (the last one made possible because the team was literally one of the first to get api access).
[2024-03-25, 12:32:09] Avijit Thawani: +1. This group could definitely pull off a better hackathon in Bangalore.
[2024-03-25, 12:33:15] ~ Shree: I think spending a weekend on cool project is fair, once couple of more ambitious projects start kicking in.

[2024-03-25, 18:47:27] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Sama was right. Forget about GPT4, no Indian company can pretrain foundation model from ground up, and beat GPT3.5.
[2024-03-25, 18:48:32] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: And they shouldn't try either. It is waste of resources. Let Meta burn 600k H100 and build a nice llama3 for us for free.

Specifically I will talk about data collection for audio data. Dr. Pratik is also doing some awesome work in the agri AI area. So we may not beat OpenAI(I have different ideas, but ok :)), but I think we will certainly be able to find AI solutions to our problems.
[2024-03-25, 21:01:23] Azhan Mohammed Generative AI WhatsApp Group: people who have used claude api models, what is a better way to provide examples:

1. providing them within the prompt using <example> tags
2. ⁠create user and assistant prompt chain where user is the example input and assistant has example output, with the final user message as the final query
[2024-03-25, 21:03:32] Shekar Ramachandran Intel Senior MTS: it does not say India is hopeless, he is more saying that its totally hopeless in competing w.r.t foundation model with us

[2024-03-26, 08:08:30] Sai Udaan: Could you elaborate ? You want a managed RAG? Or just a managed store on which you can build rag
[2024-03-26, 08:10:05] ~ Amitav (SaaSmonk): Both are options that we could do. Leaning towards the former
[2024-03-26, 08:12:07] Sai Udaan: I see, you could use our vishwa.ai platform itself. Has a combo of rag + fine-tuning.
Can connect you with the onboarding assistance if that helps. Should solve your usecase immediately

This creates a frontend chat and a backend RAG too. Could lobotomise to just use the RAG i guess? Supports FastAPI.
[2024-03-26, 08:20:15] ~ Amitav (SaaSmonk): sure, can have a chat
[2024-03-26, 08:24:28] ~ Amitav (SaaSmonk): Wanted a hosted solution, think this one requires our own vector store, etc
[2024-03-26, 08:26:39] Avijit Thawani: True that. there’s a nice installation step which asks if you want to use a managed vector store etc but you’d still have to upsert etc i believe. On the plus side this will be all open source and you’d have full control and visibility into the RAG pipeline. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-26, 08:28:14] ~ Amitav (SaaSmonk): Yep, and we will go down this path too down the line. For now just looking for something easy to plug in that lets us focus on our core use cases 🙂

[2024-03-26, 08:39:16] Avijit Thawani: Got it. Better to search for RAG as a service instead of knowledge base. More likely to find a solution- I’m sure there are lots online!

Issue being faced: I have multiple documents with nearly same information. While retrieving documents, I want to prioritise some documents over others based on some type of weights/variable which can further be used as a sorting mechanism. 

Basically I see this as a sorting vs filtering in the website. If Metadata for Vector DB is filtering what would be sorting? 

Thanks for your help in advance.

[2024-03-26, 10:39:52] Sumba: Reranker step after semantic based retrieval ?

[2024-03-26, 10:40:47] Ravi Theja: you want to sort based on which variable? time based?
[2024-03-26, 10:41:05] Aditya Agrawal: We have a weights variable.
[2024-03-26, 10:41:43] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: are there any places which have a collection of prompts for different usecases/prompting methods?

Have looked at promptingguide but looking for something with a collection of prompts
[2024-03-26, 10:47:49] Abhishek Maiti: Hi, are there any products/startups working on fetching finetuning data (prompts, completion pairs) easier from unstructured data (PDFs, texts etc)
[2024-03-26, 10:50:11] Aditya Agrawal: Problem is that retrieving might leave out the most relevant weight
[2024-03-26, 10:50:18] Aditya Agrawal: Pricing
[2024-03-26, 10:52:48] Nirant K: Request: It's good to mention your own product in replies — if it actually answers the question in the same message. If the link comes with a boiler plate like "transform X to Y" — we'll consider as spam since boileplate is worse than what GPT3.5 can do. 
[2024-03-26, 10:54:47] Sumba: Can your weights be precomputed when setting up the db? Or are your weights dependent on the query?
[2024-03-26, 10:55:32] Aditya Agrawal: Its pre-computed.
[2024-03-26, 10:55:51] Aditya Agrawal: While inserting data in the DB we have that data already
[2024-03-26, 11:00:28] Shivendu Kumar: Just modify AutoGPT source code yourself?
[2024-03-26, 11:02:03] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: What are the other variables for each doc/context that's relevant? Feels like it's possible to retrieve based on other aspects and then rerank. But if the query is purely on price, you may have to have intent detection on top to drive specific retrieval flows + prompts
[2024-03-26, 11:05:01] Sumba: why is there a need for a vector db im confused 
if its precomputed, you would just maintain a sorted datastructure where nodes are the documents (sorted based on your precomputed weights)
when query comes you just take the top K and do something?
[2024-03-26, 11:11:35] Azhan Mohammed Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Claude has their own prompt library.
[2024-03-26, 11:13:29] Azhan Mohammed Generative AI WhatsApp Group: A simple mongo db vector store with filter should work then. Apply the filter to get documents which are higher than desired threshold weight and then sort them.
[2024-03-26, 11:26:22] Nilesh Transcend: Doesn't every database (mongodb, postgres, elasticsearch, even sqlite) have support for vector search now?
[2024-03-26, 11:27:24] Shivendu Kumar: Just do re-ranking with reciprocal rank fusion. 

Sort your vector search results by your weight, just consider the position and discard the score/weight afterwards, take reciprocal and apply RRF to combine both. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-26, 11:28:33] Sumba: Fancy words is not the answer but lite
[2024-03-26, 11:40:48] Aditya Agrawal: But we do need functionality of Vector DB. We have 1 million vectors andneed similarity search
[2024-03-26, 11:41:23] Shivendu Kumar: I just described what I knew. Do you see any scope of improvement? :)
[2024-03-26, 11:41:38] Sumba: similarity search is needed after the weight based selection of documents ?
[2024-03-26, 11:42:49] Aditya Agrawal: As part of the search .. Becuase if we do later than very high chance that the right vector gets missed out.
[2024-03-26, 11:42:54] Aditya Agrawal: Like on a website you do sorting and filtering together.
[2024-03-26, 11:47:38] Shivendu Kumar: Oversample (set higher K) and re-rank.
[2024-03-26, 11:48:31] Shivendu Kumar: I'm assuming you have use case where you want to give results to the user based on semantic search but there are certain items that need to be boosted up (sales value or "trending")?
[2024-03-26, 11:48:36] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Yep, this looks like the best solution Aditya. If you don't get relevant info within the top k you should probably try to further enrich the data
[2024-03-26, 11:50:43] Aditya Agrawal: Exactly
[2024-03-26, 11:56:41] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: I was looking for something more model agnostic across usecases
[2024-03-26, 11:58:34] Azhan Mohammed Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Have tried the same prompt for Haiku, GPT 3.5 and Mixtral. Results were similarly consistent across all three models

[2024-03-26, 13:10:42] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: May be, however this was my observation,too. At least people I know and personally, chatgpt usage has gone down drastically. Unless hidden in the daily tools, like cursor, grammerly, etc, otherwise dedicated chatgpt app for prompting something is happening very rarely.
[2024-03-26, 13:23:22] Lavish 2017: umm won’t take that as the learning.

anton is just saying focus on cost optimisation after product launch and initial traction which is a timeless great lesson in itself but doesn’t mean he’s giving up on fine tuning

[2024-03-26, 13:39:11] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Fine tuning OSS models for general-purpose use cases. I think we are in agreement on narrow use cases and vertical models. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-26, 14:01:34] Lavish 2017: to everyone in the group - any good reasons why this should happen?

Is it because the self serve UX of chat (you only get when you ask) doesn’t work for the masses?
[2024-03-26, 14:04:16] Lavish 2017: assuming the chart is correct, haven’t verified myself. I would have never bet that ChatGPT growth will slow down even if everyone else is trying to take their users (Poe, Perplexity, Companion apps, etc)

Is it because of the competition of clones in app stores and SEO?
[2024-03-26, 14:13:46] Rounak Datta Hackathon Winner: It's like that n(equity investors in IN) logic right? Those who seek value - are already users, others wouldn't stick around even if introduced to them multiple times.
[2024-03-26, 14:17:03] ~ Kifilshah: I think the chat UX is extremely  limiting. I share a chatgpt account with my family and they find it difficult to articulate what they need. They end up typing short sentences or phrases which really limits how much you can get done with gpt-4
[2024-03-26, 14:19:15] ~ Bharath: Interesting. What would you have ideally preferred?
[2024-03-26, 14:19:55] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: It could mostly be people (non-power users) themselves don’t know how to use it or when to use it.

Outside narrow group of early adopters Poe,Perplexity is not well known.


Chat also presents a very high friction from UX perspective.

Integrated GenAI products will do better as they don’t need user to explicitly ask or type their ask.

For example,Canva and Notion have host of AI based summarising,rewrite features.
From personal example I’m seeing people use that a lot more compared to just ChatGPT.
‎[2024-03-26, 14:22:09] Anuj Srivastava OnFinance: ‎image omitted
[2024-03-26, 14:22:56] ~ Kifilshah: Really haven't seen a better alternative. Chat has a learning curve w.r.t promoting and you need to be good with English. 
But I wouldn't use anything other than chat for whatever I use gpt-4. I like the flexibility
[2024-03-26, 14:26:15] Rounak Datta Hackathon Winner: I'm sure voice mode contributed to the uptick around Sept/Oct. I wonder what else could be a _more_ convenient UX ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-26, 14:27:10] ~ Kifilshah: Voice mode is promising but I need to start other people to use it too so I won't feel like a weirdo xD
[2024-03-26, 14:27:26] ~ Kifilshah: *need other people to..
[2024-03-26, 14:29:37] Rounak Datta Hackathon Winner: And remember how GPT-4V was marketed as an emergency helper when your bicycle broke down. Unfortunately it doesn't work as good in those situations, so it seemed an overpromise use-case wise. Technological leap wise - mindblowing, no doubts, and we'll eventually get there
[2024-03-26, 14:30:43] ~ Bhumil Haria: Personally I feel chat/freetext is the best UX only for the long tail, where it's not possible to reduce/encapsulate the problem into a smaller class. Like Excel.

For all other cases where encapsulation is possible, chat is a terrible UX simply because (a) high friction and (b) power users in any use case have a somewhat shared context (in the problem domain), so the text is a downgrade from that.
[2024-03-26, 14:36:07] ~ Shree: I think it's just that the product isn't made well and intuitive
 
1. GPTs: Good but only accessible with subscription, making it available for just a really small audience than that of AI. If it was somewhere as open as apks are there in Android and available to all would have invited more trials. 
2. Huge set of people don't know about it: Like people have heard a bit about it, but when I go in tier 2-3 people haven't even used and the one who did really struggle in promoting. If audio comes and much more intuitive work happens (like Alexa) people will use it more


Like I always thought what if Meta releases a bot on WhatsApp/insta, really simple but powerd by LLAMA but free of cost, would it have more users than ChatGPT in a month, and like consistent monthly users?
[2024-03-26, 14:57:38] Lavish 2017: could you run an experiment of getting your family to use any of the custom GPTs which adds a self-prompt via keywords and see if adoption improves? I agree people are used to of searching on google than asking.

but def an incremental improvement, won't actually solve the unknown root cause of why the product is not retaining the incoming users.
[2024-03-26, 15:04:56] Lavish 2017: also sharing my top 5 nearest neighbours of ChatGPT if it helps more people discover:
1. Pi.ai - for long voice chats when you want to question / understand something
2. explorer.globe.engineer for getting a quick tree on an unknown topic
3. Perplexity for medium google search replacement
4. you.com research mode for medium+ google search replacement or to chat with a document/website
5. Claude.ai - for all non transactional text needs (way^⁴⁰ more human)
[2024-03-26, 15:05:43] ~ Kifilshah: I haven't tried these custom GPT myself. Will give this a shot
[2024-03-26, 15:15:46] ~ Samruddhi Mokal: Have been trying Pi for a while.
It's good for human-like responses but not that good if you have to brainstorm with it. If you ask it multiple times for a similar task with a few tweaks, it stops working by saying it can't keep doing it forever
[2024-03-26, 15:20:35] Karthik S Delhivery: Second this on the chat UX. Once the questions / needs cross a particular complexity it’s impossible to get through (unless you’re a prompt engineer, maybe!!). 

Also why I’m bearish on copilots. Too much reliance on humans asking intelligent questions in a way that the LLM can understand

Very insightful conversation.

TL/DR :
- some insights into Elon's leadership style & focus on small, technical teams
- Maybe the GPU has outlived it's usefulness.Room for newer hardware architectures which are designed for distributed training at massive scale and more fault tolerant 
- Fundamental algorithm Innovation : Andrej says there is 1000 to million X factor for improvement to make models more energy efficient (reference to the human brain)
- Succeasor to the transformer architecture and innovation in the ml architectures
- Curremt ai architectures are doing step 1 of alpha go - imitation learning.RLHF is not great , we need better RL models ‎<This message was edited>

@919632834013 and his team are seeing openai beat cohere, jina which is different than MTEB scores.

Wondering if any of you has done similar study and observed different results. Would be helpful for anyone in general.
[2024-03-27, 16:30:47] Lavish 2017: I would check all the gateway/router products and utilise their credits and use claude models

also message & ask them for it
[2024-03-27, 17:03:52] Nirant K: I've seen similar results myself. OpenAI-3-Large beats most OSS. I've not tried MixedBread though, and below 512 tokens — it feels competitive. I've not included Cohere in benchmarks because I had compliance reasons to exclude them.
[2024-03-27, 17:05:23] Nirant K: Tip: If you can use dense embedding to get your top K(=100,1000) and spend the extra 200-1000ms, ColBERT is a great re-ranker because it handles company-specific jargon quite well. 
[2024-03-27, 17:08:40] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: What does cohere rerank relevancy means
[2024-03-27, 17:14:17] Kartik Mandaville: yes we use cohere but trying out jina which is better. Will try out ColBERT too

[2024-03-27, 17:50:27] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Usually it comes down to connecting LLMs to knowledge using RAG. There are direct APIs for RAG ( Cohere, subtl, nuclia ) , or using frameworks like langchain/llama index to test out different approaches. I think the community can help better if you are specific with the ask

[2024-03-27, 17:57:34] Paras Chopra Wingify: curious if any real world agent use case is there right now?

(not demos like devin, but actual adopted use cases)

see a lot of hype around agents.
[2024-03-27, 17:58:46] ~ YP: You mean every answer is right in LLM world atleast? I originally meant from the POV that as LLMs get bigger, they have better parsing capabilities and that gets us through with most of the tasks. 
It's also being able to update, delete, all incontext. With claude their team would've taken care of this in claude opus for example. Backtracking to a previous point in multiturn is also one sort of reasoning.
[2024-03-27, 17:58:53] Nirant K: Depending on what you call agents — reflection is used widely, and so are tools under the branding of function calling

[2024-03-27, 18:01:15] Paras Chopra Wingify: i agree, agents is not a well formed category
[2024-03-27, 18:01:32] Nirant K: What you and I call "agents" is what Dr. Andrew puts under planning — and I've not seen anything outside of demos for that. Not even academic work which sometimes tend to be honest but narrow because they're early.

The Minecraft paper/Voyager on planning and tool usage continues to be a trend setter almost a year later: https://github.com/MineDojo/Voyager
[2024-03-27, 18:02:43] ~ YP: Are there RL implementations in OSS, I've heard a lot of proprietary agents use RL so that their agent doesn't diverge from it's goal.
[2024-03-27, 18:02:59] Nirant K: The last part, which is multi-agent collaboration e.g. AutoGen — is much better defined and used in robotics, specially warehousing robotics is right now suffering from a memory alignment and fails to stick to the long term task
[2024-03-27, 18:06:17] ~ Mayank Gupta: Currently the focus seems to be heavy on the autonomy part of the agents it seems, whereas critical components like planning, memory etc seem to be under-cooked I guess.
[2024-03-27, 18:07:50] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: This is a solid explanation of non knowledge oriented use cases. The hope is definitely that tech stacks are fully grounded in some form of referenced data

[2024-03-28, 17:54:16] ~ Pathik Ghugare: I've a question to those who've used gpt4v on azure 
I noticed that while using its API I've faced issues at OCR level as well as understanding w.r.t my prompt and images but when the same deployment, prompt, parameters, image is being used on their platform (oai.azure.com) results are totally different and accurate

So I was wondering if azure is doing any sort of image preprocessing in the backend before calling these models
[2024-03-28, 17:57:13] Dhruv Anand: yes, there is an OCR enhancement that can be optionally applied within the Azure OpenAI service: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/ai-services/openai/how-to/gpt-with-vision?tabs=rest,system-assigned,resource#use-vision-enhancement-with-images

Are you referring to the 1st party OpenAI API in the first case?
[2024-03-28, 18:00:43] ~ Pathik Ghugare: I am not utilising any of the OCR services provided by Azure 
I've kept the Vision enhancement off so it's pure gpt4v doings it's thing ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-03-28, 18:03:06] Dhruv Anand: in general, it's very likely that Azure and 1st party OpenAI are hosting different versions and configurations of the GPT4V model. They haven't been particularly careful about this with other models either.
[2024-03-28, 18:11:09] ~ Pathik Ghugare: True but I really doubt if that's the case since the deployment that I've created is the same on platform as well as API 
I also check the network tab and they're calling the same endpoint in the back as well 🥲
[2024-03-28, 18:14:05] Dhruv Anand: oh ok, so you're comparing between the Azure OpenAI Studio chat playground and the Azure OpenAI API itself. You're right, those responses should not be different

[2024-03-29, 00:03:56] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Andrew Ng talks about agents which reflect on their output and have reflection abilities in the latest addition of “the batch”

“Reflection is a relatively basic type of agentic workflow, but I've been delighted by how much it improved my applications’ results in a few cases. I hope you will try it in your own work. If you’re interested in learning more about reflection, I recommend these papers:

“Self-Refine: Iterative Refinement with Self-Feedback,” Madaan et al., 2023
“Reflexion: Language Agents with Verbal Reinforcement Learning,” Shinn et al., 2023
“CRITIC: Large Language Models Can Self-Correct with Tool-Interactive Critiquing,” Gou et al., 2024”

I am thinking of sharing our journey through Engineering Blogs, Talks, etc. for the same. It'd be great to know what the expectations from such knowledge sharing activities would be (or any advice in general since I have not done this before!)
[2024-03-29, 00:19:42] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: very cool rajaswa !
maybe have like a public online talk by your engineering folks which could share the journey from idea —> design —> architecting —>deployment —> monitoring & performance

you could structure it as a series of talks if its too much to cover in one talk !

i personally find videos more engaging than blogs, but you could also share blogs and repos if you are open-sourcing some aspects of your system

[2024-03-29, 06:21:11] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Interesting. I have been wishing for automated testing for a while now. Seems wishes come true
[2024-03-29, 06:22:52] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Also I am fairly confident this same prompt would perhaps work on GPT4 with the XML lingo changed to markdown lingo. 

Not too sure why. But GPT responds really well to markdown in general
[2024-03-29, 08:11:51] Nirant K: GPT was originally a model called Codex, used for next code token prediction. Codex is what formed the first Github Copilot release as well — and it was quite bad at following instructions.
[2024-03-29, 08:13:58] Nirant K: OpenAI learnt from the davinci-003 usage pattern that chat was the most frequent, and "general enough" usage pattern and they popularised the instruct idea with ChatGPT (the product) and later API. But they had a challenge for ChatGPT — how do we improve reasoning, because davinci wasn't getting better quickly enough with larger runs. 

So they added the davinci data to pre-training and improved Codex, and the post training team added instruct ideas — to get ChatGPT user experience!

And that's why, unlike most other models which filter out code and markdown — GPT is quite good and sensitive to it.

[2024-03-29, 20:32:55] Anubhav mishra Zupay: I think sooner or later the basic answer engine will be open source and at par with perplexity , merely an answer engine will have 0 cost to switch imo. Maybe for perplexity they might want to do reasoning based browsing that can be used to execute web based tasks + answer engine eg( querying mixpanel and coming back with an answer). Else I'm sure currently a lot of traffic is anyway going to Meta AI on WA and so will it go to Google and well as, when and if they improve.

1. generate failing tests for the behaviour u want with the model
2. then the model generates the code to address

which is the TDD approach with code gen. would guess this would produce more reliable code over time and a better UX for developers


wondering if anyone has seen something like this should be out there

[2024-03-30, 02:51:57] Pratyush Choudhury: Multiple flaws/gaps w/ this:
* This is bookings, not revenue - not all of it will convert. So actual “value” won’t accrue & what accrues won’t be much.
* ⁠AI will actually require a lot of services - a lot of revenue $$s will accrue to them but these $$s of revenue isn’t as high value/quality as what a SaaS app vendor will make so the comparison is silly,
[2024-03-30, 02:52:53] Priyesh OnFinance: Yes but I am sure @917737887058 would remind us on how much he would love to book $600mn. 😂

[2024-03-30, 02:53:11] Priyesh OnFinance: in enterprise
[2024-03-30, 02:54:32] Pratyush Choudhury: Again, missing a lot of nuance for generalizations 😕 
* Their bookings for H1 is $40B of which only $600M is from Gen AI
[2024-03-30, 02:56:06] Pratyush Choudhury: And their overall revenue has remained flat which means these $600M bookings are from the existing IT spendpool enterprises would have committed to spend on Accenture - same wine, different bottle as they say 🙂
[2024-03-30, 02:57:08] Pratyush Choudhury: Put another way, something like “don’t migrate my Oracle database to the cloud this Q1, let’s do customer support chatbot POC using wrappers around GPT4 for the same $s instead”
[2024-03-30, 02:58:53] Pratyush Choudhury: I should write something on this tomorrow morning maybe, loads of (online) commentary but seemingly no one has read beyond the second bullet in a 14 page PDF
[2024-03-30, 03:11:19] ~ Ankit Sharma: what are some of the ways through which you can restrict an LLM’s output?
example: let’s say someone is using GPT for chatbot and a user repeatedly asks something else (out of the loop topic) and the LLM starts responding to that..
[2024-03-30, 07:51:10] ~ ~I: I have been using GPT assistants, but these are very slow and expensive. I have looked for resources on how they implemented the assistants, but I am not getting much information. Can someone explain to me or provide a resource for that?
[2024-03-30, 08:41:53] Karthik S Delhivery: Another thing is - this is gross bookings. Which is a superset of revenue. We don’t know yet how much of this has gone to the likes of OpenAI (and id imagine a LOT). 

So saying “implementers get most of the revenues” doesn’t make sense

[2024-03-30, 11:06:13] Shivendu Kumar: https://atlas.nomic.ai

Otherwise, some vector DBs like Qdrant have this feature in built in the dashboard.

[2024-03-30, 11:07:25] ~ Narayan Sharma: Is atlas open sourced?

[2024-03-30, 11:09:33] ~ Narayan Sharma: I used it in mid-2023. Idk if it still works but I guess as long as you have a collection of embeddings, you can index them using faiss and this should plug right in.
[2024-03-30, 11:40:37] Shreyas Desai SuperU: cool, i'll check it out

[2024-03-30, 17:33:43] ~ Ayush Thakur: 1. Use Pydantic model to do function calling. This way you can restrict the LLM's output.
2. You can also try to classify the intent of the query. Based on the classified intent, enhance the system prompt to add some instructions to ignore such queries. 
3. Add a few shot examples in the system prompt to let your model know what is a bad query to answer and what should the answer be.
4. Google OpenAI guardrail. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-03-31, 02:38:59] Dhruv Anand: Something I'm not sure about: 
Does matryoshka speed up inference when requesting fewer dimensions?
Because if not, the entire concept is not of much use, as int8 and binary quantization provide much more of an efficiency gain while still retaining the ability to rerank for maintaining accuracy to reasonable levels.
[2024-03-31, 02:48:07] ~ Nayan Shah: "Despite the embeddings being smaller, training and inference of a Matryoshka model is not faster, not more memory-efficient, and not smaller. Only the processing and storage of the resulting embeddings will be faster and cheaper."

https://sbert.net/examples/training/matryoshka/README.html#inference

I think its more for the usecase where u are scaling it for millions of vectors or more , and using some kind of DISK ann kind of thing , and storing the original embeddings in disk , and using the lower dimension embedding for candidate retrieval in ram and then doing the reorder with original embedding to get best result in your retirval stage .
[2024-03-31, 05:26:17] Avijit Thawani: How does one hire good prompt engineers? How do we even assess them?

This is the biggest challenge with OCRs as the input gets worse and worse.
[2024-04-01, 08:12:39] Saurav Tomar GenerativeAI WA Group: Thanks. My input data is fairly consistent. Gpt4 vision does not do a good job recognising handwriting, but you have to kind of trick it to do the OCR as it will reject direct OCR requests.

[2024-04-01, 13:14:40] Ruthvik Reddy: Thiss. It's gets really frustrating because of Microsoft's world-class UI/UX. There won't be any indication on Azure OpenAI studio for region specific unavailability while trying to deploy the model. And their quotas page makes it even more confusing.
[2024-04-01, 13:19:56] ~ Pathik Ghugare: Correct
Even I struggled a lot in setting up the same for the first time but I always refer their docs so it helped 😅 ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-01, 13:22:51] Ruthvik Reddy: Exactly. The point of UI is to interact with the platform directly. The Azure OpenAI experience makes it feel like referring to API docs for using a UI, which pretty much defeats the purpose of a UI.

Quick Rest api for embedding models
[2024-04-01, 13:30:44] Nirant K: Built with FastEmbed xD

Cc @19377081307 you'd asked for this
[2024-04-01, 13:51:29] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Struggled with this on production workloads. Limited availability is one of the challenges with Azure OpenAI
[2024-04-01, 13:53:47] Rajaswa Patil: Oh yeah, this is a big problem.

Also, I realized that if you choose the “Default (latest model version)” as the option for model lifecycle during deployment - it chooses the wrong option (Ex - gpt-3.5-0301 a model from last year)

That breaks things too.
[2024-04-01, 13:55:19] Rajaswa Patil: We have a dedicated contact at Azure for our LLM needs and they just keep pushing GPT-4 and Provisioned Throughput as the solution for all the issues around region specific availability and quotas.
[2024-04-01, 13:59:32] Rajaswa Patil: The whole PR of Enterprise-ready GenAI stack is also not very convincing. There’s not much difference in OpenAI and Azure OpenAI for enterprises. Both are stateless services with shared hardware (unless you go for provisioned throughput)

In fact Azure has this extremely dangerous hidden caveat that they store your data for manual Abuse Monitoring, breaking all terms of privacy & data security you might have with your enterprise customers. There’s no UI to opt out of that either, the contact at Azure shares a form and you need to fill that out so they can manually opt you out from that program.

Response time is really high (both time to first token and token per second). Looks like the only way to mitigate response time issues is to take PTU. Response time with direct calls to openAi endpoint is much better.

[2024-04-02, 12:24:47] Vetrivel PS: Hi friends, I have a doubt please help with all possible options. 

After extracting the documents and creating Chunks of documents and creating Embeddings in a RAG framework, how to restrict the metadata (example : Filename) 

Say from a user query we get 2 chunks from document a and 3 chunks from document b, how to use the Retriever class of LangChain to dynamically filter based on metadata ( restrict information to a specific file or a set of file ) ?
👏
For Example : Show 2 chunks from Document A and restrict 3 chunks from Document B ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-02, 13:02:11] Shivendu Kumar: Assuming the setup is like this where the document A owned only by a user or a set of users:

You can provide a {"user": "user-id"} field while inserting the document into your vector DB. While querying, filter based on the user field. 

Does this answer your question?
[2024-04-02, 13:02:26] ~ Arsalaan: Hi you can define multiple query engines for multiple documents
[2024-04-02, 13:13:22] Kaushik Bokka: not a good idea to add user information as metadata while indexing. can define a SQL Record Manager to define user rules, and keep it aligned with the vector db.

@919003135354 metadata filtering should solve your problem.

[2024-04-02, 13:26:50] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yup, user permission in SQL with document IDs, and discard after retrieval. If the filtering is needed at the retrieval level then pass the list of Doc IDs in the filter. However, I don't know how one can deal with the second option if the number of files is huge, and in the first option, how to avoid if the matched docs are unauthorized in majority of cases. ‎<This message was edited>

Don't think it warrants LLM enough, niche case where one could train a model with synthetic data from an LLM which would always be preferred for production(which is pointed out in this doc too)

Now they don't look at logs and expect engineers to extract and provide such information.

Imagine LLM based chat interface answering queries in natural language and relevant log lines in code block!

For example a prompt

Apna time ayega.
[2024-04-03, 12:44:02] Shuveb Hussain Zipstack: This is going to be super slow and super expensive. Also, this is not exactly leveraging LLM for their strengths. Logs are ultimately, structured data. One way to think about achieving this is: use typical DBs and inverted index systems to store the logs. Use LLMs to build a natural language to query interface to those DBs. That should solve your problem more efficiently, using the right system for its strengths.

[2024-04-03, 14:17:07] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Not to sound negative- I still think that if both ends (logs and the LLM based log parsing) are tied together there is something viable here. Then again some company like Dynatrace or VMWare will easily disrupt this in a year or two.

I have tried adding the instructions but that seems like a hack ( which doesn't work always ) . Was looking for a way through function calling🤔


 Has anyone tried it? Also how to not let it reveal about uploaded documents and add  functionality to search through web?  I have tried doing all changes in the prompt , it still reveals the documents🥲.

Also it keeps on hallucinating as well .
Should I switch to Langchain to let it work? 

Thanks
[2024-04-03, 20:25:54] ~ Pathik Ghugare: which model are you using ?

There's already a JSON mode available for gpt3.5 turbo and gpt4 models

[2024-04-03, 20:56:34] ~ Ganaraj: Hi Guys, 

Is there a way to get LLM to not hallucinate for a specific task ? The task itself is pretty straight forward, for ex: Sort the following in some logical order ... 2014-12-01, 1st Feb 2024, jan-2025... etc etc.. and the list goes on for like another 50-100 values. Please note: We dont know what these values are going to be before hand ( programmatically ), or we would have done the sorting after normalizing programmatically instead of LLM. 

The LLM can do the sorting perfectly fine, but the problem is that since the list is quite long, when it returns the sorted values, it hallucinates quite a lot. Is there any way to reduce / mitigate / manage this effectively ?
[2024-04-03, 20:59:19] ~ Gaurav Chandak: Based on my understanding of the use case, you can divide it into smaller tasks if each of the dates are available separately.

Ask LLM to convert a date into a specific format. After doing it for all dates, sort it programmatically.
[2024-04-03, 21:02:04] ~ Ganaraj: Its not just dates. It can be anything. the dates was just an example
[2024-04-03, 21:02:04] ~ ~I: have you tried using JSON mode with giving the exact JSON format in the prompt?
it works for me all the time
[2024-04-03, 21:18:13] ~ Ganaraj: This is a live example if anyone is interested:

my_list = '90 - 140, Min 130, Max 170, Min-95, 100, Min 70, Min-130, Max-100, Min 95, 145, Max-170, Max125, Max-125, Min-70, 70 - 110, 80 - 150, 100 - 200, Max 100, 70, 60 - 100, 120 - 190'

Thank you!
[2024-04-03, 21:57:47] ~ ☆Sreedevi: I had used langchain's JsonOutputParser to get the output in therequired json format. See https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers/types/json for an example.
[2024-04-03, 22:02:38] ~ ~I: assistants API doesn't have JSON mode yet
but gpt4 is good at instructions
it usually gives only the JSON back
as a fallsafe you can write a script to extract just the JSON
[2024-04-03, 22:03:38] ~ ~I: also from the testing we have done assistants API is very slow and expensive too
so wouldn't recommend for production use case
[2024-04-03, 22:15:38] ~ Pramod: Since assistants API doesn’t have native json output support, I just paired it with a completion API call to gpt 3.5 to extract json. It worked for my use case. I haven’t spent time looking for alternatives. This was around a month ago

[2024-04-04, 16:33:04] Priyank Agrawal: I ran a very small benchmark test on Groq Mistral MoE7x8 v/s Azure 3.5 turbo — 

As expected Groq had fast first token BUT surprisingly fir sentence and end of line was slower than Azure 3.5 turbo.
i.e groq’s streaming speed it low which is odd because many benchmarks are saying 500 tok/sec and i am barely using a chat usecase which is less than 100 output tok per request.

Any one has an idea why that would be the case?

[2024-04-05, 10:49:28] Vetrivel PS: *Current implementation:* 
*Input*- N number of names
*Output* - N number of Videos 
*Execution time* - Approx 10 mins per video
*Instance type* - P3.2x (1 GPU /  8 vCPU)
*Configuration*- AWS EC2 holds 5 python scripts. All these scripts are executed by SSM commands inside single lambda using S3 triggers. These script will run one after other based on completion.

*Problem:* The execution time for 1 complete run(5 scripts sequentially) is approx. 10 mins  Running multiple executions will consume lot of ec2 memory, time & cost. Completion of every execution has to be quick and fast.
 
*Expected solution:* 
	1. Containerize the lambda code 
	2. Multiple execution needs to be performed parallelly to produce more outputs in short time
	3. Time and memory needs to be saved with auto scaling/other scaling methods

[2024-04-05, 14:23:29] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: https://www.w3.org/reports/ai-web-impact/ A good survey of ML model impact on the Web.
[2024-04-05, 14:26:24] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Nice. I was thinking of just such a thing when washing dishes. Jokes apart the combination of keyboard use and dishwashing (and driving, and random other things) does lead to repetitive strain injury so an AI enabled dish washer would be a true shot in the arm for many people. Elders especially benefit from such automations

[2024-04-05, 17:28:57] ~ Bijon Guha: Hello
In my team we are trying to bring in Copilot license for all the developers like any other microsoft tool like excel ppt etc. Management is requesting to quantify benefits in terms coding effort reduction because of presence of this tool. Has anyone performed any “cost vs benefits” exercise for copilot ?
[2024-04-05, 17:31:07] ~ Bijon Guha: Except for github who have performed voting based experiments on participants. It’s available on their website
[2024-04-05, 19:23:15] Phani Srikanth: I’ve heard companies spend approximately $14/month/user for co-pilot for business.
The cost/benefit is very compelling at that price point. Given an average engineering salary (averaged across US & India), if you get like ~17 minutes of time a month back, you’ve broken even. (I’ve done this many times over..)
[2024-04-05, 20:07:46] Kesava Reddy: My son uses this heavily... He is a fan
[2024-04-05, 20:14:18] Dr. Ashith Generative AI WA Group: We did a pilot for our company.  Can share deets in DM
[2024-04-05, 20:14:42] Kesava Reddy: In terms of Return on Investment (RoI), at what point does it make sense to opt for Code Lama over Copilot? This includes factors like deployment, maintenance, ML engineering, integration, and GPU infrastructure costs.
[2024-04-05, 20:23:46] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Unless you have a proprietary code base that you want code Llama to fine-tune on it
[2024-04-05, 20:25:27] ~ Bhumil Haria: I also typically use the same line of reasoning. Reduce the problem to a dollar value and it's an easier sell. Same reason why Jetbrains/similar licenses are very cheap if you do the math.
[2024-04-05, 20:27:46] ~ Vinay Kumar: May be off the current discussion a bit.. but still bit relevant... I have this dilemma, nothing targeted against any company or leaders. 

The same leaders from all the companies who are now promoting coding automation, which eventually will lead to a culture where the new generation would not know how to code things from scratch, which might be also okay in future. 

Would the same companies(you know the names) " ... *would they remove coding and DSA round from scratch for their hiring process*" ? Or Would they let interviewee use such AI tool during the interview process?

If not then how is it sustainable that inside their company they say learn coding and outside their company they say no need to code things, my AI product/tool will code things for you, 

Is that sustainable? For all? For everyone?

Would love your perspectives on this.. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-05, 20:46:07] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: The flip side of this is that coding automation is sought after by business managers who seek profitability. Perhaps they too will understand the risks of using models to write code, both for workforces and for code maintainability. Short termism exists in all industries and people seeking short term benefits often gravitate to disruptive tech. The missing element is perhaps education and the opportunity to think and consider all aspects of the use of something like Copilot.
[2024-04-05, 20:49:59] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Continuity of skill development requires mentors - even the teams that built the Saturn V moon rocket had people who died out, taking deep tacit knowledge to their graves. Often societies rediscover skills after experts and proponents don't develop a second layer and coach the next generation. It may help to look at Cobol programmers for example and learn how new ones join the fold and why. I would guess it is because an ecosystem exists to support the use of the skill by human exponents. And by extension, will Cobol programmers really disappear once AI programmers take over Cobol programming? I doubt it.
[2024-04-05, 21:06:59] ~ Bhumil Haria: IMHO that's a weird question for the following reason: Coding automation does not imply no developers. If you automate 90% of all work and are hiring just one developer for the remaining 10%, you need some mechanism to evaluate them, and DSA is one such mechanism that is widely known today (regardless of effectiveness).

That said, my perspective on that question is that 
(1) humans take time to change, and stragglers make the bulk of most sample populations
(2) interviews themselves will evolve once DSA/other questions start providing more noise than signal, but the end state is unpredictable and will appear organically
[2024-04-05, 21:15:43] Paras Chopra Wingify: Companies test for skills that are needed, so if certain skills are not needed, why would they test for it?
[2024-04-05, 21:28:54] Jithin James: on a very high level every employee is just hired to solve problems that increase buisness value or figure our new avenues to create buisness value. We just love working on tech and software so we help them there 🙂

Tech stack has been adding more abstractions on top of each other but are just tools to get a job done (increase revenue, decrease cost)(for a business). What excites me about all the AI progress is that as a individual developer I get more tools to solve even harder technical problems and create a bigger impact(which always excites me). there should be a market for those skills always I would guess.

my worry is that the gap between people who can leverage these tools to create impact will keep increasing and the impact they bring to the table also increases. There would be a big education gap and in training people to adapt to these technologies would be harder, rate of innovation will be way higher. 

but the same tools can help here too
[2024-04-05, 21:32:57] Kartik Mandaville: We give github copilot to all our developers but only 60% people actually use it. Its just easier to write tests, basic scaffolding, function docs
[2024-04-05, 21:35:29] Bulia Siddharth Aurashop: If you are trying co-pilot, would suggest to try out cursor too. I found it way better than github copilot.
[2024-04-05, 21:39:25] Soham (Composio.dev): Actually one reason you can use cursor is that it can be usage based pricing (just use your own API key).

This can give you actual usage metrics and you kinda only pay for it if developers actually use it.
[2024-04-05, 21:40:02] Pratyush Choudhury: And turns out to be probably cheaper than Github Copilot as well?
[2024-04-05, 21:41:22] Soham (Composio.dev): Depends on how much you code. Way more expensive for me as I only use GPT4 turbo. Cheaper models are useless. It becomes equally expensive if you just pay for it at $20 as then they bear the cost of models.
[2024-04-05, 21:42:05] Soham (Composio.dev): Currently $80 per month for me.
[2024-04-05, 21:43:19] Soham (Composio.dev): But if you are a startup, then another hack is to apply for Microsoft credits and don't worry.
[2024-04-05, 21:51:10] Pratyush Choudhury: Wow, have you tried Opus?
[2024-04-05, 21:51:51] Dr. Ashith Generative AI WA Group: could you expand on the skill gap aspect
[2024-04-05, 21:57:17] Tanuj Bhojwani: Hello, are any current voice generators good enough at generating booming announcer voices? I would really like one for a personal fun project I'm trying!
[2024-04-05, 21:58:06] Nipun Jain: What’s up?
[2024-04-05, 21:58:43] Tanuj Bhojwani: Is that for me? Trying to make Hogwarts' style talking paintings.
[2024-04-05, 22:00:41] Kesava Reddy: In five years it may not be, but for sure in 10 years. 

Programmers may not disappear, requirements for COBOL programming skills will disappear. 


It's natural for certain skills to fade in relevance over time while others become less important. In primitive times, skills like climbing trees and swimming were essential for survival, but today, they're less common. Similarly, skills like programming may also follow this pattern
[2024-04-05, 22:16:07] ~ Bhumil Haria: Any place to follow this work? Super curious

<He/She - gender of voice you choose> announced in a Booming Voice <give more context , like in a Stadium>  “ <text>” 

It’ll basically read it like it reads a book, and emulate <text> as best as it can, you’ll then have to clean  by cutting the extra part in Prefix in something like Audacity to get what you want.

[2024-04-07, 18:51:19] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: What is your recommendation for realtime STT models ?

 I have tried deepgram and assembly ai but they are not very good.

The transcription does not need to be exactly real time.

 It can suggest correction for old transcriptions as it gains more context.

For example "melon must is born in Africa" is 

As the model does transcription for new words.

It can suggest that the previous word was Elon Musk
[2024-04-07, 19:18:15] ~ ~I: that's interesting
as I used Assembly and Deepgram both
I found Deepgram transcription very good for my use case
even still I went with Assembly because of its LLM integrations ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-07, 19:34:32] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: Was it realtime?
[2024-04-07, 19:35:45] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: Interesting approach you have some demo or code that I can look into
[2024-04-07, 19:35:53] Soham (Composio.dev): If you don't want it to be real time, the best approach could be an agentic way to do it. So transcribe (Provider 1) -> Agent decide what portions look bad (Transcription fails) -> Transcribe (Provider 2) (Those portions) -> and so on. 

Ideally I have seen different models have different strengths over accents, speed speech, recording medium etc. and combo of different models is pretty good.
[2024-04-07, 19:36:28] Soham (Composio.dev): I might have. Will get back on this.

[2024-04-07, 19:57:03] ~ ~I: no
it was transcribing interviews
so a lot filler words like umm etc. and both of them handled them very good

[2024-04-08, 13:14:16] Ruthvik Reddy: Isn't this a different way of saying RAG on search results? What does sources instead of links mean? Uploaded files?(This again a RAG on docs.)
[2024-04-08, 13:16:10] Ruthvik Reddy: Sound like models that are trained to make better sense of search API results and do a better RAG compared to more general LLMs, no? Even this is impressive. I was just wondering if they were doing something else altogether.

[2024-04-08, 19:40:50] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: While working on tddGPT, I experimented by starting multiple runs. It was a constrained agent with an clear end goal. Usually, one of the 10 runs used to be a golden run where the agent behaves exactly as expected.
[2024-04-08, 19:42:03] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: The big issue I ran into was inference speed. GPT4 Turbo is still quite slow. So each run used to last 30+ minutes. Experiment cycle times was just too long.

[2024-04-08, 21:04:54] C Chaitanya: Back in 2004, I guided one student to build a statistical model using cricinfo data. The good thing is cricinfo commentary is very clean with clear parts. We get type of ball bowled, shot played, bowler, batsman, current score, previous ball etc. Extracted all the matches played by India and then built a system to predict given the bowler, batsman and bowler, what is the most probable shot played. I think when we tested on a live match and predicted some 100 balls, we got an accuracy of around 78 or something. Fun times with just data crunching :)
[2024-04-08, 21:07:16] C Chaitanya: But now you can just feed chatGPT I guess:
Prompt:"Mustafizur to Shreyas Iyer,full ball wider outside off."

Has anyone tried this out?
[2024-04-09, 09:27:28] ~ ~I: yeah its very slow 
I did some basic benchmarking 
and it takes almost 10-15s for gpt4 which only takes 5-6s for gpt 3.5 turbo

can't also use streaming as its a WhatsApp bot

50k training runs! Is it usual scale of the number of iterations big labs put in for the models? 

More compute can easily lead to more experiments
[2024-04-09, 09:59:52] ~ Ayush Thakur: Yes gpt4 is comparatively slower. 

However if your application is making multiple LLM calls and if some of them can be parallelized, do it using Langchain Expression Language.

[2024-04-09, 10:29:26] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: How much latency do you get for first token. For me it is usually around 1.5 second which should be fine for most chatbots.
[2024-04-09, 10:31:02] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: Not a chatbot. And it's also not about latency for first token, there's a significant latency in subsequent tokens too. 

Streaming with 3.5 gives a smoother experience as opposed to 4
[2024-04-09, 10:31:28] ~ Atishay: 1.5 seconds is quite a lot for a real time experience. -Also for a text based bot e.g. WhatsApp the total latency is more important than ttft

[2024-04-09, 13:30:24] Nipun Jain: What do the webpages of future look like?
As agents become more common, humans won't go to a webpage and read it - the agent will read it for you and bring them to you (Perplexity, Arc Search)
Does it mean that webpages will be more optimized for agents and less for humans. Does the demand for tools like Webflow tanks?
Does life come full circle and the webpages of future look similar to the very first webpages - a plain text file?

[2024-04-09, 21:38:56] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: I am just curious what is the benefit of using SQL here - is it because model runs on the same machine where embeddings are stored or any other benefits?
[2024-04-09, 21:40:24] Ruthvik Reddy: How will the model give exact co-ordinates? Will this involve overlaying of labeled gridlines on the screenshots and asking gpt-4 vision for co-ordinates??
[2024-04-09, 21:42:23] ~ Santi: You can store your text, generate embeddings, index and retrieve on the database without any network hops to go fetch embeddings from an external service. In addition, you can also do keyword search along with semantic search. 
Experiments showed that doing everything on the DB is ~4x faster than a combination of a rest api service for embeddings on Huggingface and pinecone for retrieval.

[2024-04-10, 07:27:53] Nirant K: I mean, the long term trend of GPUs is to get cheaper and larger
[2024-04-10, 07:28:47] Nirant K: For instance, K80 was considered expensive in 2018 in lot of places — today, people can run lot larger models on their high end Macs
[2024-04-10, 07:29:03] Nirant K: The appetite for compute is practically infinite
[2024-04-10, 07:33:52] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I know I know.. these days, I'm not that excited about new (large) OSS model releases anymore. 
GPUs+models are like the real estate game. When the H100 will be at K80 price, the OSs model of those days will give 5tok/s on H100.

[2024-04-10, 23:39:53] Harsh Gupta Felvin: I think custom chips do make sense. NVIDIA’s margin is too high at 85%, they don’t fab the chips themselves, TSMC does. Custom chips make sense to both reduce cost and reduce dependency. Good thing for the industry, will force GPU costs to lower down. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-10, 23:41:01] Harsh Gupta Felvin: Also M1 is a good example of how custom chips can help with a tighter more vertically integrated system
[2024-04-10, 23:41:14] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Why? At meta’s scale for rec sys inference these chips make sense.
[2024-04-10, 23:49:34] Harsh Gupta Felvin: Actually this should make me short me on NVIDIA in medium term. It feels like NVIDIA doesn’t have much unique advantage in medium to long term.
[2024-04-10, 23:51:16] Priyank Agrawal: Their advantage is most common ML libs are built on top of CUDA architecture, so custom chips is ok but it makes the SDLC also longer for these companies
[2024-04-10, 23:58:39] Harsh Gupta Felvin: Have been hearing this argument, but don’t think CUDA moat is too strong. Most people libraries like PyTorch and Tensorflow, written by Meta and Google and don’t touch CUDA directly.
[2024-04-11, 00:56:42] Priyesh OnFinance: okay what will happen when the next gen of chips come out and more inference/$ is available, how will they phase out all this stuff? and when the new gen comes out, will they replace it with 3rd party or their own? Will there be a team working on this?
[2024-04-11, 01:03:23] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: This isn’t meta’s first chip. They have been doing this for a couple of years now. Serving recsys is where meta makes most of its money. I don’t see why they would not want to own the fullstack for it

[2024-04-11, 10:49:25] ~ Pankaj Chawla: Lack of control. I tried custom GPTs. U can create one in 30 mins, but that also means u have very little directional control on its usage in real use. In the hands of the user its very similar to what chatGPT would anyways do, so why switch between chatGPT and a customGPT (with additional effort of finding a good one).
[2024-04-11, 10:49:40] Rahul Sundar 2013: I would like to know about this too!
[2024-04-11, 10:50:42] Rahul Sundar 2013: Have you tested Retrieval based CustomGPTs/Agents?
[2024-04-11, 10:51:50] ~ Pankaj Chawla: On agents, I have a somewhat controversial view. As of now, I only see them as a way to get ppl to burn more tokens per problem. The fundamental challenges of the underlying LLM and having to control it via a language stay. We have had challenges where the agent just went on a token eating spree as it would not converge.
[2024-04-11, 10:53:40] Amit Bhor: Plug-ins : function calling success is ~70%. Most big brand usecases don't work at those levels.
[2024-04-11, 10:54:17] Rahul Sundar 2013: https://community.openai.com/t/assistant-api-retrieval-falls-short-of-identical-custom-gpt-retrieval/605275/2
[2024-04-11, 10:55:05] Priyank Agrawal: Tokens will be dirt cheap in future (if not already).

Think of them as KBs of internet data in 2000 vs 2024. Cost is negligible. Same will happen with toks over time.
[2024-04-11, 10:56:56] ~ Pankaj Chawla: We have tried problems that are essentially infinite loops. Agents were not able to reason themselves out of it. So in the hands of a novice user, u can have all ur vredits done for overnight. The same challenges that folks had with overblown AWS bills overnight.
[2024-04-11, 10:57:28] Amit Bhor: IMO, Agents without an environment for world play will suffer same fate.
[2024-04-11, 11:07:22] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: As Sholto Douglas says, agents suffer from the "nines of reliability" problem. The errors at each step add up and soon there's no way to recover from it.
[2024-04-11, 11:08:16] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Constrained agents is one way to address the problem. Identify and eliminate the error at each step.
[2024-04-11, 11:10:32] Paras Chopra Wingify: I also read somewhere that agents theoretically are useful where traditional deterministic tech doesn’t work, but that’s a one time problem to solve 

Once you solve it, you can build deterministic APIs to solve it for each subsequent time

So I guess figure is probably just retrieval of APIs or related UIs that user can herself interact with deterministically
[2024-04-11, 11:12:02] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: The best custom GPTs were the ones which were calling a proprietary function exposed by a company 
For example InVideo or Canva which exposed an API for function calling to create videos and images respectively 

Otherwise custom GPTs which were just setup with system prompt were no different than ChatGPT

So truly unique custom GPTs were very rare 

Also on top of it,$20 was a huge barrier for mass public to start using custom GPTs,even though I see many using free ChatGPT everyday.
[2024-04-11, 11:12:41] Paras Chopra Wingify: Imagine Apple providing a framework for apps to expose such Uis, so when I say order me a burger, an actual UI from Swiggy comes up instead of agent doing everything end to end 

(I’m not even sure if users want to do that)
[2024-04-11, 11:12:49] Paras Chopra Wingify: If the cost of failure is too high
[2024-04-11, 11:16:30] Rajesh Parikh Cynepia: We are still in motion, reward model, continuous learning and improvement loops will need to be part of every agent for it to be deterministic to the level of average human intelligence.   Nines of reliability that humans are able to deliver is not acheived in a single say, but by years of improvement.  Agents aren't immune to that continuous learning.
[2024-04-11, 11:19:03] ~ Pankaj Chawla: LLMs intrinsically are not very capable of doing both together. Finding error is somewhat easy but eliminating it can have side effects that lead to another error that it will now identify in the next step. Now imagine a cycle where error 1 leads to error 2 and fixing 2 leads to 1. These are the type of cases we recreated that agents without now having an external state/state machine will have difficulty solving.
[2024-04-11, 11:25:16] Rajesh Parikh Cynepia: Nine reliability assumes that generalized llms such as SOTA models like gpt4 can also perform tasks that need specialized skills to deliver required reliability.  This is inconsistent with the need of specialized tasks.  Going from generalized models to specialized task, by just grounding the prompt doesn't always work.
[2024-04-11, 11:26:25] Amit Bhor: In cases there is world play like SW dev
Error detection - errors, unit test 
Multiple cheap attempts at re-trying with feedback from environment
[2024-04-11, 11:27:23] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: That's exactly the approach I took with tddGPT
[2024-04-11, 11:27:46] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: https://github.com/gimlet-ai/tddGPT
[2024-04-11, 11:29:32] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: the issue i faced there was the the model was not able to fix the errors
[2024-04-11, 11:30:24] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: that step was error prone itself 😝
[2024-04-11, 11:32:18] Amit Bhor: Yeah, not easy to work with drunk intelligence. But there is a glimmer of hope it there is a feedback env
[2024-04-11, 11:35:47] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: It's probabaly because the training dataset does not have "npm test error -> code fixes" examples.
[2024-04-11, 11:36:59] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Even AIder is facing the same issue
[2024-04-11, 11:37:13] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: i think
[2024-04-11, 11:40:44] ~ Pankaj Chawla: Thats our conclusion:
PoC: Prompt engg
MVP: RAG/Agents
Production: Fine tune

Data is all u need 😁. And once u have data, compute is what u need next 🫡
[2024-04-11, 11:45:33] ~ Sandya Saravanan: Won't we need some kind of backtracking mechanism along with look ahead tree evaluation? This would be similar to AI game play like chess/go where board state changes by action and you want end state to be any error free including reported bug.. I would think we will need some kind of additional soup on top of just promoting based approaches.. maybe somewhat like alphageometry, where a fix is proposed by LLM, but you have a different module which verifies whether fix is correct

[2024-04-11, 15:08:47] C Chaitanya: I think this is proof that GPT wrappers don't work. You have to do a lot more stuff to build a business on top of APIs.
[2024-04-11, 15:20:49] Sumanth Raghavendra: GPT plug-ins were a great idea but OpenAI did a piss-poor job of packaging, marketing and managing it. The failure was little to do with technical/technological reasons...it is entirely about not thinking through the imperatives of a marketplace model (specifically enough demand at the top of the funnel, easy discoverability and incentives/tools for the creators)
[2024-04-11, 15:22:11] Pratyush Choudhury: Does this change with GPT5 coming in?
[2024-04-11, 15:23:02] Sumanth Raghavendra: doubt it...it was never about the quality of the model - just about the mindset and executive bandwidth needed to make something like this successful
[2024-04-11, 15:25:01] Pratyush Choudhury: I think it was actually tech capability that hindered this - there’s a reason Microsoft is holding off their CoPilot roll-out broad based
[2024-04-11, 15:29:19] Sumanth Raghavendra: Not sure why you think this is the case. 
We are speaking from personal experience. Here is one metric we saw for instance - we get 10k new users each day on the web purely through SEO/WOM (Google Search etc) - zero CAC. We published a very capable GPT (far more advanced than the simple hand-offs published by say Canva). Guess how many users we got? 150 over a month...so simply not enough folks at the top of the funnel. Whether we used GPT4/5/X would have made no difference...
[2024-04-11, 15:31:24] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I mean from their perspective they get the data on what works, so I don't know how bad it was from their perspective
[2024-04-11, 15:31:55] Sumanth Raghavendra: What data did they get?
[2024-04-11, 15:33:22] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: On a serious note, what marketplace use-cases  people are willing to pay for
[2024-04-11, 15:33:45] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: On a lighter note, that was the test ground for all things red teaming and prompt and data leakage 😂
[2024-04-11, 15:34:32] Sumanth Raghavendra: Nope, no way of knowing that either. Remember that there was no rev-share or even a monetization option. Forget all that, there was zero analytics - all you could see is the number of times your GPT was run... ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-11, 15:35:52] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: That's what you could see right ? That's not what Ilya saw I am sure 😂

[2024-04-11, 15:41:24] Vamshi: Since we’re in opinion mode-

I think a monolithic centralised AGI paradigm is a poor foundation for an ecosystem. 

Unless the idea is to make it the knowledge broker for all collaboration.

Interpretability and composability and decentralisation is more than just for human understanding as an end in itself. 

It’s a fundamental design requirement to create a work-able ecosystem of players/agents/organisations.

GPTs didn’t enable that. They tried to create specialisation from a larger AGI. Somehow this seemed backwards from the start.
[2024-04-11, 15:46:01] Sumanth Raghavendra: All these aspects are completely orthogonal to marketplace model success. How much AI/AGI does an Android or Apple marketplace have/require? OpenAI simply failed in nailing the biz aspects
[2024-04-11, 15:47:38] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I think the idea from the start was to create monolithic AGI and let it figure out how to save the world(distributed AI), because I think even OpenAI doesn't know anymore, but one can hope.
[2024-04-11, 15:47:39] Vamshi: They don’t have this problem because apps are not opaque. A GPT is not an app.
[2024-04-11, 15:48:06] Sumanth Raghavendra: Was Flappy bird an app?
[2024-04-11, 15:52:35] ~ Aj: ‎~ Aj left
[2024-04-11, 15:53:18] Vamshi: If I understand correctly you’re pointing out that there can be a successful marketplace for simple “apps” that don’t require composability to enable multiple players to collaborate ?

Still the underlying model (code in this case) supports it no?
[2024-04-11, 16:06:16] Vamshi: Perhaps that’s the road.

I think centralised intelligence has flaws that go way beyond governance and policy.

There are basic architectural flaws in something that is inevitably a platform / ecosystem to be both opaque and centralised.

Are “centralised intelligence” and “interpretable/composable intelligence” two different concerns?

I don’t have clear thoughts on that question, but they seem to be intertwined and central to ecosystem success.
[2024-04-11, 16:10:37] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yes definitely. 

If AI is given agency in policy, transparency  and interpratibility will 
become a concern 

Guess the question becomes, will AI have voting rights and how will the votes be interpreted?

Perhaps best discussed in philosophy group
[2024-04-11, 16:13:36] Vamshi: To clarify, my previous points were primarily about architecture and ecosystem, and not policy and governance.
[2024-04-11, 16:23:22] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Correlated I would say, if not causal
[2024-04-11, 16:35:45] Anil Chandra Naidu Matcha: You could keep a function and log analytics though

We have a database with around 600 tables and around 5 TB of data so it becomes difficult to supply everything as a tabular data
[2024-04-11, 20:19:47] Shan: I think the problem with agents is that they don’t learn or there’s no way to teach them.

How do I “teach” it to behave next time. Very hard.

[2024-04-12, 07:20:34] ~ Ajay: Folks who've used knowledge graphs with LLMs, what use cases have you seen the most improvement over RAG without KGs? Has anyone used it in legal or related area?
[2024-04-12, 07:39:58] ~ Avinash Tulasi: tl;dr: KG fits well with legal and related areas. Not so much in usecases with unstructured data. 

We did some planning around using KG, analysed our usecase, found that KG might be an overhead given the "temporal" and super unstructured nature of the data we have. The strong point of KG would be representing complex relations, ofcourse it requires using good graph building (eg: instagraph). 

Did a PoC on legal, in the usecase you mentioned for legal and related areas, KG will be particularly useful because, there will be appeal, counter appeal, say an appellant (their bio, s/o etc..), a small timeline of the case in question, some sections among others. Representing each case as a KG, any fact related to it can be fetched with high accuracy. An LLM also does a good job in fetching facts, but fetching will require multiple llm calls. Practically intermediate representation that your "workflow" keeps referring to should be robust and made one time, for efficiency and quality.
[2024-04-12, 07:44:01] ~ Ajay: What does "representing each case as a KG" mean? Each case is a node or you mean it's a collection of nodes/edges?
[2024-04-12, 07:44:25] ~ Ajay: How did you define the entities and relationships? Did you manually have to annotate them or because they were fairly structured well it was straightforward?
[2024-04-12, 07:50:21] ~ Avinash Tulasi: collection of nodes and edges. mixing cases doesn't make a lot of sense. unless we want to show ref of similar cases and the verdict. fetching similar cases can be done more efficiently with embedding matching or RAG or a similar technique.
[2024-04-12, 07:52:05] ~ Avinash Tulasi: Not manual annotation, do manual for one or a few cases, then you arrive at a cot prompt or few-shot on different "types" of entity relations.
[2024-04-12, 08:31:37] ~ Ajay: So you model each case as a graph. When a user query comes in, you do embedding ( or hybrid search ) on all content and then fetch not only the nodes that the top k content is part of but also it's neighbours? Or the entire connected graph it's a part of? How do you handle context exploding?
[2024-04-12, 08:33:24] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: What about the common preexisting knowledge base for cases? Common across all cases Acts etc? Anything on that ?
[2024-04-12, 08:47:14] ~ Avinash Tulasi: A RAG will be good for that. Store summaries, or tags that give a high level info. It's in the name knowledge base.
[2024-04-12, 08:49:28] ~ Avinash Tulasi: Think of it as working memory and long term memory. Specifics go into working memory or KG, summarised overview, or references go into long term KB (rag), because you will need them across different cases. 

Fetching is really a case to case challenge. You have to iterate and find.

LLM sherpa is a document parser which retains the hierarchical structure of the date that is extracted from the PDF.

Example : This parser retains this below hierarchical information structure

Title of the document [Main-Heading]
Overview [Sub-Heading]
   This is an overview of the process [Text Body]

We use this parser for a RAG application we are building.

This parser is having multiple errors but we still use this parser because of the following reasons :

1. Retains the Hierarchical structure of the data.
2. Does very good table extraction.
3. Retains the coordinates of the images which helps in extraction of images.
[2024-04-12, 11:05:15] Vetrivel PS: Friends need your help with the following :

Harry Potter is a fairly popular book,most of the training datasets for LLMs would have covered it in some form or the other.
[2024-04-12, 12:11:03] Rahul Sundar 2013: Isn't Llamaparse not capable of this?
[2024-04-12, 12:22:23] Sagar Sarkale Smallstep.ai: It sure is difficult to differentiate that. 

But the fact that it can map characters and their relationships means, we might be able to extend this to other unstructured data points to get graph like relationships seems exciting to me. 

E.g: given health records data one could map out disease- diagnosis-treatment patterns for a patient. 

We might be far from it but seems we will catch up.

[2024-04-17, 14:42:12] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Here is a TL;DR summary of the key points from the article:

- Yotta Data Services, a company backed by a real estate billionaire, has acquired 4,000 AI chips (GPUs) from Nvidia and plans to get 16,000 more by June to power its cloud services. 

- This is part of India's push for "sovereign AI" capabilities, with the government launching a $1.23 billion "India AI Mission".

- However, industry insiders are skeptical if there is enough AI-focused demand in India to justify Yotta's massive GPU order, which could cost up to $30,000 per chip.

- Yotta's aggressive move is seen as an attempt to capitalize on the hype around AI, but it faces competition from established players like E2E Networks as well as new entrants like Adani and Reliance.

- The article suggests Yotta may struggle to sell off all its GPUs quickly, and the chips' value could diminish as newer, more efficient models are launched by Nvidia.

- Overall, the article questions whether India is ready to fully unlock its AI potential and absorb the massive GPU investments being made by new players.

[2024-04-17, 14:47:37] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: I might be wrong but I think the reason is for any cloud company to be viable they have to sell of a certain percentage of their gpus in the first 12 to 14 months. so they assume there might be no buyers at scale(atleast in india)

[2024-04-18, 20:44:28] Harsh Gupta Felvin: Any benchmark on how doe they compare with Mistral, Claude and GPT models?
[2024-04-18, 20:45:50] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: The blog is not out yet. Some rumors on Reddit though.

[2024-04-18, 21:39:11] ~ prasanna kumar: Llama 3 models take data and scale to new heights. It’s been trained on our two recently announced custom-built 24K GPU clusters on over 15T token of data – a training dataset 7x larger than that used for Llama 2, including 4x more code. This results in the most capable Llama model yet, which supports a 8K context length that doubles the capacity of Llama 2.

Here's a poem in Kannada:

ಹುಳಿಸಿದ ಹೃದಯದ ಸುವಾಸನೆ
ನಮ್ಮ ಬೆಳೆಗೆ ಉರಿಯುತ್ತಿರುವ ಹಾವು

ನೀರು ಕೊರತೆಯಲ್ಲಿ ನಮ್ಮ ಪ್ರೇಮವಿಲ್ಲ
ಆಗ್ರಹದ ಮುಟ್ಟಿಗೆ ಬಂದಿತ್ತೆ ನಮ್ಮ ಆಶಾ

ಕಾಯರಾಜನ ಸುಂದರ ಮುಖ ನೋಡಿದೆ
ಗಾಂಧಿಯ ವಿಜ್ಞಾನ ನಮ್ಮ ಹೃದಯದಲ್ಲಿ

ನಮ್ಮ ಭಾಷೆ ಕನ್ನಡ ನೋಯಿಸುತ್ತಿರುವ ಪರಂಪರೆ
ನಮ್ಮ ಸಂಸ್ಕೃತಿ ಮಾಹಿತವೆ ನಮ್ಮ ಆಲಾಗೆ

- If you fine-tune Llama 3, you HAVE to include "Llama 3" at the beginning of the name of your release
- You are not allowed to train on outputs generated by Llama 3(and its fine-tunes) unless you are training Llama 3
[2024-04-18, 23:36:08] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: LLaMA3 is out! It's the same architecture as Llama-2, except for some differences:
1. 128K Tiktoken vocab vs 32K vocab of Llama-2
2. 15 Trillion tokens instead of 2T
3. 8 billion model uses GQA (unlike Llama 7b)
4. 8K Context Length
5. Chinchilla scaling laws - log linear gains!
6. 4x more code data

[2024-04-18, 23:47:20] Abhishek Mishra: tokenizer size boost for multilingual and some tool stuff and GQA on 8B are the only changes.
the only thing that makes a difference is 15T high quality data

[2024-04-18, 23:49:02] Abhishek Mishra: i mean the simplest thing - compute and data are making a difference, once we saturate performance with these, only then people will start caring out other improvements

[2024-04-19, 09:16:28] Vetrivel PS: *For LLaMA-3-8B/70B 95% of the technical info we have so far is related to data quality:*

- 15T tokens of pretraining data
- More code during pretraining (leads to better reasoning capabilities)
- More efficient tokenizer with larger vocabulary
- Super sophisticated (including LLM components) data quality filtering
- Extensive empirical analysis of data mixture
- Focus on quality filtering of post training data (for SFT/RLHF/DPO)

Cool podcast I found clearing some air. Some key points/summary

1. Dr. Vishnu Vardhan, founder and CEO of Vizy and SML, is creating Hanooman - an ecosystem of foundational AI models for India, built from scratch for different Indian languages. 

2. Hanooman is currently 372 billion parameters and over 2 trillion tokens in size. It will work with audio, text, images and videos. The public beta version is launching on May 1st.

3. Around $300 million in funding is needed to scale up Hanooman. SML, the creator company of Hanooman, is in talks with investors, mostly wealth funds, to raise this capital. 

4. Vishnu believes Indian VCs lack the willingness to invest in deep tech AI. VCs want to see monetization first before putting in large sums, whereas building foundational models requires significant upfront investment.

5. SML has a strategic partnership with US-based AI fund 3AI. This is helping launch the B2C offering of Hanooman by sharing technology, research and potentially funding.

6. The Hanooman model will be free for educational use. A subscription model will be introduced later at an affordable price for Indians. Enterprise offerings will also monetize the platform.

7. Research collaboration with institutions like IIT has been key in developing Hanooman, especially for creating the Indic language datasets by leveraging similarities between language families.

8. SML is hiring top engineering talent from IITs, other colleges and even school students who demonstrate exceptional AI/coding skills, to build the Hanooman ecosystem. 

9. The end goal for Hanooman is to enable India to produce cutting-edge AI research that drives the field forward, potentially up to AGI, rather than just downstream applications.

10. Hanooman aims to open up the generative AI ecosystem in India, enabling startups to build products on top of the foundational models. But significant funding is required to realize this potential.

[2024-04-19, 17:55:57] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Having more Devnagri tokens in the vocab and in the training data as well
[2024-04-19, 18:01:21] Sankalp Shubham: i meant are there any other famous tokenizers which already have more indic language script tokens
[2024-04-19, 18:02:58] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Oh the gemma tokenizer(256k vocab size) has a really good support for all indic language script tokens
[2024-04-19, 18:03:07] Sankalp Shubham: pretraining on 15T tokens should mean it should perform well at hindi too as you know it's next token prediction essentially ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-19, 18:04:17] Sankalp Shubham: > "Over 5% of the Llama 3 pretraining dataset consists of high-quality non-English data that covers over 30 languages. "
[2024-04-19, 18:04:49] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: llama3 is going bonkers in Hindi after finetuning with just english dataset. 😂
[2024-04-19, 18:05:26] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I guess I will wait for Sarvam to release their model to attempt multilingual finetuning
[2024-04-19, 18:05:54] Sankalp Shubham: won't that require a lot of data, i mean you can't beat the pretraining
[2024-04-19, 18:06:59] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Only Sarvam can do continual pretraining for Indic languages, and I won't trust anyone either. Just being honest.
[2024-04-19, 18:07:36] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Are you saying you don't trust krutrim 😜
[2024-04-19, 18:09:58] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I can't use their model to finetune as it is not open. Sarvam has legends who worked on Indic languages before. GPU poors have to make calculated decisions for whatever small amount of resources they have. 2x3090s in my case. 😂 ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-19, 18:14:08] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: btw reasoning in llama3 after finetuning has improved a lot. Still have so many things to figure out, it started showing code with Class AgricultureCotton: for an Agri question 😂. I will wait for @919616406460 to educated with some Gyan after he is done doing his experiments.
[2024-04-19, 18:18:20] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Can think of it like this but correct me if I'm wrong @919148574393 

Llama 3 training set was 15T tokens. 5% of it is non english tokens so that's 750000000000 tokens

Now these 750 Billion tokens were spread across 30 languages and considering an equal distribution over all 30 languages it comes out to be 25000000000 ie. 25 Billion tokens per non english language. Chinchilla optimal is 160 Billion tokens for an 8B model. And a language like Hindi is very rich so I feel it's grossly underrepresented. I might be wrong as well but😛

[2024-04-19, 19:53:10] ~ Rohan: Poe introduces the ability to chat with multiple LLMs in a single chat, simply by @-mentioning the bot: https://qr.ae/ps40kJ

How might they have done this? If you're chatting with GPT-4, and then decide to @-mention Claude Opus, how can you pass the entire context of the chat with GPT so far efficiently to Claude? A naive way would be to share the entirety of the chat so far to the new bot being called, but that could get prohibitively expensive for long chats.
[2024-04-19, 19:54:49] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Passing chat history is regardless same for any model.

[2024-04-19, 20:00:19] Prof. Srijan Kumar: We have built a framework to create a fine tuned RAG model, which is much more accurate and hallucinates much less than using off-the-shelf rag implementation from llamaindex or langchain.

[2024-04-20, 21:10:19] Adithya S K PESIT: I havnt explored qwen much but heard its a really good model but on a high level overview any thoughts on why it performs that good
[2024-04-20, 21:24:24] Sankalp Shubham: firstly its 110B lol
[2024-04-20, 21:44:17] Adithya S K PESIT: any open source good image datasets to train diffusion models?
[2024-04-20, 23:00:54] Paras Chopra Wingify: I’m curious if anyone has good intuition on MLP layers in transformers

I was watching 3blue1brown and have a good intuition on what self attention is doing, but why do we need MLP? What’s it doing there?
[2024-04-20, 23:02:22] Paras Chopra Wingify: It’s telling that 2/3rds of all parameters are in MLPs, so I’ve heard that that’s where “memory” Is stored and hence MLPs are what enables the network to remember facts that The capital of France is Paris
[2024-04-20, 23:02:41] Paras Chopra Wingify: But the intuition isn’t clear on how it enables that
[2024-04-20, 23:10:44] Sankalp Shubham: purpose of MLPs in general is to do a linear transformation + activation function to introduce more non linearity. this allows to model more complex things.

you will find it pretty much after every exotic operation in various models.
[2024-04-20, 23:13:24] Sankalp Shubham: so like some things cannot be expressed with x amount of parameters. 

so you project them into a higher dimension and then approximate them. 

u can think of MLPs doing that - linear transformation + activation function
[2024-04-20, 23:13:33] Avijit Thawani: Highly recommend the Mor Geva papers on “ffn as key value memories” and follow up work
[2024-04-20, 23:14:13] Avijit Thawani: Happy to discuss more, I’ve drafted papers on this and read a lot.
[2024-04-20, 23:14:21] Tejas Referred By paras: This MLP adds complexity to the model by enabling individual transformations on each element of the sequence. It essentially processes the information from the previous Multi-Head Attention step, for the next attention block.
[2024-04-20, 23:19:09] Paras Chopra Wingify: Yeah I know it processes output from multi head attention but what exactly is it adding to the residual stream
[2024-04-20, 23:19:33] Sankalp Shubham: you can think of self-attention as recalibrating representation of input data by adding the attention weights - what is more relevant for what.

but its still a linear transformation. its not feedforward.

you need an MLP (with its hidden layer and activation function that introduces non linearity) to capture the new info. (feedforward) ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-20, 23:21:39] Paras Chopra Wingify: https://arxiv.org/abs/2012.14913
[2024-04-20, 23:23:19] Paras Chopra Wingify: In theory, don’t you just need last layer MLP to predict logits
[2024-04-20, 23:24:06] Paras Chopra Wingify: if sequence is “the cat say on the”

Then embedding for last “the” could contain sufficient context  from attention that you just need to project it to final logits
[2024-04-20, 23:26:09] Avijit Thawani: Yes but you could add a lot more context from “memory” by retrieving what cat really means, what sat means, and what they mean in this context etc
[2024-04-20, 23:27:56] Avijit Thawani: An important follow up: https://arxiv.org/abs/2203.14680
[2024-04-20, 23:29:07] Jaskaran Dubverse: This makes sense.
But doesn't this make the model shallow. The simplest way to induce enough complexity in the model is to add mlp so that model does not have high bias
[2024-04-20, 23:30:13] Paras Chopra Wingify: So is it fair to say this

Self attention adds nuances to what the word means in context of input sequence 

MLP increasingly refines what should be the next word, given the nuances meaning?
[2024-04-20, 23:34:42] Avijit Thawani: Yes
[2024-04-20, 23:37:33] Tejas Referred By paras: Without many MLPs or with very few MLPs, you will not achieve enough non-linear transformations, limiting you to less complex solutions. Your network needs to learn complex transformations.

If you only have a nonlinear function at the end, your representation resulting from the combination of linear transformations will be a single linear transformation. Therefore, ideally, you need non-linearity after each linear transformation ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-20, 23:37:35] Sankalp Shubham: u may study about skip connections in resnet. 

idea is to add inputs of early layers directly to outputs of (self-attention + mlp)block to retain more information otherwise when models grt really deep, u tend to lose info. vanishing gradients problem
[2024-04-20, 23:39:14] Avijit Thawani: Wait what about the nonlinear activations in SA itself?
[2024-04-20, 23:40:27] Jaskaran Dubverse: Thats used for normalization

[2024-04-22, 09:09:18] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: We build on open source, you definitely need pre-generation grounding if you want to give out information. Open source gets you to a decent start from a moderation standpoint.

[2024-04-22, 09:18:26] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Which is the open-source safety guardrails ?
[2024-04-22, 09:34:51] ~ Amit Sharma: Guardrails, imo, is like the last mile and works well when reasonably customized. If you have a strong intuition around what is needed in a particular industry vertical, it will be great to build 80% of it and have infra/product/people to configure the last 20%. Many of the GenAI 'implementation' teams inside enterprises are working on building appropriate guardrails for their BUs/companies.
[2024-04-22, 09:44:35] ~ Amit Sharma: Here is one example: https://github.com/guardrails-ai
[2024-04-22, 09:46:01] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: This is not for safety. But more for formatting and validators
[2024-04-22, 09:46:16] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: I asked specifically for safety
[2024-04-22, 10:12:34] Nirant K: What's safety?

[2024-04-22, 10:22:10] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: alignment  stuff. so a chatbot doesnt tell someone to go and kill themself. llms are aligned..but in most cases for compliance, deployments need a separate "judge" for safety
[2024-04-22, 10:23:42] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: india context is actually very relevant here. most alignment datasets dont take "caste" into account - because that is so india specific. so caste comments are not considered unsafe from a LLM standpoint.
so u need safety guardrails in india. P.S. this is precisely what krutrim's USP is btw.
[2024-04-22, 10:28:18] ~ Bharath: Great point.
[2024-04-22, 10:50:56] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: What kind of infrastructure?
[2024-04-22, 10:51:34] Digvijay GenAI Group: As someone fighting this battle for a few months , my understanding is :

Alignment = upstream safety 
Guardrailing = downstream safety
[2024-04-22, 10:51:57] Digvijay GenAI Group: & so far it seems neither is complete without the other one ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-22, 10:55:59] Prashanth Harshangi Encrypt AI: Eloquently put. `Safety` before deployment and post deployment needs to be differentiated and have to go hand-in hand. Knowing the gaps - do a DPO/ORPO fine tuning and then run-time guardrails for further customization when deployed.

[2024-04-22, 11:17:39] ~ Amit Sharma: Its a little bit like detecting 'hate speech' in social/mainstream media. Very subjective & nuanced beyond the obvious.

[2024-04-22, 11:46:14] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: lots of things - but even i dont have all the answers. politics is a BIG one in india. and everyone is shit scared about it. can u say things like "according to indian govt rules, we are denying your request" and then subsequent questions around that topic which could end up in politically colored notes.

[2024-04-22, 13:00:19] Digvijay GenAI Group: Sure there are going to be localised narratives (like Kaveri water, elections) that will keep on changing with time.
[2024-04-22, 13:00:47] Digvijay GenAI Group: However, large part of digital content Safety be it from UGC or Gen AI will be dictated by regulations.

[2024-04-23, 09:14:23] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: 3.8B parameters models rival GPT3.5. This is amazing as a quantized version of it can run on mobile devices natively.
[2024-04-23, 09:46:29] C Chaitanya: Are they really that good or its benchmark corruption?
[2024-04-23, 09:48:00] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: slightly felt the benchmarks were gamed tbh

[2024-04-23, 12:04:40] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Should add Sophia Yang (Head of Developer Relations @ Mistral AI) is the instructor
[2024-04-23, 12:28:21] Rahul Deora: Looks fake and unbelievable, maybe gamed somehow. Hard to believe it could out do Opus
[2024-04-23, 12:42:31] Nirant K: deeplearning.ai signal has stopped meaning anything tbh, you're better off reading docs in almost all courses now
[2024-04-23, 12:43:12] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Signal for what exactly ?
[2024-04-23, 12:43:45] Nirant K: quality
[2024-04-23, 12:44:08] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Interesting. Why do you say that ? Seems decent for a beginner tutorial
[2024-04-23, 12:45:22] Nirant K: Unless you've some challenges (e.g. ADHD) which prevents you from reading docs and cookbooks, it's more time efficient to read docs than these courses which are often just wrong
[2024-04-23, 12:45:43] Nirant K: And they're wrong in ways it's not worth talking about in public about
[2024-04-23, 12:45:55] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Interesting. How does ADHD relate to docs vs video ?
[2024-04-23, 12:46:01] Nirant K: E.g. Mistral Embeddings are pure unadulterated garbage, is the Mistral DevRel going to say that?

[2024-04-23, 12:48:44] ~ Abhishek Karmakar: Hello wonderful group, 
Are there any lightweight semantic search models which can give a relevance score between two documents?
Something which is light on compute and storage.
[2024-04-23, 12:48:55] ~ ~I: the course seems to be only their models and not embeddings
also, would you say there's problem with deeplearning.ai courses in general or this one specifically?
[2024-04-23, 12:50:10] ~ ~I: i used elasticsearch (i assume you want to self host)
[2024-04-23, 12:50:40] ~ Abhishek Karmakar: yes.
[2024-04-23, 12:51:50] Nirant K: I maintain FastEmbed (dedicated fast, light embedding lib) — the new Arctic XS and S models are fantastic and both better than OpenAI. Throw into a vector store of choice, and you'll do 10-40% better than Elastic depending on the dataset

[2024-04-23, 14:15:21] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Has anyone deployed LangChain in production recently? Was there any issue in latest package ?

The documentation on website is unhelpful 

I’m getting a lot of errors while using the latest package for vector stores ,and most of the errors are getting resolved by using LangChain-community package.
[2024-04-23, 14:28:19] Abhishek Mishra: lmsys arena is basic tasks + human preference (answering style)
[2024-04-23, 14:29:11] Abhishek Mishra: so all rankings there reflect how humans would like a model and make do with basic requests. advanced use cases are to be tested with specific evals.
[2024-04-23, 14:30:00] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Lmsys is now preferred eval. Ignore anything else.
[2024-04-23, 14:30:52] ~ Ashish Singhal: I would avoid deploying langchain in production. Langchain package is still evolving, I think a few months back they also made major changes. 
There are security concerns too.

Can you develop without langchain in the production? In the end it's only a wrapper.
[2024-04-23, 14:36:10] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: The security concern is the exact reason I had doubt on packages.

There seems to be no choice but to develop without LangChain in this case.
[2024-04-23, 15:58:51] Nirant K: Might as well avoid OpenAI latest models too, some of them are newer than langchain and it's not even OSS
[2024-04-23, 15:59:25] ~ Atishay: What is the security concern with langchain?
[2024-04-23, 16:04:17] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Not a security concern as such,but official package has some issues which they haven’t addressed for months

After a lot of digging I found that community package has correct implementations which are not present in official ones

Concern is don’t know where to use what until something breaks for production and getting clearance to use these community packages internally.
[2024-04-23, 18:03:39] Shan: https://www.sbert.net/docs/usage/semantic_textual_similarity.html might be a good start imo
[2024-04-23, 19:08:52] ~ Apurva Bhatt: Does anyone know any good visualization tools for overviewing Pytorch model training?

I am training a model and I want to see which of the model attributes are moving in which direction, magnitude, etc. Some of the attributes are 
1. gradient at each layer at each epoch.
2. change in weight at layer at each epoch. average magnitude and direction.
etc.

[2024-04-23, 20:22:22] ~ Bharath: Has anyone tried installing an LLM on their Android device?
[2024-04-23, 20:27:13] ~ Ashish Singhal: You can try XAI for this? I really don't know what you want to achieve.

If the model is in PyTorch then can use Captum package for XAI. Tensorflow also would have some package

[2024-04-24, 07:17:33] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Hey this is true, at some point you become too big to act fast.

But I do feel like multiple models should not be a part of the user experience... the only metric should be are you helping users or not, multiple models makes it feel like a prototyping tool rather than an end solution
[2024-04-24, 07:18:28] Atik Shaikh: It was just an example 😅
[2024-04-24, 07:18:28] Shankar Natarajan: I honestly did not find much value out of perplexity and they seem to be a glorified RAG with data coming from Bing. What’s their value add apart from answer based UX. Just thinking aloud
[2024-04-24, 07:18:41] Atik Shaikh: Just join the discord you will see a lot more
[2024-04-24, 07:18:55] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Ya Atik I get that :)
[2024-04-24, 07:18:55] Atik Shaikh: They just acknowledge that its on the roadmap and never actually implement it
[2024-04-24, 07:19:30] Atik Shaikh: We have requested a public roadmap/ changelogs but I don’t think they’re interested in revealing that yet.
[2024-04-24, 07:20:03] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Bing? I thought Google but I'm not even sure of that. I read somewhere that they try to index only trusted links, resulting in a much smaller web index than Google/Bing
[2024-04-24, 07:20:47] Atik Shaikh: What is your usage like when using an AI tool ? If its completely about researching and getting the updated info from web sources then Perplexity still comes in top 3 tools at any day ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-04-24, 07:25:16] Atik Shaikh: Thats the topmost feature I use from it 🚀
[2024-04-24, 07:25:49] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: 😂 yeah is this confirmed that they are using the Google search index? 

Anyway @918763968157 also mentioned dthay it's likely that both will co-exist
[2024-04-24, 07:26:47] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: But gotta love how democratised tech is in the gen AI era, opens up so many possibilities ❤️
[2024-04-24, 07:27:08] Atik Shaikh: As far as I know from Aravinds interviews he always told that they have a custom index which updates frequently so I am not sure that they’re completely using google apis
[2024-04-24, 07:27:14] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Oh damn this is awesome, I had no idea
[2024-04-24, 07:27:30] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Exactly, no clear info on this
[2024-04-24, 07:27:37] Atik Shaikh: Yeah man I really feel I am living in an age where information is so easily accessible and distributable
[2024-04-24, 07:27:51] Shankar Natarajan: Sure but my pt is there is no durable value here. Tomo Bing chat can replicate it . The Bing and google index are something u can’t build
Over night. Maybe perplexity is only a highly paid experiment for VCs to learn about user behaviour with AI driven search
[2024-04-24, 07:27:59] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Big tech is no more untouchable :)
[2024-04-24, 07:28:18] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: But they haven't yet, we should talk about this when they do
[2024-04-24, 07:28:24] Pratyush Choudhury: There’s a lot that goes behind this ‘wrapping’ :)

We don’t call a SnapChat an AWS wrapper do we?

Netflix, Disney+ and Prime all use AWS under the hood - all ‘wrappers’ of AWS but all have very different experiences
[2024-04-24, 07:28:32] Atik Shaikh: Perplexity UI > Bing UI
[2024-04-24, 07:28:53] Atik Shaikh: I can give you 10 bugs rn in the Bing Chat UI xd
[2024-04-24, 07:29:08] Atik Shaikh: 💯
[2024-04-24, 07:29:20] Shankar Natarajan: Yes but Ui is not hard to replicate. Is UI their core value add ? Lol
[2024-04-24, 07:31:35] Atik Shaikh: I never said it isnt, also never mentioned its their core value. Its just the thing I find interesting about a product ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-24, 07:31:44] Shankar Natarajan: Well, AWS does not source the data in Netflix . Here with Bing APIs data comes from them. I know folks maybe fans of perplexity, I am honestly trying to learn what’s their core value prop apart from presenting the content in a more consumable and accessible form which can be really replicated.
[2024-04-24, 07:31:57] Atik Shaikh: If its not hard to replicate, maybe you have found your next product to build 😂
[2024-04-24, 07:34:41] Shankar Natarajan: I meant for Bing :-) which MsFt has ambition to go deep . https://telecom.economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/internet/microsoft-hires-google-deepmind-cofounder-mustafa-suleyman-to-run-its-consumer-ai/108632344
[2024-04-24, 07:36:20] Atik Shaikh: Yeah this is promising ngl
[2024-04-24, 07:37:28] Atik Shaikh: Also just wanted to add more to your point. There is a Chinese website which had smartly decided to integrate the best of both worlds from Perplexity and Phind. Have you guys have tried it ? I shared it a month ago on this group

https://devv.ai
[2024-04-24, 07:44:04] Nirant K: I've. Not a strong proponent anymore. Easier to throw a LLM at every problem and launch
[2024-04-24, 07:55:01] Pratyush Choudhury: It’s a very long answer to type but briefly, I wrote something last night about differences in wrapping GPT (LLM) vs AWS (infra)

Can share it here vs DMs if that’s interesting - that’s different this time

The second part of the answer is that I look at search as index, ranking and retrieval - if you apply LLMs to the whole mix, they do a phenomenal job when it comes to parsing the information in 10 blue links

Put another way, if I know what the top 10 blue links are but don’t know of their ranking mechanism, I can use an LLM to better present this information to the end user and this actually is a new innovation which would buy you a long rope to get you to build your own indexing and other backends over time
[2024-04-24, 07:59:17] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Building on incumbents and de risking components by privatising it is a safe path. But de risking is pretty much a ground up approach and it's still risky 😅
[2024-04-24, 08:02:06] Pratyush Choudhury: The incumbent in question here is THE incumbent that’s never been challenged on their own turf

How else would you take on them?
[2024-04-24, 08:04:35] Shankar Natarajan: If perplexity goes full stack and use LLm in full stack from crawling to ingestion to indexing to ranking to serving to Ux . Today they are only in UX and partly in serving. Google and Bing are not going to sit tight they will be thinking about using LLm and revamping their whole search stack and experience ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-24, 08:09:44] Pratyush Choudhury: What Perplexity is doing is usually how most startups approach initially as they’ll never have the kind of scale and resources as the incumbents

How incumbents react is usually hard to gauge upfront but in this case, they haven’t been able to do much - probably because both Bing and Google have huge profit pools to protect first
[2024-04-24, 08:13:15] Shankar Natarajan: I feel like the bamboo tree the incumbents are first growing roots and you will see shoots soon. In 2000s yes profit was good enough now there is a lot of stock market pressure to show value and incumbent are not going yo sit tight imho
[2024-04-24, 08:15:24] Pratyush Choudhury: Problem is that stock market pressure only :)

Imagine reporting 0.5% gross margin  drop as such a large public company
‎[2024-04-24, 08:20:54] Shankar Natarajan: ‎image omitted
[2024-04-24, 08:21:38] Pratyush Choudhury: Overall margins
[2024-04-24, 08:22:51] Shankar Natarajan: Should not impact in short term much imo. If it’s capex margins should not be impacted .
[2024-04-24, 08:23:30] Pratyush Choudhury: Already is - an LLM search result doesn’t have a business model outside of pure subscriptions
[2024-04-24, 08:24:58] Shankar Natarajan: API subscriptions, per user licensing of 30 usd per month per user . Are two main ways to make money . I don’t think the problem is investment and intent it is about finding the right strategy and execution and iteration at speed
[2024-04-24, 08:25:34] Pratyush Choudhury: This business model is <<< what Google has today

[2024-04-24, 09:38:03] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: Yes, I agree. I was thinking for classification problems, it could be an efficient way to distill knowledge into. Could serve the same feature with less latency and cost possibly.. I’m not too sure of actual real world performance though. When I trained it on some tougher tasks it isn’t doing so well.
[2024-04-24, 10:01:29] Nirant K: The LLMs knows the 2nd time that it's being tested for hallucination

[2024-04-24, 10:23:11] Harsh Gupta Felvin: Did you inspect that the prompt from RAG is being injected properly in the first time? It is possible that the RAG part isn't being initialized properly due to cache mismatch or something else.
[2024-04-24, 10:24:07] Harsh Gupta Felvin: It it is always that first you get wrong result and everyother time you get right result, llm is unlikely to be at fault here.

[2024-04-24, 22:23:28] Bharat Kumar Ramesh Hashmal Web3: This is great. But tbh, this press release is a little underwhelming

It seems largely focused on administrative and management use cases

No mention of usecases like new molecule discovery, research into protein folding, etc

I am planning to do a startup in Ai coach/therapist sector.

The timing seems right to try a fundamentally different approach as compared to journaling, mindfulness and meditation apps 
plus I am personally very attached to the field

Companies like inflection ( https://pi.ai/discover ), hume https://www.hume.ai/ are showing what is possible with the general technology.

If you work on LLMs and are interested in starting up, we can have a chat/call.

[2024-04-25, 16:14:51] Ruthvik Reddy: But, the Azure OpenAI’s mandatory image moderation is making vision models unusable for our use-case [Involves screenshots of our user sites and even normal sites are getting flagged]. One will need an Azure account with a dedicated account manager to be considered for completely removing content moderation.
[2024-04-25, 17:11:15] Rajaswa Patil: Even that is a huge legal headache. They ask for significant documentation which essentially should translate to “We take the legal responsibility for the outputs of Azure OpenAI models”
[2024-04-25, 17:12:11] Rajaswa Patil: They do have content moderation configurability under preview though. One can try and get into that early access program as a partner I guess.

[2024-04-25, 21:43:45] ~ pupa: Was looking for exactly this some days back. Seems like they did not release any official implementation for Claude3. There are some unofficial unoptimized ones though (haven't tried it yet): https://github.com/javirandor/anthropic-tokenizer
[2024-04-25, 21:56:18] ~ Nj: Has anyone experimented with LLM Lingua? The compressed prompts it generates in the examples seem to be pretty bad, I don't see it resulting in "minimal performance loss".

A new tool created by Cleanlab, an AI startup spun out of a quantum computing lab at MIT, is designed to give high-stakes users a clearer sense of how trustworthy these models really are. it gives any output generated by a large language model a score between 0 and 1, according to its reliability. This lets people choose which responses to trust and which to throw out.. 

Here is the playground to try it: https://tlm.cleanlab.ai

[2024-04-26, 07:13:25] Shan: Reminds me of this quote 

“What does a scanner see? Into the head? Down into the heart? Does it see into me? Into us? Clearly or darkly? I hope it sees clearly because I can't any longer see into myself. I see only murk. I hope for everyone's sake the scanners do better, because if the scanner sees only darkly the way I do, then I'm cursed and cursed again.” -A Scanner Darkly (Phil K Dick)
[2024-04-26, 08:57:33] ~ Ashish Singhal: Does anyone have any idea how trustworthiness score has been arrived at here??

 Or any wild guesses
[2024-04-26, 08:58:55] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: I have a question, how are people dealing with cases where expected output from openai is greater than context length -4k. In chatgpt there is an option that come to continue generation. Is something like this possible for the APi

[2024-04-26, 18:03:35] Lavish 2017: don't know any direct solution for this.

last year, what I did to solve this was switch the model to 3.5-16K when output token count > 3900 and re-load response for user. I was not doing streaming so was easier to reload response.
[2024-04-26, 18:28:37] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: Would gpt3.5 give full response, I have seen gpt4 giving shorter responses then 4k even though ideally the output should have been longer

[2024-04-26, 18:43:21] ~ Manasi: I’m wondering if there is a better way than simply doing this via a prompt? Esp for longer documents
[2024-04-26, 19:04:15] Lavish 2017: yes worked for me. just ensure max_tokens is set to maximum when you're getting shorter responses where you're expecting detailed and do prompt iterations?
[2024-04-26, 19:04:30] Priyesh OnFinance: Okay so do you have an ontology extraction step
[2024-04-26, 19:09:16] Priyesh OnFinance: If not I can share some github gists once I get to office in a couple hours.

[2024-04-26, 20:06:14] Nithin Vasishta IIT B MILA: This was a nice read: https://www.anthropic.com/research/probes-catch-sleeper-agents

At least for the sleeper agent models developed by Anthropic, linear detectors trained using simple datasets (not using any model information or the nature of deflection) can identify if a given prompt would lead to model deflecting. The middle layers of the model are more likely to give away this information.

There are a lot of tables with a lot of columns, and after adding everything in the prompt, the size is about ~2.5-3k tokens. Even after doing everything, the LLM sometimes hallucinates column names and very regularly mistakes SQL operators with KQL. 
Any idea how to resolve this?

[2024-04-27, 09:30:51] C Chaitanya: People, as I had mentioned before, Swecha team is planning a huge data collection program as an Internship. We are starting with the Telugu language. After the success of the Telugu ASR project, the goal is to now scale this up. We are calling it the Shatasahasra yagnam, loosely translated to 1 lakh mission. 1 lakh interns, will go to different corners of the two Telugu states and collect more than 1 billion sentences of Telugu. We have already built a data collection app.
Goal is to create following datasets:
1. LLM
2. ASR
3. TTS
4. Multimodal
5. Video captioning
6. Handwriting.
If you have any ideas for any specific datasets, please suggest. Would like collate before we start this yagnam so that we don't duplicate effort.
[2024-04-27, 09:58:06] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Can you the links for the current Telugu ASR model you trained and dataset that was collected?
[2024-04-27, 10:01:50] C Chaitanya: Will host it next week. There has been a delay in getting the license finalized. Working with SFLC lawyers to see how we can update open source licenses so that attribution is there even when fine tuning etc. Also, discussing what kind of license is best for open source datasets. Should we have a license which makes people open up their datasets also if they use this dataset or should be free for all etc.
[2024-04-27, 10:06:38] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Swecha is non-profit, just do it Apache.
[2024-04-27, 10:07:32] C Chaitanya: Leaning towards that only.
[2024-04-27, 10:11:36] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: If you update/modify standard open source license then it’s not the same license and then it lose all the OSS incentive. If your data is useful, people will attribute. There are many really huge initiatives that has been open sourced under Apache. What’s the size dataset that you have currently? ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-27, 10:11:48] C Chaitanya: But there is a discussion happening on how the current licenses help the incumbents. The data will be released and pretty much the biggest gainers will be the cloud providers who can use the data and add their own data and fine tune. How can we help smaller startups? Should we do a GPL license so that if this dataset is used as part of a larger dataset, that dataset also has to be open sourced? Then the acceptance might be lower. Maybe this discussion is for the philosophy group :)
[2024-04-27, 10:12:24] C Chaitanya: Its around 1.5 million sentences recorded.
[2024-04-27, 10:13:27] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Anyone can just train on your dataset without inserting into their. It doesn’t work that way.
[2024-04-27, 10:14:13] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: ~400-500 hours?
[2024-04-27, 10:14:30] C Chaitanya: I think around 1100 hours
[2024-04-27, 10:17:37] C Chaitanya: The problem is, we have done these efforts before also. Somehow the big guys get all the benefits without attribution. For example, I know that a team had collected more than 2000 hours of high quality Telugu data which was supposed to have been released in open source. MSFT I think funded the project. MSFT got the data, but the data has not been open sourced. It might be one of the reason Azure Telugu is one of the better services. So this time Swecha decided to create the dataset without funds from anyone so they can release the dataset on their terms.
[2024-04-27, 10:18:05] C Chaitanya: This project was done in 2018-2019 if I remember correctly
[2024-04-27, 10:18:06] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I think it’s not that big to have bargaining power, if you real want to help the Telugu language. For next larger project, you can work with lawyers for custom license.
[2024-04-27, 10:19:02] C Chaitanya: Of course. Teams like Swecha don't have bargaining power for sure :)
Its more to just set a path and let society decide the best way forward.
[2024-04-27, 10:19:03] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: A lot of data came from Ai4bharat was funded by MS research. MS research has the largest monetary contribution to where Indic language ASR, TTS and translation are today ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-27, 10:20:24] C Chaitanya: For sure.
[2024-04-27, 10:20:42] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: ‎This message was deleted.
[2024-04-27, 10:31:54] C Chaitanya: But I think it's a symbiotic relationship. MS has also got lots of data and research access which has helped them improve their models. I would say for Indian languages, Azure has the best outputs
[2024-04-27, 10:36:52] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: Do you really need 2000 hours to train a good ASR model? We were able to train with a couple of hours on wav2vec
[2024-04-27, 10:38:03] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: Adding some noise, and adversarial perturbation made models pretty robust
[2024-04-27, 10:39:04] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: 2000 hours would be great to even train a small ASR model with CTC from scratch.
[2024-04-27, 10:43:42] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: If the initiative is this big, the objective should be collecting and labeling many dialects of a language, not just a language, which may then need mode data.
[2024-04-27, 10:44:37] C Chaitanya: This is goal. Model size should be small enough to fit in a mobile
[2024-04-27, 11:31:04] Shan: The spirit of open source is that it’s open. Whether big tech uses it or startups is immaterial.
[2024-04-27, 11:34:52] C Chaitanya: Agreed. Thats why trying to find the right license. There is the spirit of GPLV3, there is the spirit of Apache and then there is the spirit of MIT. Each have their purposes. But each were created with software in mind. The concepts of finetuning or dataset training was not thought of. So have asked the lawyers to think of those too.
[2024-04-27, 11:36:19] Neeraj Kumar: I am doing research on code copilots/assistants?

[2024-04-28, 10:36:42] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: Also there is a ton of research now available for building end to end speech models. It’s not like the old era of Kaldi and hybrid models which required a lot of clean audio to train models.
[2024-04-28, 10:37:38] Nirant K: Someone needs to put all this together for Indian languages I assume? Including the straightforward challenges of API scaling and deployment
[2024-04-28, 10:54:31] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: At Scribie, we built a end-to-end Deepspeech based engine with 5000 hours of audio and transcripts (English), 2 people team, 3 years. Then OpenAI released Whisper which was trained on 600K+ hours of audio and transcripts. It totally nailed the a tough file from my dataset at the first try itself.
[2024-04-28, 10:56:20] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: Just fine-tune Whisper. I don't think anyone can beat it now.

My interest is in trying to understand the nature of intelligence

Unlike human brain, you can dissect and ablate neurons and see how does intelligence arise

[2024-04-28, 14:44:15] ~ Akash Singh: For hindi aand english deepgram is good and scalable. For regional azure is really good also has support for custom models where either you can share your vocab list or you cab train with audio. Customisation os there in deepgram but it’s very costly and we need to share both audio and text data no baising just with vocab for lm training. If you have data and have domain specific usecase then train your own kaldi model it’s small super fast works good for streaming usecase and also pocket friendly.

[2024-04-28, 16:12:44] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: With gpt-4 you don’t need the DB. It already has that info.
[2024-04-28, 16:13:44] ~ Pathik Ghugare: I'm not sure how accurate it is going to be
So I thought it would be better to have an external source for nutrient info

[2024-04-28, 16:28:09] ~ Shyam: Both Gpt-4 and Claude are really good at vision capabilities. You can't fine-tune them yet, but it seems like it will be available pretty soon, it's pretty straightforward once it's available. Even without it they are really good if you have narrowed down on the right prompt. You should check it out.

[2024-04-28, 20:42:04] ~ Manoj: The way I'm approaching is, (also rabbit r1 with leaked source code) is generate the playwright actions.
[2024-04-28, 20:43:06] Anubhav mishra Zupay: If the use case is simple you can actually create one with vision and function calling
[2024-04-28, 20:49:15] ~ Deepak: 2 ways to approach imo, through ui or through APIs, if you want to explore ui way checkout induced ai, basepilot(was doing this, not sure if they pivoted), no one in oss here yet afaik. Via APIs/API UI mix you can checkout opencopilot, gappy.ai(that's us)
[2024-04-28, 20:58:35] ~ Manoj: I don't think vision would be good. I can get the elements via building a DOM tree. Seen some approaches to it.
[2024-04-28, 20:59:25] ~ Manoj: Similarly APi doesn't work since not all api are open. And in my use case I want the user to continue after some actions are done.

There’s a new model on LMSys arena by OpenAI,it’s just named gpt-2

But couple of people who have tried it are saying it’s better than gpt-4,some are speculating it might be gpt-4.5

GPT-4 confidently gives out wrong answer.On asking to check again it invokes Python to find the value

[2024-04-29, 23:06:01] ~ Rohan: https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2024/04/rabbit-r1-impressions/678226/

The Atlantic reviews the Rabbit R1 and it... doesn't look good to say the least.
Recently, Marques Brownlee also trashed the Humane AI Pin.
[2024-04-29, 23:12:04] Avijit Thawani: Just tried it yday with a friend who bought it and regrets it. But in the one vision demo i tried it worked well - eg giving me info on a can i was holding. It’s also pretty light btw.
[2024-04-29, 23:14:00] Prakash Sankar Harbor: ya but one is priced like a toy ($200) and the other is priced like an iphone ($700 to $800)
[2024-04-29, 23:15:27] ~ Rohan: I've seen their vision demos too. I remember hearing that they use GPT-4V api for that, so not surprising it does decently well at least
[2024-04-29, 23:17:17] ~ Rohan: the reviews for both are scathing, even considering the price points 😓
[2024-04-29, 23:17:34] Prakash Sankar Harbor: yes, but we are talking about it.
[2024-04-29, 23:25:14] ~ Ganaraj: iPhone was not the first touch phone. Companies like rabbit and humane need to experiment for someone to succeed and bring out the next big thing.
[2024-04-29, 23:27:00] Vetrivel PS: And iPhone is not the best phone either, it's just the best marketed phone 😅
[2024-04-29, 23:29:25] ~ Ganaraj: I agree . But that is true about now. When it was released, iPhone was the best one. As an android fan I have to concede at least that 😅

[2024-04-30, 00:29:48] ~ Nayan Shah: is anyone here tried DSPY, for their use cases??? Also, what is your procedure for doing complex tasks with prompts and improving the prompt.. I ask GPT to help me make the prompts clearer / direct and instructive, would love to know the ways people do prompting.

Speak of the devil
[2024-04-30, 08:33:39] Shan: Based on our readings the use case is for hosted LLMs. Else the cost balloons up too much to be practical.
[2024-04-30, 09:29:27] ~ Aakash Bakhle: Everyone must have seen this coming
[2024-04-30, 09:57:38] ~ Pankaj Chawla: Iphone was the 1st capacitive touch phone, and that is what made the difference. Capacitive chabged the whole way we could interact with a device. With rabbit and humane there is no tech breakthrough as far as I can see.
[2024-04-30, 10:01:07] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Would you call the screen projection a step in the right direction ?
[2024-04-30, 10:08:50] ~ Pankaj Chawla: I dont know. Is it better to look at a projection on a surface thats not designed for projections (say hands) or look at a phone screen held in the same hand.
[2024-04-30, 10:12:41] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I think the projection features adds value as an alternative to augmented reality. But let's see
[2024-04-30, 10:13:02] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: *add
[2024-04-30, 10:28:32] ~ Manoj: It's not. There were quite some attempts made in past with that and people didn't like it. Projection needs a flat surface and dark env.. with humane the text isn't even readable
[2024-04-30, 10:50:43] Paras Chopra Wingify: Does anyone know a good project on extracting knowledge graphs from LLMs or doing some sort of approximate reasoning on knowledge graphs to discover net new knowledge e
[2024-04-30, 10:52:39] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Recently saw this paper -

[2024-04-30, 10:54:03] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Haven't used one don't know. But I get where you are coming from. Myself I am undecided
[2024-04-30, 10:54:28] Paras Chopra Wingify: https://github.com/EpistasisLab/KRAGEN

Found this too
[2024-04-30, 11:10:16] Paras Chopra Wingify: Found a good article https://neuml.hashnode.dev/generate-knowledge-with-semantic-graphs-and-rag
[2024-04-30, 11:15:22] ~ Pankaj Chawla: The limiting factor in all projections is the projection screen quality. Technically, the phone screen is also a back projection. Active projection screens will always work better. The true tech breakthrough would be projections on thin air. If that happens, I will bet all my money on it.
[2024-04-30, 11:15:53] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Holographic. Aligned 🙏
[2024-04-30, 11:17:01] ~ Bharath: For phone-replacement devices, won't that be a massive privacy limitation (tech aside)?
[2024-04-30, 11:27:56] ~ Deepak: recently across this https://github.com/monarch-initiative/ontogpt
[2024-04-30, 11:34:02] Nirant K: Approaches like these tend to be great at giving the illusion that we're discovering connection and in practice don't align with user intuitions. It's great soloware, terrible software
[2024-04-30, 11:59:07] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: While KG sounds promising, I have doubts about dynamic scaling and covering all use cases.
[2024-04-30, 12:02:28] Paras Chopra Wingify: What do you mean by this?
[2024-04-30, 12:11:59] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: TIL, there is OpenDevin - to build an open source version of Devin
https://opendevin.github.io/OpenDevin/

and the original devin contributed to opendevin - kind of wild !
https://twitter.com/gneubig/status/1775294728512131403
[2024-04-30, 12:41:46] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: MKBHD is right. I have tried all of these agents and they can't do anything better than a college project, but the Github repo has 23k stars. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-04-30, 12:44:52] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: they cant do better than a college project *today*

could be very different, 6 months or a year from now.

MKBHD = ?
when you use uncommon acronyms, expand them
[2024-04-30, 12:45:54] ~ Mahesh Sathiamoorthy: Marques Brownlee. He is kind of popular 😀
[2024-04-30, 12:46:10] ~ Mahesh Sathiamoorthy: Is he now reviewing GitHub projects also 😅
[2024-04-30, 12:48:20] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: There was a huge discussion about MKBHD, 20 messages above this.
[2024-04-30, 12:48:38] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: He should.
[2024-04-30, 12:48:57] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: i know him as a reviewer/youtube influencer, didnt know the acronym.
would you trust his opinions on open source ai ?
[2024-04-30, 12:49:04] Harshal Bhatia: And mkbhd is more popular as mkbhd. Very people know his full name 😂
[2024-04-30, 12:49:23] ~ Mahesh Sathiamoorthy: Yeah I had to look it up!
[2024-04-30, 12:51:34] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: i feel, limitless by the rewind folks will do better than rabbit.
rabbit seems too constrained
[2024-04-30, 12:54:05] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I tried myself. They all are very bad. 
MKBHD doesn't review AI projects. 
And, It's reviewer's job to get familiar with acronyms and trending topics if they feel the conversation is beneficial to them. Not my job to explain everything in detail.

[2024-04-30, 13:11:59] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Is it available for testing directly ?
[2024-04-30, 13:12:13] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: As a chat or similar sort of hosting ?
[2024-04-30, 13:28:19] Nirant K: Learned Graphs often have connections which defy intuition -- which is great initially but later users get annoyed because of the same reason 😄
[2024-04-30, 13:31:08] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Defy intuition as in? Unexpected relationships ?
[2024-04-30, 13:39:16] Paras Chopra Wingify: I agree

Knowledge generally doesn’t map as neatly as graphs seem to make it so
[2024-04-30, 13:46:20] Paras Chopra Wingify: But it does approximate how we think symbolically 

The way I think - LLMs are like intuition (give a context and they blurt an answer, like we do)

But there needs to be reasoning also which happens in small steps, traversing a concept space
[2024-04-30, 13:53:35] Dhruv Anand: not sure how it does things in the backend, but check out instagraph.ai
[2024-04-30, 14:17:33] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Not publiy available from what I can tell, but they developed & tested a chat/conversational agent
[2024-04-30, 14:20:01] ~ Deepak: We're using ontologically created knowledge graphs to compliment llm reasoning, to create a conversational web experience by connecting APIs and business concepts of a platform. Early results are promising. Starting to form an opinion that o-KG is going to be the next big thing for agents.
[2024-04-30, 14:33:05] Paras Chopra Wingify: where can i see this?

[2024-04-30, 16:51:16] Jacob Singh: Hey folks.  Long time lurker, first time asker… I’ve done a bit of LLM integration type programming and know basic ML fundas.  I’m curious to hear first hand examples of RLHF being deployed in actual software companies today and how it is implemented. In classification algorithms, this is pretty straightforward as you add additional examples and weights to an existing dataset, but within the realm of LLMs, I’m struggling to find real-world examples, particularly ones which create strong differentiators. Thanks!

Not really sure if it's worth the effort though considering the field is moving so fast and buy might be better than build

[2024-05-01, 00:46:22] Harsh Gupta Felvin: Suggestion:
- create a JSONL file with each item which you want to classify, add an id
- ⁠in the main prompt, give it the classes and few examples
- ⁠in the output ask for the output label per id
- ⁠fit as many items you can fit in one llm call
[2024-05-01, 00:48:05] Harsh Gupta Felvin: You should be done in 5-8 LLM calls unless the item is super long
[2024-05-01, 00:48:46] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: thanks, the file part confused me. can you elaborate?
[2024-05-01, 00:56:01] Harsh Gupta Felvin: prompt will look something like this
```
// For few shot example training

``` ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-01, 00:56:38] Harsh Gupta Felvin: You can then parse the output and use it for classification
[2024-05-01, 01:02:05] Dhruv Anand: Would be good to use a function calling abstraction like instructor library to do this. https://github.com/jxnl/instructor/blob/main/examples%2Fbatch-classification%2Frun.py

Trying to stuff more task instances per call will degrade performance though
[2024-05-01, 01:03:03] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: yeah I was thinking of using pydantic schema anyways for formatting response. Will look at some examples here as well
[2024-05-01, 01:08:39] Harsh Gupta Felvin: The performance of your prompt really depends on the complexity of the classification task. Ideally you should have good evals anyway, and you’ll know. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-01, 01:10:57] Harsh Gupta Felvin: Questions for Dhruv and others, when do you really need to use things like instructor? I personally prefer raw-dogging the prompt, without any frameworks, works most of the time, I know what’s going on, so the program is easy to modify and debug.
[2024-05-01, 01:11:52] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: I use the prompt myself, provide a schema as example in the prompt and use the response format if available for that model to provide the pydantic class
[2024-05-01, 01:37:59] ~ Bharat: What is raw-dogging a prompt? Just manually reading through it?
[2024-05-01, 01:41:32] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Not using external libraries like instructor shown above for formatting response from LLM calls.

[2024-05-01, 02:09:22] ~ Prateek🖤: Folks, I have a use case wherein I am trying to use GPT4 as a generic entity extraction model on a diverse set of documents.

Based on aggressive prompt engineering techniques, I have a fairly decent prompt now which gives more reasonably accurate results ( as per business requirements).

When I'm testing it on a specific document at a time, it performs well but when I'm trying to process multiple documents ( sequentially doing LLM calls to each document ),  I see deviation in results.
[2024-05-01, 02:09:48] ~ Prateek🖤: Any idea how to fix this?

I assume there is some kind of memory/context spillage across calls in LLM's knowledge base?
[2024-05-01, 02:10:23] ~ Prateek🖤: Every prompt should be targeted to that specific document ONLY ( without any context or 'reference' to any other doc )
[2024-05-01, 02:18:13] Dhruv Anand: Instructor is a fairly thin abstraction and allows introspecting into the resulting function spec sent to OpenAI easily. It's made it easy for me to standardize the process of info extraction, field descriptions, chain of thought, few shot examples, complex types.

I personally find typing out the raw openapi json function spec very tedious.

Paired with litellm, it allows easy experimentation with a lot of different LLM providers for these tasks. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-01, 02:20:34] Dhruv Anand: It's a middle ground between raw prompt engineering, which is very hard to standardize, and something like DSPy, where there is a lot of abstraction between you and the prompt.

‎[2024-05-01, 10:47:45] Priyank Agrawal: ‎image omitted
[2024-05-01, 10:50:14] ~ Shobhan: You can use function or tool calling to categorise user inputs and then can generate the next response on the basis of that.
[2024-05-01, 10:54:01] Priyank Agrawal: 1. Function calling is optionally called, i need it to be called everytime. (i know OAI added a always flag like 2 days ago, yet to check on it and its not on Azure OAI yet).
2. ⁠Function calling basically is for slot/variable filling right? Here i want the LLM to pick one of the then generate.
3. ⁠Both steps are needed to be done within 1 second, so, multiple calls to LLM are not an option.
[2024-05-01, 10:56:18] Soham (Composio.dev): Because most approaches are probabilistic and accuracy varies due to various reasons, a very different kind of solution that can be combined with any other suggestions here - 

Train a small fine tuned model (under 30 ms time to first token) to give out a probability around whether user is near end of sentence or occurrence and combine that with other probability from vad detectors.

Accuracy of vad increased by close to 20% for my personal bot.

Also helpful in low latency use cases. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-05-01, 11:28:00] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: Update LM studio, it’ll work
[2024-05-01, 11:34:01] ~ Ankit Saurav: You might consider a single-step solution that integrates classification and response generation. Can utilize a pre-trained model with additional fine-tuning on a dataset that includes examples of user inputs classified into your specified buckets along with the appropriate responses. This way, the model learns not only to classify inputs accurately but also to generate relevant responses based on the classification in a single process.
[2024-05-01, 11:35:43] Priyank Agrawal: ok, i want to avoid fine-tuning because it will require separate GPU to host while we dont have much usage.
[2024-05-01, 11:36:09] Priyank Agrawal: Do you think function calling can be utilized effetively?
[2024-05-01, 11:38:47] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Hey @917737887058 few months back you were about to sponsor a project to train Indic whisper. Do you have any updates on that?
[2024-05-01, 11:40:24] Nirant K: No takers
[2024-05-01, 11:43:34] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Interesting.
[2024-05-01, 11:43:45] ~ Ankit Saurav: Absolutely. You could pre-define a function that performs both tasks: classifying the input into one of the predefined buckets and then immediately generating a response based on the assigned bucket. This function would internally use conditional logic or a switch-case structure to determine the appropriate response based on the classification. Deploy a pre-trained model that is lightweight and optimized for inference speed like distilled versions of popular models such as DistilBERT, TinyBERT. These models can be hosted in memory on a standard server without the need for GPUs, thus reducing the latency involved in loading and running the model.
Also, you can use one API call to achieve this to minimize network delay. Addtionally, can use caching to store responses for common query buckets.
[2024-05-01, 11:44:33] ~ Ankit Saurav: Hey.. New here. Possible to provide a little more context here.
[2024-05-01, 11:45:40] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: IMHO the best way to do this is a chain of thought style prompt which breaks it down into a classification problem, calls a function and then generates an output incrementally. Maybe in 1-2 roundtrips.
[2024-05-01, 11:55:00] ~ Ankit Saurav: It would be interesting to experiment with this approach. The only challenge I can foresee is sticking to 1- second TAT that @918087880289 has mentioned. However, with 1) efficient prompting, 2) distilled models, 3) parallel processing and 4)caching; we might me able to solve for the use-case. Also, will be interesting to see if the percentage of cases wherein the round-trips are >2 are limited, in which case, we can still serve majority cases with a low TAT.
[2024-05-01, 11:57:18] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: we have generally seen that for production usecases, 1 second tat is fairly  flexible. in fact, a lot of usecases introduces deliberate latency to give it that human touch.
that said - i dont see a way that this can be achieved with a high enough accuracy without COT.
we have extensively experimented with finetuned models and they dont give the same performance as a COT did.
[2024-05-01, 11:57:40] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: in fact, we have had success with finetuning llama2 for COT and then using it..versus finetuning it for that specific usecase.
[2024-05-01, 11:58:17] Priyank Agrawal: been doing this with 1 prompt, like in the prompt mentioning you have 2 tasks to do, task.1 classify and task 2 generates a response based on classification. It works sometime but sometimes it fails miserably, the main cause we think is because we are passing all possible classifications (for example both yes and no) in the human message itself, it is getting confused.
[2024-05-01, 11:58:57] Priyank Agrawal: When you say COT, do you mean 2 separate requests?

[2024-05-01, 12:57:11] Nipun Jain: @918050098772 would love to know more about your learnings here. I’m experimenting with a few internal AI workflows and been using LangGraph till now. DSPy looks interesting to me for these reasons - 
- Prompt example hydration - makes it quite easy to evaluate top performing examples that can go as few shot examples
- Ability to write programs that get compiled to prompts - this means that the library acts as an adaptor for different models given each model has their own peculiarities when it comes to prompting 

These observations are based on first impressions and I haven’t gone deep into this, but your learnings would be helpful in informing my exploration here.

[2024-05-02, 11:51:53] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Ideally patients. Key factor is probably going to be: Can/Should they prescribe medication?

That's a whole other Pandora's box
[2024-05-02, 11:52:38] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Talk to enough doctors, and you will realise most of them are hallucinating half the time as well 😅
[2024-05-02, 11:53:52] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Haan but main point is there's a human that takes liability for poor decisions :) if an AI messes up who's accountable, the creator or the creation 😂
[2024-05-02, 11:55:03] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Lol fair point. Guess the scapegoat is missing from the equation.

[2024-05-02, 12:15:46] Priyank Agrawal: In function calling, after LLM give a function to run, is it mandatory to call the LLM back with the output of the function run?
I mean i know these are 2 separate request so not mandatory as such.
But I have a latency SLA, so I want the LLM to generate the response text and pass it as a parameter to the function called itself.

Anyone who is doing this? 
Any tricks/prompts on how to make it generate the proper response instead of just picking/extracting the values from the human messages? 
The gen text can be returned as the value of one of the param instead of the code calling it back to make a response string.
[2024-05-02, 12:26:50] Priyank Agrawal: Part of the reason of wanting this is to reduce latency and the reason that my function is kind of blank (does not do anything)
[2024-05-02, 12:35:13] Shalabh Aspiro: You can directly generate the response itself instead of extracting parameters to generate the response.

This example in the cookbook explains how to directly generate a SQL query by giving the database schema in function parameter description. Same can be done by you if you ask it to do all the steps you want, in one single go. https://cookbook.openai.com/examples/how_to_call_functions_with_chat_models#specifying-a-function-to-execute-sql-queries

[2024-05-02, 17:22:39] ~ Adhitya Swaminathan: Yeah I’ve tried this before and it’s okayish. The hardest part is getting control and consistency  out of it.

Converting raster to vector isn’t ideal since that makes it more difficult to edit the vector versions, because of problems during conversion.

Adobe seems to do it well, but then again, they must have a great dataset to train models to directly generate this stuff.
[2024-05-02, 17:24:13] Divya Tak: but even adobe's internal raster to vector tool that Illustrator has, is not great. You cant realistically use it to edit the image.

[2024-05-03, 17:19:09] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: json mode if you’re using openai? Instructor should also work.
[2024-05-03, 18:45:52] ~ ☆Sreedevi: You could use langchain's JsonOutputParser (+ pydantic data model) to get the output in the required json format. See https://python.langchain.com/docs/modules/model_io/output_parsers/types/json for an example.
[2024-05-03, 18:53:35] Nirant K: Please don't. It's slow, brittle and adds unnecessary errors and latency. Langchain should ideally depreciate that in favour of fn calling 😅

2. Sam says his famous 50million, 500 million and 50B to create AGI.
3. He talks about things OpenAI owes it to society.
4. In one of the QnA's when asked what you would be doing for career if you were 19 today and in Stanford? His Answer: AI Research. Industry or Academia? Industry, since AI needs compute.
5. The entire stack of computing with supply chains needs to be designed from the ground up. The demand for compute is ever increasing.
6. He makes comparisons on how much compute AI uses as a percentage of total world's compute. Then said, how much of it would be transformational. The figure was around 100 or 1000 GW. 
7. Bets on nuclear energy as usual. 
8. He did say about life not changing that much, but the only guarantee is that models will keep on getting intelligent each year and that is a big thing!

- surround yourself with original thinkers
- go with conventional wisdom when it's right and find the area where you have a unique( possibly contrarian) insight
- build the muscle of learning to trust your intuition and thought process ( build conviction in your own unique, possibly contrarian ideas/insights)

[2024-05-04, 13:18:44] Abhishek Maiti: I monitor this leaderboard once in a while https://gorilla.cs.berkeley.edu/leaderboard.html
[2024-05-04, 13:19:55] Soham (Composio.dev): Yes that's perfect, but couple of limitations. 

10k max files. No direct search API as far as I know, we need to use assistants to get an answer.
[2024-05-04, 13:20:58] Nirant K: But that's what you asked na? RAG as API?
[2024-05-04, 13:26:44] Soham (Composio.dev): I understand the confusion. 

So my usecase is following 

I have few customers who deploy agents on our platform. These agents have access to applications like gmail, google docs and so on. 
To answer questions like "Show me all emails about quarterly financial reports", we are currently working on architecture where 

Agents write code to get all emails from gmail and put them in a dynamic RAG Store (Something they create on the fly)

Then using the query, apply search/questions on the fly and ideally give back list of documents along with potential answer. 

Openai Docs APIs can be fitted into this but ideally an independent vectorised document store with a search layer on top of it will be a much better solution.

new drugs have to show net benefit over old drugs, and that is hard. just showing efficacy is not enough, it has to provide net benefit over current standard of care. plus patents prevent many approaches

[2024-05-06, 10:48:05] Rajaswa Patil: Not sure how the 100% accuracy will be achieved, but if it’s doing well for SQL or another language with a similar grammar as KQL, then you can generate that and implement a transpiler to convert it to KQL?

[2024-05-06, 12:56:12] Vamshi: Slightly tangential but a worthy tangent.

I’m a massive fan of Rahul Sarpeshkar’s life long work on cytomorphic computation using analog noise perturbed models.

The work has beginnings as early as his early pre doctoral work on neural cochleas with Carver Mead but if you trace through the threads you’ll see an incredible coherence all the way up to his recent stuff on bio molecular supercomputers for drug discovery and validation.

[2024-05-06, 13:16:39] ~ ~I: *Need help with finding top questions asked in a chatbot*

I created a chatbot and I am saving all the questions asked in the chatbot in log
Now I need to provide insights to the client, like "top 10 questions (types) that are asked"
what's the best way to do it? (I am thinking of clustering but other approaches are very welcome)
Also, if you can direct me to some service which can do it, that would be really great

[2024-05-06, 13:28:26] ~ Joy: Clustering is the easiest approach
[2024-05-06, 13:54:12] Cheril Chicago Human+AI: if you are implementing a semantic cache to store the queries, you could include a counter to store how many times that semantic query was hit, then simply return the the top 10 queries by counts
[2024-05-06, 14:14:23] ~ ~I: but that would mean defining semantic queries beforehand right?
not really efficient in that case since we might dozens of different kind of queries
or am I missing something?
[2024-05-06, 14:17:17] Cheril Chicago Human+AI: umm I am assuming this is your use case exactly: you have a chatbot, where users will go on asking their questions, you store these somewhere, now over a time you want to access the top 10 semantically different questions from these right?

[2024-05-06, 14:29:55] ~ ~I: yeah but I don't know beforehand how many different types of semantic queries are there
for example - let's say we have 50 different semantic queries today and tomorrow they introduce a new feature which introduces 5 different new kind of queries
how will the new kind of queries be included in the semantic cache automatically?
[2024-05-06, 14:30:55] Cheril Chicago Human+AI: umm if you do not mind, could you give me an example, i think i am missing something in understanding your problem
[2024-05-06, 14:43:57] ~ ~I: example -

let's say there are 50 semantic questions we identified now and one of them is related to feature 1 pricing, "how much feature 1 costs?" or "cost of running feature 1 for 6 months", would come here

but now suppose we introduce feature 2 and let's say same questions are asked, but for feature 2

since feature 2 is not in semantic cache, those questions will either not be identified or put into feature 1

so semantic cache will need to be updated everytime manually which is not ideal
[2024-05-06, 14:47:02] Cheril Chicago Human+AI: hmm, also a counter question how are you implementing a cache for this?
[2024-05-06, 14:48:16] Cheril Chicago Human+AI: like does feature 2 question even get answered or sematic cache return results for feature 1 itself, as i think the questions similarity might be high

[2024-05-06, 14:56:26] ~ ~I: currently storing in elasticsearch
like the "top 10 questions" is still in designing phase
but you can replace feature 1 and feature 2 with maybe "order an item" and "change address of delivery"
*basically constraint is semantic queries are not fixed and are changing real-time*

[2024-05-06, 22:14:11] Nirant K: Yes. But Lindy effects kick in
[2024-05-06, 22:15:05] Aaryaman Vir VC: interesting way to look at it. Even though the underlying model may be commoditized , rapid inference may carry a premium. Because even though you get the same response from Llama3 or whtever running on H100s, the extra latency may kill your chat/transcription/translation/agent-agent UX
[2024-05-06, 22:15:38] Nirant K: Latency isn't what they're selling. They're selling chips made for defense use cases
[2024-05-06, 22:15:38] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Have you heard about H200 inference numbers?

[2024-05-06, 22:18:22] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Groq can’t keep up with Nvidia, and these custom chips are not versatile for training. To host a model today, they are burning Amazon rainforest worth of energy.
[2024-05-06, 22:20:05] Aaryaman Vir VC: I didn’t realize this - all the positioning i’ve seen has been around rapid inference using popular open source models.. Although I have seen them highlight the fact that their supply chain has no China/Taiwan risk and is largely in the US
[2024-05-06, 22:21:00] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: You can sell anything to US Military Industry Complex for National security at any price, this may be the good TAM.
[2024-05-06, 22:22:36] Nirant K: No, the fast inference thing is what we they sell to investors and devs. The CEO goes around and gives talks at defense expos.
[2024-05-06, 22:34:03] Srimouli GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: But how sustainable is to keep with the pace in the race of generating tokens, as race of foundational models has reached a plateau.

[2024-05-06, 23:10:26] ~ Shree: But I felt, there has always been a series of plateau and then burst for foundational models, like talent to teach, make and reach better level is tough. 

But if you see individual organizations wise, we are i guess growing so far
[2024-05-06, 23:10:51] Nirant K: I've not seen a plateau since BERT?
[2024-05-06, 23:11:30] ~ Shree: Do you feel there is one now ?
[2024-05-06, 23:11:37] Nirant K: No
[2024-05-06, 23:12:03] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: It’s more like Hedonic treadmill for us than plateau in AI
[2024-05-06, 23:12:15] Srimouli GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: My pov in saying the fm reaching plateau would mean that if you see the research since the chatgpt became publicly available there has been an excellent rise of lot of architectures of fms but in last few months I see the direction of research gravitating towards training the older models with better data rather than creating new models altogether and I feel it's more important to work on prepping up better versions of the data because when data quality increases even the smaller models are giving good results. And smaller models save lot of compute resources. I don't mean plateau being totally stagnant for a longer period but I'm looking at last 1 year
[2024-05-06, 23:13:01] ~ Shree: So I think more of my question was intended towards Srimouli saying it has plateaud. 

Considering that lens, if models haven't significantly improved since GPT4, I can get how is POV can be bit different from yours
[2024-05-06, 23:13:36] Nirant K: Last 1y hasn't been plateau either. Everything from Mamba to other approaches have come out. And new behavior like vision, function calling and constitutional learning went mainstream
[2024-05-06, 23:15:50] ~ Shree: I think it is more of explore and exploit, somethings which have been explored and doing well are being exploit, but I don't think explore has been decreased, it is I feel even higher than before but significant level impact from explore takes a long time to give marginally high results.
[2024-05-06, 23:15:58] Nirant K: Not to mention, infra around LLMs has grown so much from Langgraph to Guardrails
[2024-05-06, 23:17:27] Abhishek Mishra: there's no plateau, it's only going to speed up, so brace yourself 😂
[2024-05-06, 23:17:54] Abhishek Mishra: everything is going to get even more cheaper and faster, more accuracy at lower quantized binaries
[2024-05-06, 23:19:32] Srimouli GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: Yeah that's one way research is headed
[2024-05-06, 23:20:06] Abhishek Mishra: Regarding people focusing on data, if there's a working strategy then of course people will throw scale at it
[2024-05-06, 23:20:07] ~ Shree: A good example I felt to showcase, the growth is looking at things like AutoGPT or babyAGI, they seem like ideas so long back and now when we see models reaching somewhat close to that level of working it just feels amazing that only one year has crossed.
[2024-05-06, 23:20:46] Abhishek Mishra: Once scale stops giving value, it becomes marginal then evryone will dig deeper. Until then pockets of research will pop with people trying to do things at small param size and interesting improvements like KAN

[2024-05-07, 11:55:56] C Chaitanya: As we all know, Chunking is a big problem with RAG. The problem with chunking is how do we decide which is the best size for the chunk. Wanted to do a small experiment. Forget AI, how do humans chunk the text :)
Consider the news item below(some random news item I picked up from the web)
How would you chunk it? How many chunks would you make. Not sure what is the best way to reply without spamming the group. If you dont wanna spam, you can DM me with your chunks. I will collate and share results here.

"A 42-year-old Indian-origin man, Sachin Sahoo, was shot by San Antonio police officer on April 21 after he hit two officers with his vehicle while they were attempting to arrest him in connection with an aggravated assault case.
Sahoo, originally from Uttar Pradesh, was declared dead at the scene. According to PTI sources, he may have been a naturalized US citizen.
Preliminary investigation suggests that officers were called to a home in Cheviot Heights, San Antonio, just before  pm on April 21, responding to a report of Aggravated Assault with a Deadly Weapon.
Upon reaching the spot, the cops found a 51-year-old woman deliberately hit by a vehicle driven by Sahoo, who had fled the scene. The victim was taken to a nearby hospital in critical condition, and San Antonio Police Detectives issued a felony arrest warrant for Sahoo.
Later that evening, neighbours alerted the police that Sahoo had returned to the original location. When officers arrived and tried to contact him, he struck two of them with his vehicle. One officer discharged his weapon, hitting Sahoo, who was "pronounced deceased on scene." One officer was taken to a local hospital for treatment, while the other was treated at the scene. No one else was harmed during the incident, which remains under investigation.
Police Chief Bill McManus stated that Sahoo had run over his roommate with his vehicle, leaving her in critical condition and requiring multiple surgeries.
Officers had gone to Sahoo's known location to arrest him based on the issued warrant. When they found him, he got into his car and managed to squeeze through the police vehicles blocking his driveway, hitting the officers in the process. The other officer fired at Sahoo to stop him. The police have yet to review the bodycam footage to determine further details.
Sahoo's ex-wife, Leah Goldstein, revealed that he had been diagnosed with bipolar disorder and exhibited symptoms of schizophrenia. "He suffered the past ten years with bipolar disorder," Goldstein said. "He also had symptoms of schizophrenia." She described Sahoo as a great father who provided for their family while she was a stay-at-home mom for many years.
“He couldn't understand what was wrong with him," she said in the news report. "He would hear voices. And hallucinate and just hear voices and just get stuck in his own mind.”
[2024-05-07, 12:21:33] ~ Joy: I feel chunking depends on the domain of data because that determines the granularity level of information. For news probably paragraphs are good enough. If it's scientific then maybe we need to check for tables, charts and other forms of dara.
[2024-05-07, 12:23:04] ~ Joy: Another variable is the kind of user queries as well. Common chunking techniques might be a good starting point but for better performance custom chunking is required.

I dont find the scoring consistent. Am i doing the prompting wrong? are there better ways to do it?
I already tried RAGAS
[2024-05-07, 12:58:38] Abhishek Mishra: how are you scoring it? 
> are you leaving everything on the model or defining the criterias?

> are you letting it generate a rationale for the scoring first before it gives the output? 

> is your scoring requirement a poor, average, good, excellent style or just random numbering from 1-10?
[2024-05-07, 12:59:48] C Chaitanya: Agreed. 100% chunking depends on the domain of the data. But I think we have not even explored for simpler cases. Like why only paras? Is the embedding capturing all the info? Is it missing some. How would a human actually chunk so that we can benchmark. How can we benchmark chunking?
[2024-05-07, 13:26:38] Srimouli GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: May be you can try something like this have two LLMs generate the response, where you are sure one of the LLM gives the best results majority of the time and then ask GPT-4 To rank which response is better and then Try to apply elo/glicko scoring it's relative you can check how your current LLM is performing confirming to the better performing LLM and then decide
[2024-05-07, 13:37:50] ~ Swapnil: a different perspective. thinking out loud.

we look at logical context switches or topical changes when we think about chunks. what if we explore if we can find points where similarity between sentences or chuncks of sentences differ a lot
[2024-05-07, 13:46:53] Vipul Maheshwari: Hey everyone! I am testing out some conversational ai POCs and want to get a brief but an adequate comparison between Assembly AI / DeepGram for real time audio transcription, I read some articles and tried to compare the latency with accuracy but different sources points to different results! 

Any stronghold opinion with the comparison?
[2024-05-07, 13:48:08] C Chaitanya: Exactly. That's why asking the right questions is important:)
We can explore in that direction. My team is trying out some fun stuff in this direction. Will share the outcome over the weekend. ‎<This message was edited>

We found Deepgram to be better for streaming use cases and Assembly for batch transcriptions.
[2024-05-07, 14:22:59] Dr. Ashith Generative AI WA Group: > are you leaving everything on the model or defining the criterias?
i have defined a few metrics and provided the llm the metric definition, evaluation criteria and a scoresheet. Prompt is inspired from the Geval paper. is there any other paper which improves on Geval?
> are you letting it generate a rationale for the scoring first before it gives the output? 
Was not doing this earlier. After letting it add a rationale as an output its giving more consistent results.
> is your scoring requirement a poor, average, good, excellent style or just random numbering from 1-10?
Scoring is defined from 1-5 with each number having a description.
[2024-05-07, 14:25:34] Cheril Chicago Human+AI: I think we as humans follow a dynamic chunking process (at least I do). For example lets say I am learning deepwalk and I already know how skipgram with negative sampling works, I see that some steps in deepwalk are very similar to sgns Which I had learnt way back but I will still chunk just those steps in a different manner than other stuff I learn in deep walk. 

Also I think while thinking about chunking we should not discount the generation that needs to take place after chunking. What chunk even if it seems weird would lead to the best generation, will it be something that has lesser number of highly attended tokens so it can focus more or vice versa. Does it need diversity in tokens for proper generation(high recall generation) or no. Ig these factors need to be studied
[2024-05-07, 14:44:04] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Associative chunking ?
[2024-05-07, 14:49:51] Cheril Chicago Human+AI: Yes I think there is some literature in cogsci/neuro science on how this happens in humans but have not read a lot ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-05-07, 14:59:03] Dev Aggarwal: This looks too small to even chunk :D (eg openai uses 800 token chunksize by default)

[2024-05-07, 15:29:55] Abhishek Mishra: always ask for justification and rationale, these models like to talk, use json response format to segregate rationale and evaluation.

For the scoring part, you'll get more consistent results and accuracy with poor, average, good, excellent sort of rating instead of just numbers 

The models don't understand numbers very well and you'll get inconsistencies as will as  bias in the outcome due to it always going for safe option. 

You could also try using the keyword "strict" or other adjectives to change your prompt to make it act as a better judge.
[2024-05-07, 16:04:03] Dr. Ashith Generative AI WA Group: If you could provide a brief on how it relates to the topic it would be great!

[2024-05-07, 18:58:57] ~ Sid: I think having a human in the loop is crucial(goes without saying its the parent or supervisor). But also transformer based models cannot establish Plans(in the AI sense) and Verify correctness so any child-guided or agent-guided framework would need to incorporate the best of Transformer’s ability to do good knowledge extraction and AI theories abilities for planning and execution.

I am seeking recommendations for open-source models that are capable of *extracting structured data from webpages*. Specifically, I need a model that can process both *HTML code and screenshot images*. A good example of what I'm looking for is the model discussed in the paper "WebLM," available at https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.18262. However, the code for WebLM has not been made available as open-source. Any suggestions for similar models would be greatly appreciated. Thank you!

[2024-05-08, 00:14:40] Vignesh Baskaran: TS or Python version? If its Python, I can do it with you. If its TS, I can rope in along with ChatGPT 😉
[2024-05-08, 00:14:44] Dhruv Anand: why would you want/expect a single model to handle both these things (html code and screenshot images) well?

You'd ideally want to use a combination of an OCR engine/framework, an html parser (like beautifulsoup) and a LLM (with structured output) to do the job well
[2024-05-08, 00:16:18] Harsh Gupta Felvin: Python works for me!

[2024-05-08, 00:51:06] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Our paths keep converging. Literally struggling with same problem.This is a much better library and well maintained (than building a basic scrapper ourself). Keep us posted Vignesh.

Their API is free? What am I not getting on how they survive? 🙂
[2024-05-08, 00:54:10] Vignesh Baskaran: It is because they are not parsing it via any LLM Nitin. It is all plain preprocessing to the best of my understanding. It's just a Lambda function
[2024-05-08, 01:00:19] Nirant K: Cc @919929636400 was building this?

i still cant understand the link between law of large numbers and most volume of N-dimension sphere being close to its surface

""For instance, the fact that most of the mass of a unit ball in high dimensions lurks near the boundary of the ball can be interpreted as a manifestation of the law of large numbers""

does anyone get it?
[2024-05-08, 15:45:06] Karthik S Delhivery: Where I gave a line graph and asked it to 

1. Extract insights 
2. ⁠extract the data and give CSV
[2024-05-08, 16:12:04] Abhishek Mishra: this is how i would intuit it-

if we divide the sphere into infinite thin spherical shells then volume of a sphere is more as surface is 4*pi*r^2, more surface means more volume per shell.

in a higher dimensional space, an equivalent would be that most data points lie closer to the surface or in the higher dimensions than the lower dimensions. so most of the results of experiments/training would also reflect more and more as the dimensions increase. 

i am just interpreting though, not my own views.

[2024-05-08, 16:33:51] Abhishek Mishra: my interpretation of this was -
law of large numbers means as the number of experiments increase the results would reflect what we actually expect using mathematics (approaching their expected value).
in this case, we can expect as the number of dimensions increase, the bulk of data points or "volume" should be near the surface or higher dimensions rather than smaller dimensions. This is because expected volume of a infinitesimally thin spherical shell near the surface would be larger than volume of any shell with lesser dimensions/radius.

@19377081307
[2024-05-08, 17:02:50] ~ Pathik Ghugare: Sry to interrupt this discussion 
I had a doubt regarding reversing OCR  
Given an image of a document and a text present in that image, is there any smart way to do a kind of "reverse OCR" to find out position or bounding box of a particular text? 

In my use case I get a structured text from documents using GPT4V model but I need a bounding box for each text

Approach that I first thought was to run an OCR on document, try to match text with the respective OCR box text but the issue I m facing is if some text repeats e.g. I've lots of amounts in the image like $1 then there's no way to find out to which bbox it is supposed to be mapped 

So I was wondering if theres any improvement on top of this?  or I need to switch to other VisionEncoderDecoder models that output text as well as boxes?
[2024-05-08, 17:12:15] ~ Saniya Jaswani: Interesting que
Have worked on OCR
Have worked on object detection.
But text detection is new
[2024-05-08, 17:12:55] ~ Saniya Jaswani: R u looking for existing model or approach which can be trained ?
[2024-05-08, 17:13:14] ~ Saniya Jaswani: Faster RCNN works beautifully for obj detection
[2024-05-08, 17:17:22] Paras Chopra Wingify: A crude approach would be to do some sort of binary search where you keep reducing the width of the box and shifting its center point and measuring overlap of OCR text with original text

Since OCR is fast, I guess this may work out

With enough data generated this ways I’m sure you can fine tune an existing model to directly predict bounding boxes  (e.g. take a multi modal LLM and have its last layer hooked to MLP to output a bounding box)
[2024-05-08, 17:19:53] ~ Pathik Ghugare: I mean 
I've text obtained 
I've an image
I've OCR boxes
Need to find where that text lies in that image
[2024-05-08, 17:20:40] ~ Shobhan: google cloud vision api will be able to do this: https://cloud.google.com/vision/docs/ocr
[2024-05-08, 17:20:52] ~ ᴘʀᴀᴛeeᴋ: Can you first do boundary detection, then do the text detection individually for the detected boundaries. Can be parallelised too..
[2024-05-08, 17:21:34] ~ Pathik Ghugare: Yeah but only issue with training multimodal LLM is OCR is not quite accurate :/ 
but will try it out
[2024-05-08, 17:21:49] Dhruv Anand: a cloud-based OCR service provides bounding boxes for each line/word it reads via OCR. You can run search on that extracted json.

[2024-05-08, 23:56:25] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: @16503086193 have you tried extracting tables as labeled data?
[2024-05-08, 23:57:48] Rishabh Refuel.ai: Thanks @19377081307 - excited to announce this today. Been fun (and painstaking effort) to get it to this perf level
[2024-05-08, 23:58:07] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Like passing a table in markdown and asking it generate json output where header is kind of label.
[2024-05-08, 23:58:37] Rishabh Refuel.ai: This should work quite well. We had a lot of JSON generation tasks in the mix
[2024-05-08, 23:59:06] Rishabh Refuel.ai: Can give it a spin with a handful of examples from you?
[2024-05-08, 23:59:19] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I have used OpenHermes before for json generation but reasoning was not quite well.
[2024-05-09, 00:00:25] Rishabh Refuel.ai: Yeah, as a follow up we do want to have a benchmark for these JSON generation tasks. Can be surprisingly challenging for sure
[2024-05-09, 00:00:54] Harsh Gupta Felvin: Any JS equivalents for LiteLLM?

[2024-05-09, 01:09:41] ~ Aravind Putrevu: @16503086193 I’ve heard good stuff about Refuel from the likes of Rak 😉 also some competitors. It’s great to see a new launch! 
Do you also have something in the works for data authenticity/credibility?
[2024-05-09, 01:15:21] Rishabh Refuel.ai: Appreciate the kind words :)

What do you mean by data authenticity / credibility here? There’s a couple of things I could share but wanted to make sure I fully understand
[2024-05-09, 01:17:37] ~ Aravind Putrevu: Like Toxicity score for a data point, trustworthy-ness. 

For example, the sun rises in the west, and you say you need to generate a label with a trustworthy-ness score. 

PS: I also used and worked on Cleanlab for a while.
[2024-05-09, 01:23:37] Rohit GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group PremAI: Hey folks!

any suggestions good papers/implementations/discussions on adding self-knowledge to LLMs if you are building from scratch. basically branding your SFT model with your company’s data. I tried finetuning it with few examples but it didn’t work well. Maybe number of datapoints were small, not sure, but looking into more ideas/requirements on this.

[2024-05-09, 01:27:11] Rishabh Refuel.ai: Haven't tested/benchmarked on the trust-worthiness / fact remembering.. mostly because it's unclear to me how much we should rely on facts that are remembered by the LLM. A common pattern is introducing some web search into the mix, and then most reasonable LLMs do well. 

Is that how you've approached it / curious for your thoughts? @919901758855+91 99017 58855

[2024-05-09, 06:04:08] Nirant K: The Model Spec is a powerhouse "spec" in terms of expected behaviours from models. Great for thinking about Instruction tuning, RLHF/DPO and other behaviours. It's a little too OpenAI specific and makes some opinionated choices — which is even better!

[2024-05-09, 09:53:23] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: The models are generally good + multilingual support. Qwen is good in a variety of languages
[2024-05-09, 09:56:23] Abhishek Mishra: plus range too, you could use a Qwen 0.5B or Qwen 1.8B to test the quality of your data like DBRX before committing to a bigger model with full resources
[2024-05-09, 09:56:58] Abhishek Mishra: if Qwen base was really competitive, it would make for an amazing model for experimentation and education because of the 0.5B version
[2024-05-09, 09:58:17] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: We did vision model on Qwen-VL, but it ends up replying in Chinese out of nowhere.
[2024-05-09, 09:59:30] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I guess they are going for general purpose vision model. I like moondream size model and then specializing it for narrow tasks.
[2024-05-09, 10:08:52] Abhishek Mishra: yeah that's an issue with all Chinese models, same with Deepseek too

[2024-05-09, 10:20:39] Sumba: Hi guys 
Im looking to scrape company overview data from Glassdoor for a poc dataset 
Glassdoor has roadblocks to prevent scraping, so can't get away with just selenium or some package

Hence I need to use a scraping service
Anyone here with experience using a scraping service and can suggest some good ones? 


Services I have tried as of now as Scrapfly ,and Apify
[2024-05-09, 10:23:48] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I guess if Glassdoor is making it illegal to scrap their data, folks would be hesitant to answer the question here in a public forum.
[2024-05-09, 10:24:24] Sumba: It's not illegal lol
[2024-05-09, 10:24:38] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Ohh okay
[2024-05-09, 10:29:49] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Not that top secret if we know about it. So perhaps just marketing
[2024-05-09, 10:34:39] Rishabh Refuel.ai: In the past I’ve used Scrapingbee with good success on hard to scrape websites. 

Also Bright Data is one of the leaders and their solution should work well too: https://brightdata.com
[2024-05-09, 10:35:04] Abhishek Mishra: Try this - https://github.com/mguideng/gdscrapeR
[2024-05-09, 10:35:19] Abhishek Mishra: It's an R Library
[2024-05-09, 10:36:24] Sumba: Saw this 
Reviews are easy, i already have that data, company overview is what I need
[2024-05-09, 10:36:39] Abhishek Mishra: actually it looks abandoned too. so may not have been that useful
[2024-05-09, 10:37:01] Sumba: Will test out
[2024-05-09, 10:38:21] Sumba: Ive checked out all the opensource repos and libraries possibly of help for this Glassdoor scraping tasks. No scene

Hence need scraping services in specific

[2024-05-09, 10:43:45] Sumba: Read the documentation. Seems a bit higher effort in set up and built more for general web crawling than specific url scraping
[2024-05-09, 10:44:48] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Brightdata is a good option then
[2024-05-09, 10:44:55] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Oh yeah yeah it's an industrial grade scraper😅 common crawl uses this not meant for single site
[2024-05-09, 10:57:13] Nirant K: Off topic. Please no more scraper parser questions unless you've something not answered by scrolling up
[2024-05-09, 10:57:43] Nirant K: Or ask on Watercooler
[2024-05-09, 10:59:26] Sumba: ?
It's the dataset for a GenAI project. How off topic is it
[2024-05-09, 10:59:51] Sumba: How does watercooler make more sense?

[2024-05-09, 11:23:35] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Math and Coding seems to be more of a dataset issue(read XOT prompting data missing from training data )
[2024-05-09, 11:24:48] Abhishek Mishra: Yes - https://lmsys.org/blog/2024-05-08-llama3/
[2024-05-09, 11:25:07] Sumba: Thank you 🙏
[2024-05-09, 11:26:13] Abhishek Mishra: yes lmsys arena users don't typically use the models for intensive tasks but even with the smaller sample, there is some gap between llama3 and top tier models

https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/09/technology/meet-my-ai-friends.html

My opinion :
They cant replace human friendships for sure but with the loneliness epidemic getting bigger around the globe, can they help fill in some gaps and help avoid self-harm

Was reminded of the increasing pace of suicides in Kota this year.
If you are reluctant to talk about your worries and anxieties , can an ai therapist help ?
[2024-05-09, 21:53:37] ~ Sushant Ardent: Reminds me of the movie "Her".
[2024-05-09, 21:55:41] ~ Sushant Ardent: Depends a lot on how society evolves from a human interaction perspective. Even today people sitting in the same room get occupied with their devices. Finding a digital companion will be a thing if we as a species don't take care of our social interactions seriously.
[2024-05-09, 21:55:42] ~ Sidharth Ramachandran: Isn't this one of the biggest use cases for  character.ai who also have very strong usage numbers - even better than chatgpt if I remember reading correctly somewhere.

In general, I think this also applies to the older generation - across the world they just want to speak to someone and many times it's not possible for family to be there. Charities in the UK run volunteer helplines that older folks can call. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-09, 21:56:20] ~ Neha M: As long as someone doesn't replace real humans completely in their social circle... What would be wrong in having the option of AI friends?

There have been moments I have chatted with ChatGPT... Brainstormed... Discussed mental health... Done some cbt sessions... It doesn't replace my therapist, but it was great option to have
[2024-05-09, 21:56:52] Prakash Sankar Harbor: I think it's a good step, but the problem is a lot of growth in therapy comes from being challenged
[2024-05-09, 21:56:59] Prakash Sankar Harbor: would you take a challenge from an AI seriously?
[2024-05-09, 21:57:27] Prakash Sankar Harbor: you don't go to therapy to get someone to agree with you, half hte time it's also cos they're calling you out on your shit
[2024-05-09, 21:58:40] ~ Neha M: yes hence I said it doesn't replace a real therapist

[2024-05-09, 22:02:27] Prakash Sankar Harbor: that's not the only problem though right - you have to believe the challenge
[2024-05-09, 22:02:39] Prakash Sankar Harbor: I think that's the issue with anything in the mental health treatment space - do people actually want to get better
[2024-05-09, 22:02:43] Prakash Sankar Harbor: or is the real fix happy pills?
[2024-05-09, 22:02:59] Prakash Sankar Harbor: wide spread legalized mdma in non-addictive form? seems to be the case with weight loss (ozempic)
[2024-05-09, 22:03:26] ~ Neha M: This is a topic that is probably irrelevant to the group... people who actually want to go to therapy ... _do_ actually want to get treated... people who are forced to go to therapy won't bother
[2024-05-09, 22:03:36] Anshul Bhide Replit: it still feels very artificial
[2024-05-09, 22:03:51] Prakash Sankar Harbor: why is it irrelevant lol - we're talking about the effectiveness of mental health AI
[2024-05-09, 22:03:54] Anshul Bhide Replit: maybe i’ve spent too much time with ChatGPT but I can make out when something is written with an LLM or not
[2024-05-09, 22:04:16] Prakash Sankar Harbor: the business case might hold, but the medical case I think is unlikely to hold

[2024-05-09, 22:09:56] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: a human therapist cant possibly remember every single thing you have told them.
Most of the good ones take good notes.

Can an ai therapist co-pilot increase the effectiveness and productivity of human therapists ?
Make the median therapist much, much better ?

I think, irrespective of the field - doctors, coders, therapists - any kind of knowledge work - ai can make the median knowledge worker, much much better, if harnessed and designed correctly.
Some parallels with automation in cockpits and aeroplane pilots, can help us integrate ai in day to day workflows effectively & optimally.

[2024-05-10, 09:47:54] Paras Chopra Wingify: Curious - is there a good re-ranker for search results or RAG pipleine that does online learning (via RL) or otherwise 

Also has someone integrated BM2.5 and Semantic retrieval effectively
[2024-05-10, 09:48:59] Nirant K: Learning to Rank systems are rarely "pure" online. But most RecSys do work like this. Including Amazon e-commerce and others.
[2024-05-10, 09:50:00] Nirant K: RRF seems to be quite popular way to combine sparse and dense retrieval. It's well loved because it's fast, though a true reranker often works better. 

So boils down to your latency budget ig.
[2024-05-10, 09:50:18] Paras Chopra Wingify: Rrf?
[2024-05-10, 09:50:36] Nirant K: Reciprocal Rank Fusion
[2024-05-10, 09:51:22] Paras Chopra Wingify: By online I mean almost-online

I understand collaboratuve filtering but curious if anyone applied deep RL or traditional RL techniques on ranking 

Idea is you start with non-informative re-ranker but purely learn via user feedback on what they’re clicking on
[2024-05-10, 09:53:04] Nirant K: ‎You deleted this message.
[2024-05-10, 09:53:38] Paras Chopra Wingify: Any good articles to read on this?

[2024-05-10, 09:55:30] Vishwam Jindal Webnyay: https://openai.com/index/introducing-the-model-spec/

Interesting for folks implementing Responsible AI practices. It'll be interesting to see how "applicable laws" is implemented across various countries.
[2024-05-10, 09:56:10] Paras Chopra Wingify: Point is BM2.5 and cosine similarity would give different ranks so are they even comparable
[2024-05-10, 09:56:43] Nirant K: Yes, most recsys today are learning to rank systems — and not colab filtering as is widely taught. Traditional RL "feedback" is used widely. They often already have very good feedback ingestion systems, so they can "adapt" quite quickly.

You can see this in action by giving your Amazon or Spotify to someone of different preferences e.g. different age, gender
[2024-05-10, 09:56:48] Paras Chopra Wingify: What I was imagining was query or result dependent reranker that perhaps weights different ranking scores based on context
[2024-05-10, 09:57:05] Nirant K: I didn't quite get you? The ranks are always identical in a sorted list?
[2024-05-10, 09:57:37] Paras Chopra Wingify: For the same result Bm2.5 score will be different vs semantic score, right?
[2024-05-10, 09:57:49] Nirant K: That's how ensembling models work — and they're too slow for Internet. Batch processes do use learned re-rankers
[2024-05-10, 09:58:12] Nirant K: The scores don't matter (in RRF) — only the relative ordering matters
[2024-05-10, 09:58:50] Paras Chopra Wingify: Implicitly it is giving equal rights to different ranks right?
[2024-05-10, 09:58:59] Paras Chopra Wingify: Weights *
[2024-05-10, 09:59:44] Nirant K: Not really. Scoring has been irrelevant since the beginning in IR. Ranks are all that matter?
[2024-05-10, 10:00:34] Nirant K: FWIW Weighted Condorcet allows you to score each ranker/candidate generation approach
[2024-05-10, 10:01:08] Paras Chopra Wingify: Not sure I’m able to get intuition of this

Let’s say for a search result X for query Y, BM2.5 ranks it A and semantic  ranks it B

RRF is blind to X and Y, and hence context 

Shouldn’t that matter?
[2024-05-10, 10:02:59] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: RRF adds latency and context size but kind of increase accuracy for high performance systems
[2024-05-10, 10:03:24] Nirant K: RRF works on query result level — so it's aware of X.

As to, does Y matter? Do contents of A and B matter? Yes.

We use cross-encoders to factor that in — but they do pairwise computation. Making them slow for large lists.
[2024-05-10, 10:03:59] Nirant K: It's not that much of an overhead. Most BM25 systems like Elastic implementations are slower
[2024-05-10, 10:04:38] Paras Chopra Wingify: I suspect you can distill a cross encoder into a simple 1 layer network which through matmul could be a super fast reranker
[2024-05-10, 10:05:33] Nirant K: Yes. I shared your suspicion and tried this. Couldn't get it to be general enough to be useful
[2024-05-10, 10:05:40] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I thought BM25+reranking is already part of this flow, usually you would do them before RRF. Correct me if I’m wrong, you deal with more examples.
[2024-05-10, 10:07:07] Nirant K: The common wisdom in IR today is to avoid multi-stage if you have money. Just do parallel non-blocking calls across dense, sparse, multi-vec and combine them. If you get better results later, just add them to the scroll later in the feed.
[2024-05-10, 10:07:19] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: And RRF requires an extra LLM call which is kind of a bummer in terms of production consistency
[2024-05-10, 10:07:46] Nirant K: What. No. It's strictly deterministic? There's no LLM call?
[2024-05-10, 10:09:12] Priyesh OnFinance: We do this but its still probabilistic na?
[2024-05-10, 10:09:39] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Im doing an LLM call to find similar search queries before retrieval with some extra context 😁
[2024-05-10, 10:09:44] Paras Chopra Wingify: This is deterministic

[2024-05-10, 10:11:36] Nirant K: Adding RRF doesn't need you to change anything in this flow. Just call your search as earlier in parallel.
[2024-05-10, 10:13:27] Nirant K: If someone is willing to help with editing and review, can write a primer on modern search for AI engineers: how to select an embedding model, why we need it, where it struggles, multi-vec (ColBERT) and fusion vs reranker. 
[2024-05-10, 10:13:37] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I’m doing 4 of these in parallel, where 4 variants of queries are created from original one, where I use LLM. I guess theoretically not part of RRF
[2024-05-10, 10:13:54] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I can help review
[2024-05-10, 10:14:05] Nirant K: Yeah, query expansion is the slang for this
[2024-05-10, 10:14:29] Nirant K: Will still need someone to edit and organize 😅

[2024-05-10, 23:06:47] Kashyap Kompella: *Does Fine-Tuning LLMs on New Knowledge Encourage Hallucinations?*

Interesting, new paper from Google — 

The authors study ‘the impact of exposure to new knowledge on the capability of the fine-tuned model to utilize its pre-existing knowledge’.

They say that their ‘results highlight the risk in introducing new factual knowledge through fine-tuning, and support the view that large language models mostly acquire factual knowledge through pre-training, whereas fine-tuning teaches them to use it more efficiently’

[2024-05-11, 13:13:14] C Chaitanya: The main problem is that the market size of indic LLMs is smaller compared to English. Maybe Hindi has a market. So one approach I am supporting is working with free software/open source organizations. Coming up with a model of collecting data responsibly, using the community and creating the right licenses. The next step is to create the models. I think there are enough fine tuning efforts, but we are trying to do a from scratch approach to Telugu. Will start this after the data collection is completed by July hopefully. Indic languages have a whole host of problems starting with tokenization. Even data collection is a problem because the input keyboards etc are not optimized for our languages. We hope to have a lot of learnings in the coming few months and will hope to share those learnings soon.
[2024-05-11, 13:16:31] Nirant K: What's the market ratio of English to Hindi in your usage data @919819046942 ?
[2024-05-11, 13:20:25] C Chaitanya: The current data collection effort we are doing in 3 phases. First phase 10,000 students have signed up and will start data collection from May 21st. Second phase will be 30,000 students and final phase will be 60,000 students
[2024-05-11, 13:20:59] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Hence data collection is not the most fruitful way. You will need roughly 2-3T tokens per language really to make a dent. This data will also need a massive amount of diversity. Code, articles, long context, all of what we see in english. Synthetic data is the only way to scale to this.
[2024-05-11, 13:21:46] Nirant K: ❤️‍🔥
[2024-05-11, 13:21:59] Nirant K: Emoji for it hurts,but it's true
[2024-05-11, 13:24:13] C Chaitanya: Might be. But even to bootstrap it might be worth it to collect a dataset which is open source and people can experiment freely and maybe use asa  base to create synthetic data too.
That said synthetic data has its own set of problems.
The advantage of an open source dataset is that people can experiment freely and see what works etc without worry about copyright

[2024-05-11, 13:32:33] C Chaitanya: We can try and add as per license. The goal is multi fold. Setup a process for community oriented data collection. Train students in ML tools for data collection, data cleaning and  then later model training and tuning. Getting the workforce ready too :)
[2024-05-11, 13:33:58] C Chaitanya: That's absolutely one way and I hope someone does it and releases the dataset in open source.

[2024-05-11, 13:39:39] Jacob Singh: This is where I don’t understand the indic language LLM investment. Hindi probably has more in common with English than Tamil. So you’re talking about full re-investment for every language + I don’t know where the revenue pools are to support it. Maybe Telco 🤷‍♂️
[2024-05-11, 13:43:52] Aashay Sachdeva MPL Data Scientist: Having a good base model multilingual model doesn’t hurt. Multiple research there to support it makes the model more robust and better.The investment, compared to general compute requirements, is minimal.

[2024-05-12, 02:08:14] Avijit Thawani: if its literally these two lists, just paste into your llm of choice. for much longer lists, the old school way would be to find closest matching string eg edit distance etc (or semantically by embedding). but again better to just validate some llm performance and save yourself a couple hrs in exchange of a few cents.

[2024-05-12, 07:15:10] ~ Aravind Putrevu: Exactly. But we should aspire to build systems to collect that data. Unlike say a language like Dutch (which has less speakers) and economically expensive to create datasets, we have an advantage creating real data. Maybe a hybrid approach would work too.
[2024-05-12, 07:15:56] ~ Aravind Putrevu: Using something like Refuel.ai, we could build a automated process to collect and pay for data generated.

[2024-05-12, 08:31:15] Edgar Monis Mumbai WHO: Use semantic caching for user queries if applicable

Use caching for the search step

Ask the model to return concise responses

[2024-05-12, 17:52:19] Paras Chopra Wingify: Here’s an idea.

Has anyone tried giving code-generating LLM a notebook-like environment, where one line of code is output and executed at a time, its feedback is inspected and fed back and only then the next line is output 

I’m saying this because I’m noticing lots of subtle errors when LLMs generate long pieces of code 

I know some agents feed back the output, but it is often big chunks of code not an individual line

I suspect a note book like environment for an LLM can allow solution of novel problems
[2024-05-12, 17:58:49] Soham (Composio.dev): https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent

At the code execution level, doing it line by line is only possible in small projects in specific languages. But even in large pieces of code generation, there are multiple ways to improve it with a very similar approach. 

One of the core innovations they did was something like this. The edit command (when LLM is used to generate code, checks the indentation end-to-end and rejects the edits if the code is not indented properly). 

Paper Link: https://swe-agent.com/paper.pdf
[2024-05-12, 18:00:43] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: wouldn't it be very annoying? My workflow currently is asking chatgpt to generate code, copy paste it in the IDE and run it. I don't like github copilot's way of generating code without hearing my instructions. So, to solve this, I started using cursor. I felt cursor was extremely slow even with their premium plan. Why was it slow (and annoying)? 1. It first generated code in chat section 2. one needed to click on apply and then it took some more time to apply it in the code file 3. one has to accept the changes line by line. Now, I am back to asking chatgpt and doing back and forth between browser and IDE. It's time consuming, but so far the best workflow for me. I think if the code is being generated line by line after inspection, it would take a lot of time. while, subtle errors can be fixed manually as well.
[2024-05-12, 18:15:56] Paras Chopra Wingify: I feel it can be a great UX too, where humans can intervene at any point 

Also give LLM the ability to inspect variable states 

I agree this isn’t good for problem oriented code like give me a sorting algo

But for more open ended problems like here’s the data, tell me what’s interesting about it

This might be a good way

So why doesn't the chat interface work in this case? even if it's a case like tell me something interesting about this data? I am still trying to imagine how notebook experience would be different
[2024-05-12, 18:53:13] C Chaitanya: Working on this. This was the core premise on which Innings2 books was made. In this day and age textbooks can be made interactive. So, the CBSE math syllabus was made interactive.

How to output relevant properties to queries like "show me 2bhk flats in Indiranagar"
[2024-05-12, 21:42:45] ~ Ritz: If you are using python then read the CSV data into data frame and ask LLM to generate query which can be execute in pandas query
[2024-05-12, 21:43:20] ~ Ritz: Or you can also leverage function calling using langchain to get the relevant data
[2024-05-12, 21:45:15] Nirant K: Tip: LLMs are trained to write SQL but not pandas queries. So throw your data into a SQLite/DuckDB.

Querying it works more robustly than csv/pandas in my limites experience ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-12, 21:49:39] Sankalp Shubham: + then possibly use something like this
https://github.com/defog-ai/sqlcoder
[2024-05-12, 21:49:48] ~ ~I: that's not a very generalisable approach i believe 
As for queries like "is property X fire resistant?"
this approach breaks down

as this data comes in property details which is not very structured
[2024-05-12, 21:50:48] Sankalp Shubham: dumb question but why not just make documents out of data and then do the semantic search way
[2024-05-12, 21:51:04] ~ Abhinash Khare: Is your data mostly categorical /numerical or some of the columns can be sentences (ex: address)
[2024-05-12, 21:51:41] ~ ~I: both actually 
some are even list like amenties
[2024-05-12, 21:55:48] ~ ~I: that hasn't given good results 

main reason: hard to find the relevant contexts with semantic search as its looking for a very specific information many times and thus fail to find(trying hybrid search but doesn't seem very promising either) ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-05-12, 22:27:54] ~ Anukul Kumar: https://dspy.ai/docs/deep-dive/modules/program-of-thought

there is a paper/technique on similar lines called program of thought. Idea seems quite similar to me that you generate small chunk of code stepwise and revaluate next step.
[2024-05-12, 22:33:41] Vetrivel PS: +1
[2024-05-12, 23:00:22] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: The idea can be generalized as having a state machine, where the LLM can be guided to the right response by moving back to a previous state with feedback from the previous generation. It doesn’t need to be a notebook environment.
[2024-05-12, 23:15:46] Paras Chopra Wingify: Yep, actually several branches can be explored and then back tracked
[2024-05-12, 23:22:48] ~ Mahesh Sathiamoorthy: You can try this. https://python.langchain.com/v0.1/docs/modules/data_connection/document_transformers/semantic-chunker/

But I wasn't quite happy with it because it was producing a lot of very small chunks in my case.

So I first used it and concatenated small chunks.
[2024-05-12, 23:24:00] ~ Mahesh Sathiamoorthy: The above is a response to this question.
[2024-05-12, 23:29:20] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: Have you tried grid search with some kind of eval? That’s what we use and works well.
[2024-05-12, 23:33:07] ~ Mahesh Sathiamoorthy: +1.
If you are measuring recall, chunk size can be a hyperparameter.
[2024-05-12, 23:49:39] Diptanu Choudhury FB AI: Often naive recursive chunking, or chunking with overlap is enough and performs as well as semantic chunking. I would try to look at the evals side by side before zeroing in on semantic chunking.
[2024-05-13, 00:09:05] ~ Mahesh Sathiamoorthy: What metrics do you use for eval?
[2024-05-13, 00:16:13] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: You should evaluate retrieval accuracy on topk, and then truthfulness of prompt response. 

Gold datasets to eval would take manual effort / money, but I recommend it out of interest of having the eval data be as close to your production field as possible. So co-creating datasets with customers is a great plus. 

Post data gathering, retrieval eval can be automated ofcourse, but might be best to have LLM output evals done manually (Gold evals). You could also get Claude Opus / GPT4 to evaluate ( Ragas - Silver evals ), but the most reliable data from our experience is still gold in nature aka man made. Hope this helps!
[2024-05-13, 08:59:36] Nirant K: Times FM: Time Series Forecasting Model from Google Research. Apache License. Ships with its own inference library. 

Key points:

1. It performs univariate time series forecasting for context lengths up to 512 time points and any horizon lengths, with an optional frequency indicator.
2. It focuses on point forecasts and does not support probabilistic forecasts.
3. It requires the context to be contiguous (i.e. no "holes"), and the context and the horizon to be of the same frequency.

I think the last one will severely limit lot of demand forecasting problems, but good toy to play with at 200M!

[2024-05-13, 10:42:34] ~ Tanmay Sachan: keeping cores of whatever hardware you have always fed is just always true.

The authors built an abstraction on top of CUDA that’s faster by taking advantage of instructions that are specific to H100.
A lot of times building things straight with base CUDA (hoping compiler optimizes it all the way) might not be that efficient since CUDA is quite general purpose.
[2024-05-13, 10:42:35] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: @919892727514 may be you can add some stuff here
[2024-05-13, 10:44:18] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: OK here's the deal: Cuda is just a language, writing kernels in Cuda is a whole different problem. The biggest problem you're solving when writing a kernel is keeping the controller fed.
[2024-05-13, 10:46:39] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: The difficulty of keeping the controller fed is memory hierarchy. And surprisingly for me this problem is not unique to GPU. Even single core CPU has the same problem.
[2024-05-13, 10:47:16] Paras Chopra Wingify: What was 16x16 matrix about? I didn’t get that

[2024-05-13, 10:49:49] ~ Tanmay Sachan: Are you talking about 3 nested loops for matmul?
[2024-05-13, 10:50:49] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: Ok systolic arrays. These are different type of instructions that take in matrices instead of standard vectors. But the underlying principle is all about keep the controller fed.
[2024-05-13, 10:51:42] ~ Sandya Saravanan: CUDA embedded DSL to handle tiled matrix multiply, unlike Triton which is also a tiled DSL but outside CUDA, so you need a compiler from triton to CUDA..   The most interesting part is their argument that AI code is mainly 16X16 MMs and that instead of single dimensional vector registers, they are a pitching a 16x16 vector register tile itself...
[2024-05-13, 10:51:49] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: Naive matmul = 3 nested for loops. Doesn't keep the controller fed. 6/7 nested loops are required to actually having the controller used to full utilization
[2024-05-13, 10:51:55] ~ Tanmay Sachan: It’s a really hard problem to solve with compilers, to optimize it you need stuff like polyhedral analysis to obtain bounds on the loops (slightly out of my depth here)
[2024-05-13, 10:52:13] ~ Tanmay Sachan: look into MLIR and their affine loops
[2024-05-13, 10:52:42] ~ Tanmay Sachan: yes, and its not easy from a compilation POV
[2024-05-13, 10:52:43] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: Correct. I manually could do it. I know how to automate it. Written some code on the problem already.
[2024-05-13, 10:53:29] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: Yes. Systolic arrays. It makes sense.
[2024-05-13, 10:54:27] Karthik S Delhivery: anyone compared this with LagLlama (https://github.com/time-series-foundation-models/lag-llama) or TimeGPT (https://docs.nixtla.io) ?
[2024-05-13, 10:54:59] ~ Tanmay Sachan: Try writing the same loops again in C++, but use this to compile

clang -O3 -mllvm -polly file.c
[2024-05-13, 10:55:06] Sasank Chilamkurthy QureAI, PyTorch: If you read BLIS paper, it's actually much clearer than what's explained in this blog. There are two parts: micro kernel and macro kernel. Micro kernel better be fixed instruction set. Macro kernel is the DSL they're talking about.

[2024-05-13, 12:22:41] Cheril Chicago Human+AI: hi had a silly doubt regarding azure open ai quotas say I have been allotted a quota ok 350K tokens per minute for embeddings does this mean in 2 minutes I can process 700K tokens or total of 350 only? asking this as my usage is being shown far above how much I as estimating (have processed just one pdf of 50 pages and it shows 150 units used). If anyone has used this what is the average usage you have seen?

As the open ai assistant answer the user query, it should suggest couple of followup questions too that user can ask. 

I tried tweaking the prompt but its not sending.
[2024-05-13, 18:50:21] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Two separate LLM calls
[2024-05-13, 18:51:34] ~ Ankur Khandelwal: second will be chat completion one right? not the assistant one

I added “suggest the followup questions after replying to the user query” but that didn’t worked.

[2024-05-13, 19:03:37] Lavish 2017: hey folks, any deterministic way to remove / avoid “here is your answer” and variations of the same in output?

I did 20K calls and still have 50 outputs with these lines and am already removing all common texts manually in code and prompt iterated to my maximum
[2024-05-13, 19:12:37] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: System prompt?
[2024-05-13, 19:13:09] Priyank Agrawal: i have the same issue, for me its “assist” ——
[2024-05-13, 19:18:55] Lavish 2017: have delved into avoiding this with prompt as much as possible
[2024-05-13, 19:19:52] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: ok
[2024-05-13, 19:26:59] ~ Priyankar Kumar: Difficult to say without seeing the prompt or knowing the model 😅. Maybe you have already checked for these-
- do you provide any examples where the answers start with phrases along similar lines?
- did you ask it not to add such phrases? I know it'll sound like a gimmick but even the format of the rule can sometimes make it follow it sincerely. Like, make the rule all caps or make parts of it bold to emphasize that it MUST follow the rule
[2024-05-13, 19:33:32] ~ Vinay Mimani: ‎This message was deleted.
[2024-05-13, 19:50:11] ~ ~I: have you tried JSON mode?

also one other trick that works for me is to add at the end 

"Response(with the given instructions):"
[2024-05-13, 20:00:09] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: apparently. it's not working for bulk. 50/2K has "here's answer or variation"

[2024-05-13, 22:43:10] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Most of these voice notes companies (I know personally one) were winning from lack of knowledge with naive consumers and so get to 5-10k mrr quite quickly using ads for distribution. Mid term they were to be killed and Apple is working on a similar feature
[2024-05-13, 22:43:46] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: Emotions TTS such as play.ht are gone. 11labs? 🥸

[2024-05-13, 22:49:13] Nitin Mahajan McKinsey: After sora exposures, yes everything is to be taken with moderation 

But this one I think will stabilize soon (unlike sora which has other issues). In 1-2 months this voice stuff will be “production” grade perhaps but if cost is anyways much cheaper than 11labs lots will start playing
[2024-05-13, 22:49:50] ~ Anuruddh: It’s connected to the internet via a wire.
[2024-05-13, 22:50:29] ~ Atishay: cost is 50% cheaper than 4-T

no voice modal here?
[2024-05-13, 23:58:05] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: What is USP left for Krutrim and Hanooman, general purpose consumer platform, if OpenAI is going to start supporting Indic languages?
[2024-05-13, 23:58:09] Adithya S K PESIT: I get how its taking multimodal inputs but any ideas on how it can natively give multi model outputs without using other models?
[2024-05-13, 23:59:10] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Sirji krutrim was never doing what it said it was doing anyway. It is just a marketing platform
[2024-05-13, 23:59:19] Rahul Deora: True. They made a heavy push this time
[2024-05-14, 00:00:33] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: No idea. We can always ask @17327816866 for clarification. He has a busy day today, so I would expect him to respond probably in coming days 😁 ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-14, 00:02:07] Jithin James: this that is not in the API as of today I think

> Since GPT-4o in the API does not yet support audio-in (as of May 2024), we'll use a combination of GPT-4o and Whisper to process both the audio and visual for a provided video, and showcase two usecases:

so I'm guessing recreating the demo is not quite possible then? ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-14, 00:03:00] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Probably, it may take time like Vision and rate limited even after that for sometime.
[2024-05-14, 00:03:50] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Meanwhile, all open source bros will hack around to integrate audio as input to nn
[2024-05-14, 00:04:08] Atik Shaikh: So Perplexity is not killed yet 💀 

Many guys expected the search.chatgpt.com 👀
[2024-05-14, 00:04:59] ~ Srinivasan Nandakumar: In a way you being able to share the screen with chat gpt desktop does that no
[2024-05-14, 00:05:03] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: If they didn’t go after it, that’s a bad sign for perplexity. May be 🤷‍♂️
[2024-05-14, 00:05:15] Jaskaran Dubverse: It uses a got like model to take input and output in another modalitiea tokens
For text it uses text tokenizer to tokenize and detokenize.
For image it might be using clip to tokenize and diffusion model to going back to image from tokens (Dalle2)
For audio wav2vec is used to tokenize and diffusion model to go from tokens to audio(tortoise tts) (im working on this too :)
This was published first in audiopalm by google
[2024-05-14, 00:06:38] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: OpenAI already hired the brain behind tortoise.
[2024-05-14, 00:07:08] Jithin James: what would be some hacks OSS bros might do?
do you have to made modifications to the embeddings layers?

if you do have any resources do share, would be really grateful 🙂
all I had was this https://arxiv.org/pdf/2206.06488
[2024-05-14, 00:08:50] Atik Shaikh: Still Perplexity have more usecases like having specific focus modes and some new features like pages. They’re trying to introduce new things now
[2024-05-14, 00:10:09] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I think first start would be audioML and audio input as token. That would be amazing. I’ll share here something that I find from OSS Bros network 😂
[2024-05-14, 00:10:42] ~ Anirudh Pupneja: https://unified-io.allenai.org/

I think this is a nice early example of what you're referring to. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-14, 00:11:43] Adithya S K PESIT: Taking the audio modality into consideration is it an auto regressive model and how is it generating real time audio
[2024-05-14, 00:12:05] Anubhav mishra Zupay: https://x.com/gdb/status/1790071008499544518
[2024-05-14, 00:12:13] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Oh boy. Thrilling
[2024-05-14, 00:15:14] Jaskaran Dubverse: it predicts audio tokens from tokenized text/audio/image , audio tokens carries linguistic information along with emotional and prosidy information, these audio tokens are then feed into a diffusion/Gan model to generate the audio/speech back from the tokens given a speaker embedding. you can read about tortoise tts or Bark model
[2024-05-14, 00:17:16] ~ Sukuru Sai Vineet: how does the model route between audio, text and image outputs consistently since their output modalities are different? Just good training or some deterministic method?
[2024-05-14, 00:17:57] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: They have added web search to free ChatGPT. I think they are just delaying
[2024-05-14, 00:19:28] Anubhav mishra Zupay: https://x.com/karpathy/status/1790076925508977096?s=46

It was karaoathys last project at OAI
[2024-05-14, 00:20:02] Jaskaran Dubverse: In audio palm they would send out a key token to let the model know the modality output.
[2024-05-14, 00:20:10] ~ Karan Danthi: Why are they delaying ?
[2024-05-14, 00:20:11] ~ Karan Danthi: Cost ?
[2024-05-14, 00:20:22] ~ Karan Danthi: Would be too expensive to compete is my guess
[2024-05-14, 00:22:05] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: According to doc, you can select output modality at api level. I guess this will be clue instead of some thing complex
[2024-05-14, 00:22:33] Priyesh OnFinance: Agreed
[2024-05-14, 00:23:01] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: Not for OpenAI
[2024-05-14, 00:23:17] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Can anyone explain how gpt4o is streaming a video to a transformer is realtime ? Is it tokenization or system optimisation in general
[2024-05-14, 00:23:21] Jaskaran Dubverse: I think it'll be similar as in case of whisper, translate/transcription mode
[2024-05-14, 00:24:17] ~ Karan Danthi: Great question
[2024-05-14, 00:24:39] Rajesh Kumar SA : Mostly system optimisation. Not that hard. Video does hallucinate quite a bit but they managed well in the demoes
[2024-05-14, 00:24:40] ~ Narayan Sharma: How certain are we of this? I mean now that we are certain 4o doesn't yet support audio in? 

Also wrt to products like hume, playht — how could one deterministically evaluate performance specially wrt emoting?
[2024-05-14, 00:25:43] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Someone should check Indic OCR with gpt4-o vision.
[2024-05-14, 00:26:34] ~ Mahesh Sathiamoorthy: It’s a combination of both system optimization and a multimodal transformer model.
Likely the inputs to the transformer models are embedding vectors of videos (as opposed to tokens).
[2024-05-14, 00:26:41] ~ Mahesh Sathiamoorthy: (that’s just my educated guess) ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-14, 00:26:44] ~ Karan Danthi: How does the phone process all this
[2024-05-14, 00:27:27] ~ Narayan Sharma: The compute can't reside on the chip (I guess?)
[2024-05-14, 00:27:52] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Another great use of video streaming ,is unlocking real time screen sharing use case 

So so many educational AI tutors can be built like this

[2024-05-14, 00:28:07] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: More web search features or maybe a separate app (search.openai.com). I think they will just add more search features into ChatGPT
[2024-05-14, 00:28:23] ~ Aravind Putrevu: Better Byjus 😀
[2024-05-14, 00:28:29] Adarsh GenAI WhatsApp Group: Best bet is it's a multimodal projector that embeds the video realtime and streams it into the llm as logits. 

Similar to llava actually. You can train various projectors and have all your modalities projected onto a single embedding space.

Here's a fun paper to read on this:
https://arxiv.org/abs/2309.16058
[2024-05-14, 00:28:38] Rahul Deora: Agent route is just a hack, you can pass in embeddings of voice/video and during output there can be a output token depicting modality index
[2024-05-14, 00:30:42] Anubhav mishra Zupay: But won’t you need some insanely high quality data for this? What would be the sources of such

[2024-05-14, 00:37:14] ~ Sid: OpenAPI seems to be very clever in their data acquisition strategy. They had the original voice to text to voice mode available on their app since the last few months. With 100 million or so users, it would have been a golden dataset to train the Omni model.
[2024-05-14, 00:37:16] ~ Narayan Sharma: Ah my bad, guess the inferencing doesn't allow audio-in as of now, hence the talk about not being able to recreate the demo. Anyhow, this is pretty celebratory!
[2024-05-14, 00:37:21] Hemant Mohapatra: https://x.com/DrJimFan/status/1790089671365767313 pretty good look under the good. Seems directionally correct and checked this with the audio LLM/ASR team at FAIR ("this is how I'd do it")

https://x.com/MattLCapon/status/1790072865758339468
When first asked, GPT responds with data from a previous frame. And then also it responds with data about one frame rather than a video description. Unless we get hands on the product and do some experiments, we can just hypthesize I guess :)
[2024-05-14, 00:54:09] Anubhav mishra Zupay: Share screen with ChatGPT and allow it to operate it for you like anydesk lol would be crazy

[2024-05-14, 01:00:00] ~ Sukuru Sai Vineet: does 4o have function calling?
[2024-05-14, 01:00:20] Vrushank Vyas: yep, and JSON mode

[2024-05-14, 01:18:11] ~ Sri Krishna: more fun stuff with gpt4o lol https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MirzFk_DSiI
[2024-05-14, 01:18:35] ~ Palash: Let me try
This was on Android
[2024-05-14, 01:21:08] ~ Palash: Please send a screen recording here for everyone?
[2024-05-14, 01:45:47] Vamshi: This is fantastic. GPT4o refused to sing for me though.
Says I can’t “actually” sing.
[2024-05-14, 01:47:22] Vamshi: But voice chat is super fast and feels, for the first time, as much of a game changer from an end consumer perspective as ChatGPT itself.
[2024-05-14, 01:49:29] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: So how do we do RAG on audio in/out mode? We need audio vector embeddings models now 😂
[2024-05-14, 02:06:26] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Wait what about seq 2 seq models ka first layer
[2024-05-14, 02:08:43] Ritesh Invideo Nilenso: I am wondering if the cost reduction is simply because the model has become faster that automatically reduces the time one query spends on gpu compute. So if gpt-4o is 2x faster but requiring same compute and memory then it's automatically 2x cheaper as well.  Wdyt?
[2024-05-14, 02:09:49] Abhishek Mishra: much efficient tokenizer and likely smaller model with similar capabilities as gpt4
[2024-05-14, 02:09:50] Abhishek Mishra: so it gets cheaper for them a lot too
[2024-05-14, 02:10:49] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: GPT5 quantized version??

[2024-05-14, 02:25:37] Abhishek Mishra: more likely to be a key component for MoE GPT5, they trained it as a 3 modality model from scratch
‎[2024-05-14, 02:28:01] Rishi GenAI Group: ‎image omitted
[2024-05-14, 02:29:09] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Of course MoE and selective quantization for expert layer. OpenAI has full control to what they want to expose at the API end.
[2024-05-14, 02:32:39] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: The faster and cheaper cost kind of reflective of smaller model at inference level as nothing has changed drastically at the GPU and energy cost level. While improved efficiency points at a completely new model weight.

[2024-05-14, 06:35:33] Shan: Dumb question- why should I continue to pay for chat gpt plus now if 4o is available to all for free. Am I missing something here?

[2024-05-14, 06:54:30] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Are they doomed?
[2024-05-14, 06:56:15] Aakash Dharmadhikari: Businesses are a lot more than just their models. So depends on what other aspects they excelled at.
[2024-05-14, 06:56:35] Aakash Dharmadhikari: May be a better framing is that the comic strip generation capability is now democratized.
[2024-05-14, 06:56:50] Atik Shaikh: Higher limits also new update isnt out for free users yet
[2024-05-14, 06:57:01] Aakash Dharmadhikari: So expect a lot more competitors

[2024-05-14, 07:26:06] Aakash Dharmadhikari: do you believe directionally it can get to being a yet another GPT on the OpenAI platform, or you see a structural reason why OpenAI can’t commoditize the base model?
[2024-05-14, 07:26:16] Aakash Dharmadhikari: Just curious

[2024-05-14, 08:32:39] C Chaitanya: No, it did output images as you can see in the examples above.
[2024-05-14, 08:32:57] C Chaitanya: But it has the same character consistency problem like other models.
[2024-05-14, 08:32:59] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: From second onwards, it is staying on the course.

[2024-05-14, 08:47:39] Shan: I’m gonna pay for this month but if it’s just a message limit in the app then maybe I’m not the target audience. Let’s see how much I end up using with the new modalities…

[2024-05-14, 09:27:10] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: I think its
Not prosumer level.. won’t  deliver for that specific a prompt
[2024-05-14, 09:28:27] C Chaitanya: I tried to do something similar to what Jim did. Not much change. Anyway, just an observation
[2024-05-14, 09:29:01] Shubham Sharma 2012C6: Yeah i think if the first image has blue tie and shorts try not specificying all that in the second prompt?

[2024-05-14, 09:36:41] C Chaitanya: I used the same. Trying to see if my prompting is wrong.
[2024-05-14, 09:42:32] C Chaitanya: Two months is a good timeline, given that OpenAI also has not released the demo version to the public yet. I am guessing they will also take around 2 months to release it.

Thanks!
[2024-05-14, 12:29:25] Rajaswa Patil: We are not using TPUs, but we do see ~25% reduction in response times as compared to OpenAI.

Do you need even further optimization?
[2024-05-14, 12:36:58] ~ Aravind Putrevu: Lol, I cancelled ChatGPT plus a month ago for Claude, now back to square one.
[2024-05-14, 12:40:23] ~ Sayan: Gpt 4 turbo is now  GA in 2 regions. They have better latencies
[2024-05-14, 12:44:51] ~ Sayan: this is 3.5 or 4 ?
[2024-05-14, 12:47:38] Rajaswa Patil: Primarily 3.5 ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-14, 12:48:27] ~ Sayan: yeah, experience with 4 on azure has been really bad till now.
[2024-05-14, 12:48:57] ~ Sayan: with 4-turbo in ga its better
[2024-05-14, 12:51:04] ~ Hadi Khan: I've been wanting to make the same move but held on to ChatGPT plus in anticipation of gpt5
[2024-05-14, 13:05:26] Ruchir GenAI Security: if I dont use custom GPTs, is there any reason to continue paying for ChatGPT plus?
[2024-05-14, 13:06:52] ~ Palash: if your usage is high, then you will cross GPT-4o limits pretty easily
in that case, you will need to pay

for low usage, infrequent
may be not
[2024-05-14, 13:09:25] ~ Pathik Ghugare: Damn 
I'm seeing 50% increase in my response times 🫣
How did you optimise your Azure OpenAI deployment?
[2024-05-14, 13:11:05] ~ Milan Chheda: Same here. We are seeing increase in response times. OpenAI still performing better over Azure.
[2024-05-14, 13:25:01] Vamshi: I held on too for coding assistance.

GPT4o feels noticeably faster obviously, but it still “bails out” and escapes on coding tasks in a way that still makes it frustrating.
I know that I can get it to work with significant hand holding, but I wonder what’s the rationale for this user experience.
I would prefer, as an end customer, for less bailing out, even if I’m charged for it.

Would be nice to hear any approaches from others that result in better results, other than rolling your own interface using the API.
[2024-05-14, 13:25:40] Shanoop Krishnan Microsoft Sales: It will get better post GA. You must be seeing an uptick already.
[2024-05-14, 13:28:38] Vamshi: Especially with the higher limits and lower cost now, I thought they would tweak the “bail out” point to be much higher up.
[2024-05-14, 13:29:14] ~ Sayan: Yes. It's already in GA in 2 region afaik
[2024-05-14, 13:31:02] ~ Hadi Khan: Yeah for coding I believe custom GPTs is an underrated feature. Many 3rd party custom GPTs are decent plus with a new tech, you can give the documentation as knowledge base.

Made a little python script to create a master PDF of documentation files in markdown.

[2024-05-14, 13:50:18] ~ Hadi Khan: Yes! I helped my cousin prepare his research proposal. Tested on multiple AI detectors myself and it eventually passed turnitin AI detection at his uni as well.

Would greatly appreciate your help
[2024-05-14, 13:51:50] ~ Hadi Khan: Basically you play around with parameters like TopP, Frequency Penalty, Presence Penalty.

If you need an interface use OpenAI playground, else you'll have to do it via the API endpoint

[2024-05-14, 15:26:50] Rahul Deora: GPT4o is basically half the cost of GPT4-turbo but still 10 times the cost of GPT3.5-turbo. Is anyone planning to switch to GPT4o realistically? Or is it mostly meant for GPT4 users
[2024-05-14, 15:27:19] Rahul Deora: Am assuming most people use 3.5 turbo
[2024-05-14, 15:27:30] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: If you're running a business and making 3x margins, you won't go for 10x gpt-4o

[2024-05-14, 15:30:03] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Ya open mixtral is cheaper and much better quality than 3.5 turbo and still cheaper then gpt4 o.
 Although gpt 3.5 turbo is cheaper.

[2024-05-14, 17:35:09] C Chaitanya: This is one reason I believe we won't see multi modal released to the public anytime soon.

They mentioned one native audio model..and the laughs and all dosen't indicate that either
[2024-05-14, 17:46:52] C Chaitanya: It's not a TTS. They say it's audio tokens to audio tokens. Not sure how you can put guardrails in this pipeline

2. Confusion regarding database structure - How to find correct column for querying
3. Problems arising due to case sensitivity of search items
Can somebody guide me how to solve these problems. These may be having simple solutions well but I am getting stuck at these.
[2024-05-14, 22:07:57] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: For 1/2: pass the schema and relationships between the attributes as a few shot prompt. This increases cost of input tokens, but the performance improvement is great.

For 3, I'm assuming you're looking at PII or sensitive data, data scrubbing pre/post processing is a good approach to take.
[2024-05-14, 22:13:26] Sankalp Shubham: https://x.com/ArtificialAnlys/status/1790419257752490157

[2024-05-15, 08:49:22] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I think OpenAI looked more interesting overall. Google's problem is the tendency to shutter promising features because of their army of PMs that like killing stuff off. Obviously tech wise they're among the best.
[2024-05-15, 08:54:04] Atik Shaikh: As a developer I felt OAI event offered more but as a end user I feel the GEMINI workspace would save lots of hours for me personally so yeah it can be user preference but they also got the 1.5 Pro’s 1M context window directly in the Chat itself that also was a good one. Also “promised” 😂 to make it to 2M later
[2024-05-15, 09:04:02] Nirant K: I'd not use anything from Google in my production workloads — they might shut it down 6 months later
[2024-05-15, 09:05:04] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Yeah, some clients burned their hands with GCP - and this trend has been there since 2016-17, not at all recent. Clients I have seen since then come back to Azure or AWS
[2024-05-15, 09:05:25] Sai Udaan: Did they callout anything officially so far?

This has been going on for a while
[2024-05-15, 09:29:47] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: How do you handle such flows in cursor?

My codebase contains  two folders server and client

I often generate APIs in my server code using the cursor.

Post that I will go to my client code and create a function that calls the newly created api.

Both of them are done independently. 

How you guys are doing such work flows in which generation of code in one file requires and generation of code in another.

I have some ideas around automating it. Writing a watcher for the file in the server and passing the diff of the server file in LLM and asking it to generate the code that can be pasted in the client file and then doing a git patch or something it will insert the code.
[2024-05-15, 09:37:38] Atik Shaikh: Would prefer doing it manually 🤷‍♂️
[2024-05-15, 10:05:35] Harsh Gupta Felvin: I handle this flow manually as well
[2024-05-15, 10:05:50] Harsh Gupta Felvin: What's your solution and what will the interface look like?
[2024-05-15, 10:12:59] ~ Nithin: I usually pass the updated servee file as context and ask cursor to generate / update the client
[2024-05-15, 10:13:56] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Nice video. That tokenizer seems really interesting, and I wonder how they tackle sub-problems like languages in India that use a different script (Konkani and Kannada, Bhojpuri/Marathi and Hindi which use Devanagari, etc).
[2024-05-15, 10:17:39] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: I do this manually as of now. I think the automation would work if you are coding from scratch using AI where the first step would be to provide details of front end and back end. 

GitHub copilot solves it in some way (but only for one repo) i.e. if you change name of function or change file location it suggests you make necessary changes wherever that function is called or file is being imported, one has to just accept the changes.
[2024-05-15, 10:18:29] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: I think workflow where, front end or backend changes trigger an action to change code would be a good flow.
[2024-05-15, 10:26:46] ~ Mahesh Sathiamoorthy: This is cool. Does anyone know how is this being used?
[2024-05-15, 10:28:47] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: I am thinking to create a conf file which are kind of rules file like if this file changes pass the change to the LLM with the context and prompt and then finally output the change into this file
[2024-05-15, 10:29:37] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: There will be a watcher executable at listens to the changes and then invoke the rules from the conf file
[2024-05-15, 10:32:05] Rahul Bansal Rohtak: So you copy the updated code and generate the next code for a different file?

[2024-05-15, 22:12:46] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Don’t think this paper alludes to just western morals

It’s that any neural network trained on any set with any modality builds the same representation of reality.

I interpret it as they converge on same set of patterns and rules to represent reality irrespective of training data,modality etc 

Someone correct me if I’m wrong though..

[2024-05-16, 10:02:14] ~ Trinath Yarlagadda: I would suggest you to read the header and do a basic profiling on csv. Once you do that - then store the metadata of the csv and the profiling in rag. Does that make sense?
[2024-05-16, 10:02:29] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This is quite nice. Database lookup using natural language / conversational queries, which extends the Databricks paradigm where they want to use English to replace SQL. Can this be a replacement for using a vector DB, embedding model/endpoint and relational/other DB to build a RAG system?
[2024-05-16, 10:22:29] Rhythm Gupta IITD: Hi folks, wanted to understand cost structure of running llama2/3 on hosted instances. What concurrent queries can it serve? What configs work well etc..

[2024-05-16, 11:18:03] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: The way we optimised it  for our use case, if we had to do 300k queries on E2E cloud it would cost us about $1500 , a 65% cost reduction compared to using openAI for the LLM + embedding. It has other challenges though, only 8k context window meaning whatever end instruction you give with all the reference data should be < 6k words approximately

I’m hearing conflicting assessments
[2024-05-16, 23:10:29] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: When you say gpt4 do you mean the turbo version or og gpt4
[2024-05-16, 23:11:44] Paras Chopra Wingify: Hmm, either.
[2024-05-16, 23:12:54] Abhinav Verma Longshot.ai: Definitely better than OG based on usage with cursor and code suggestions in chatgpt, finding it similar to turbo so far which is a plus as it's cheaper on api

However need to be more precise with instructions
[2024-05-16, 23:17:15] Rachitt Shah GenAI WhatsApp Group: +1, need much better instructions for complex workflows but for simple usage like CLI commands on par with GPT-4/GPT-4T
[2024-05-16, 23:27:02] ~ Sunaje: Personally, found 4o much better with longer context coding task (~1000 lines), which 4T was mostly messing up.
[2024-05-16, 23:34:38] Paras Chopra Wingify: Was thinking it’s fascinating that scaling hypothesis is true both in biology and deep learning 

Brain mass ratio  is highly correlated across animals with intelligence, and in terms of energy consumption humans peak at 20% of total calories going to brain

So this has parallels to model size (brain size) and compute available (calories).

Perhaps intelligence is easily emergent given enough computation capacity in a high dimensional space (that inherently composed well)
[2024-05-16, 23:37:27] ~ Royal: Doubt that’s true in reasoning as much as it’s in predicting for deep learning models. Atleast it’s yet to be seen
[2024-05-16, 23:37:42] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Hmm bigger brains means more intelligence?
[2024-05-16, 23:39:54] Paras Chopra Wingify: Not just bigger brain (whale has the biggest one, but that’s because most of its neurons are dedicated to input-output since it has so many cells to coordinate in its large body)

But largest ratio of brain mass to body mass; which indicates largest number of “compute-only” neurons 

Indicentlly Jeff Hawkins also talks about this
[2024-05-16, 23:40:13] Paras Chopra Wingify: I also read even in humans brain size is correlated with IQ, which is fascinating
[2024-05-16, 23:40:26] Vipul Maheshwari: Never thought of *Protein* in the output

“every exponential is **at best** a sigmoid in disguise”

“This gets at one of the core debates about LLM capabilities — are they capable of extrapolation or do they only learn tasks represented in the training data? It's a glass half full / half empty situation and the truth is somewhere in between but I lean toward the latter view.”

With so many note taking apps out there, I figured this would be solved better.

He makes a good case as to why we still have a couple of orders of magnitude left, and I agree 

We can
- make more gpus (highly profitable right now so will attract investment)
- ⁠make faster compute (haven’t hit the limits)
- ⁠do algorithmic advances
- ⁠generate more data 

All of these will tap out somewhere but not right now

what is your opinion on this central point :
“This gets at one of the core debates about LLM capabilities — are they capable of extrapolation or do they only learn tasks represented in the training data? It's a glass half full / half empty situation and the truth is somewhere in between but I lean toward the latter view.”

Do LLMs have emergent task capabilities at scale, which may not be *represented* in the training data ?
[2024-05-17, 11:16:14] ~ Nithin: Deepgram models work well with good quality english and hindi and the output strucrure is good for most tasks. They also have a hosted whisper large model that has good transcription performance.

I am using aws transcribe for a few indic language use cases because there are not other reasonable alternatives.
[2024-05-17, 11:25:58] ~ Priyankar Kumar: Just curious, why not Azure Cognitive Services/Speech Studio, thought the speech models were one of Azures strengths (disclaimer: work at msft but genuine question) there's also Assembly AI which has good reviews but not something I've tried.
[2024-05-17, 11:39:14] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This is well known as a general paradigm of innovation - so-called S curves or sigmoids are more representative of incipience, growth and decay than exponential growth - the latter can only happen in mathematics, not in bounded physical systems, perhaps. TRIZ, which is a framework used to ideate and generate ideas from concepts discusses ideality in the context of S-curves or sigmoids.
[2024-05-17, 11:40:46] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Notions such as "Moore's law is slowing down" basically reinforce the same idea - we were at one point in a state of technology where there were disproportionate gains in performance or proportionate gains in performance - but using the same paradigm we may not see a consistent and proportionate gain in performance as we continue to use the same paradigm.
[2024-05-17, 11:41:23] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: This is why we need disruptive innovation, and why capitalist economies are innovation driven
[2024-05-17, 12:00:07] Vamshi: Long back we had a discussion on the group about Smokenskys tensor product representations, leading to ICS and the Rumelhart prize.

This was in the context of parallels to type systems and symbol binding.
[2024-05-17, 12:00:39] ~ Aditya Dalmia: I can second Azure's performance, it is quite good. Have benchmarked multiple providers for Indic and other low resource languages. As for diarization specifically, can give speechbrain a try if haven't already. We were using this in production and it worked quite great, as long as you set the parameters as per the required use case.

I just had to change few things which I did in UML code. and these changes were because my description was ambiguous.

[2024-05-17, 13:12:50] Paras Chopra Wingify: Well, I mean the debate about extrapolation is moot when you feed in tons of data in a domain

Even we are extrapolating - in a 4 dimensional world, we will fail miserably

[2024-05-17, 15:12:54] Jacob Singh: It’s basic stuff like this which demonstrates the inward gazing promotion driven culture of big tech.
[2024-05-17, 15:23:59] ~ Hadi Khan: I ran a little test yesterday across all popular LLMs with leetcode as the benchmark and using airtrain.ai 

Funny results. gpt4o was overdoing it by generating test cases. For easy problems Llama3 turned out to be the best (considering speed and cost as well).

But yeah with proper instructions gpt4o wins (atleast on leetcode 🫡) ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-05-17, 16:10:25] Abhishek Mishra: 4o iterates better and can do very well with one shot examples but it's quality is inferior to 4 overall and it's more discernible as the difficulty of problems gets higher.

the difficulty of problems here shouldn't be measured by how hard we perceive it or how it is rated on leetcode. It's to be measured by exposing models to a problem that you wouldn't find a direct solution of on the front page of Google and it also requires the model to take into account various edge cases.
[2024-05-17, 16:12:25] ~ Ashu: in my own opinion, gpt-4 O is not good in following complex instructions as compared to opus and gpt-4-turbo. 
tried few of my own prompts where the LLM have to go through a range of tasks step by step. 

gpt-4O is always eager to respond and can’t carry instructions well.

[2024-05-17, 20:40:38] Arnab Biswas: I spent some time comparing Whisper and Azure speech service around a year back. At that time Whisper had the tendency of hallucinating. It was in general performing better than Azure only when the audio quality is good. With external noise, Azure was better. 

But as I said it was a year back and I guess things might have changed in-between.
[2024-05-17, 20:56:26] ~ Pathik Ghugare: Anyone here done any analysis on gpt3.5/4 Vs llama3 series on your respective usecas in terms of latency, cost, metrics, etc. 
I wanted to know how these models scale as compared to closed ones

[2024-05-17, 21:15:11] ~ Anukul Kumar: for me 8k context limit has been quite limiting in terms of using llama70b extensively. In general it's much much better than gpt3.5 in terms of following instructions and not hallucinating.
[2024-05-17, 21:16:36] ~ Anukul Kumar: I am not sure if people have been able to increase context length with similar accuracy. Initial attempts of increasing context length were  bad in terms of accuracy.
[2024-05-17, 21:19:14] ~ Pathik Ghugare: And in terms of costing which one was better?

[2024-05-17, 21:36:52] Shan: This sounds awesome. Will try it out for some use cases I have. Any other packages like this?
[2024-05-17, 22:07:13] ~ Anukul Kumar: will be similar in cost and will depend on provider you use for llama3. In general around 0.5-.7 dollar per million For llama3. this is similar to gpt3 which charges 0.5 dollar per million for input. You can check anyscale etc to compare with openai pricing page.

When there's more of them: behaviors can emerge e.g. cooperation, Delegation, competition

That's multi agent systems
[2024-05-18, 09:44:31] Nirant K: Common example of this is when you let a LLM call an API or function on your behalf. That API is a "tool" which the LLM can use, much like a screwdriver is a tool to you.

[2024-05-18, 14:37:52] ~ Ashwin: GPT4o is a lot more confident at making assumptions (probably due it's pursuit of making good conversation). 

For the financial docs we work on, it tends to assume relationships between say fact A and fact B just because they're in the same paragraph. This is consistent even from there is no evidence in the complete context of A being related to B.

Llama 70B is a lot more coherent in this regard.

[2024-05-18, 15:48:43] ~ Mohammed: Have experienced the same. It’s awful
[2024-05-18, 16:04:21] Shashwat TDC: We just got A100 allotted on Google. Feels good.😀 Been stuck here for a month. We been using CPUs at overall slower finetuning cost. In order of ~7 hours / instance

Now comes the hard part. Fine-tuning. The actual act of Fine-tuning on smaller datasets (yet big in size, in case of image models) with multiple biz logic.  

I feel as GPUs get more democratise (access at cheap $) more AI projects will get prioritised and a lot of new jobs for PMs/ Data Engineers/ Data scientists are going to get opened up... 

In longer scheme of things, 2022-2025 may be referred as the great AI transition period. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-05-18, 17:28:44] ~ dhruv: folks, what is the best way to quickly index multiple large documents and store them? By large we are looking at 4-5GBs of pdfs, word docs etc. 

we store different user documents in our s3 bucket read them via the listobjectv2 method and pass them to create embeddings and store them. 

Any better, faster method here that we maybe missing? also any preferred choice of vectordb for storage? Thanks!
[2024-05-18, 17:31:22] Dhruv Anand: LlamaIndex with S3 and qdrant connectors may be good, if you don't need to do too much customization ‎<This message was edited>

Moreover, the training a transformers with KANs is just too slow and as the community says, the results a also not that substantially different, i.e. delta is not much. 

have a look at these repos, I'm still researching considering KANs are just a few weeks old.

This focussed discussion will be good for the community I believe
[2024-05-19, 11:01:58] Rajesh Parikh Cynepia: Additionally where are folks getting stuck despite frameworks. From what I can see prompt is still your logic file. Frameworks don't address the harder part
[2024-05-19, 11:02:15] Rajesh Parikh Cynepia: Beyond modularity
[2024-05-19, 11:05:11] Shan: One problem we face practically is that the gap between “it works for this use case” and “it works” is not just wide it’s also hard to quantify and improve upon. If your agent flow fails you need to debug it and figure out what went wrong. But how do you improve it reliably? In some cases it will feel like eggshells upon eggshells. 

Having said that we think frameworks are incredibly useful to reduce manual effort of threading things together in code.

any inputs/suggestion ?

[2024-05-19, 14:17:58] ~ Sachin Kalsi: yes. gonna try this, but we have very less training points. I'll create more training data & try this

400M - we have for inference
[2024-05-19, 14:18:21] Abhishek Mishra: these T5 and BART models are trained heavily on Wikipedia and know the format very well
[2024-05-19, 14:19:05] Abhishek Mishra: Converting from one format to another is an easier problem than expecting these models to adhere to a new format. So try if you see consistency in them responding in Wikipedia format before fine tuning?
[2024-05-19, 14:19:21] Abhishek Mishra: Fine tuning with 400M data points that are well formatted can work as well.
[2024-05-19, 14:19:45] Priyesh OnFinance: 400M data points is a lot
[2024-05-19, 14:19:48] Priyesh OnFinance: for decoder-only

[2024-05-19, 14:26:10] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: For 6M it was around 25k for us and I'm very cheap and did so much to reduce the cost

[2024-05-19, 15:56:37] Cheril Chicago Human+AI: yup and interesting thing about lms, is that even early lms were surprisingly good at putting genetically similar languages closer geometrically, so moe is making pattern learning easier ig
[2024-05-19, 15:56:43] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Yes, a high-level read-in gave me mixed feelings about the continuity of the write-up. Looks like language alignment before and after Learning is something new.
[2024-05-19, 15:57:43] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: That's two times too many
[2024-05-19, 15:57:52] Cheril Chicago Human+AI: my assumption is that moe is boosted by the whole language family association thing in multilingual models, but cannot say for sure without verifying in practice

[2024-05-19, 16:01:20] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I'm trying to think if this approach can be useful for domain specific models, too 🤔
[2024-05-19, 16:01:52] Priyesh OnFinance: tried. failed spectacularly

[2024-05-19, 16:03:29] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Awesome. Saved me some time and compute. 😂
I was thinking about multilingual semantics with domain nuances.
[2024-05-19, 16:03:29] Cheril Chicago Human+AI: i think moe is working for multilingual lms just bcz of the lang family association thing, similarly if the domain specific model has some task/domain similariteis (eg opthalmology and radiology say) could work but not sure about unrelated domains
[2024-05-19, 16:03:57] Priyesh OnFinance: not saying wont work. finance domains dont have language differences for experts to notice is all
[2024-05-19, 16:04:40] Priyesh OnFinance: easier to use multiple PEFTs + GPT router is all I am saying 🙉

[2024-05-19, 18:09:30] ~ Anjineyulu: Taking inspiration from SUTRA's decoupling approach, you could design a fintech LLM architecture that separates:

A core "financial concepts" model that learns and encodes the universal economic/financial principles in a representation-agnostic latent space. This would be analogous to SUTRA's concept model.
Multiple specialized encoders and decoders that handle the regional, asset-class, and instrument-specific nuances in how these concepts are represented, quantified and applied in practice.

[2024-05-20, 12:41:06] Kshitij Agrawal ML Engineer: Hey Folks, 
What's the best practice to extract reasoning based on a dataframe using gpt ? 
I have a pro/con list of 20 rows (features) and 3-4 columns (refers to different products). I have already ranked the best products, I just want the LLM to come up with the reasoning that justifies the ranking based on the product features.
[2024-05-20, 13:06:17] Ravi Theja: usually the features are columns whenever we do analysis and LLM training might also have happened in similar manner, probably keep the features as columns here might see better results.
[2024-05-20, 13:06:24] Chaitanya A GenAI: im looking for azure openai / openai credits, i recall someone mentioning here that theyve stopped giving those out via msft for startups - what’re some other channels to seek credits?
[2024-05-20, 13:07:40] Kshitij Agrawal ML Engineer: Thanks Ravi, this makes sense. Will test this out.
[2024-05-20, 15:01:53] Sumba: Hi
Bit of an additional question to the thread of GPT4 vs GPT4o
I am using these LLMs in a Agent workflow (plan and solve workflow with some tools)
I am noticing that althought GPT4o is producing better plans and steps, gpt4o is not strictly following the format that i want the output to follow compared to gpt4 which gets it right pretty much 95% of the time

Did anyone else face this issue of format not coming right with GPT4o?
any solutions that ?
------------------
Here is an example of the format i want the LLM to follow in its output:
```Task: Identify the main concerns of employees who do not recommend the company.
Plan: Extract common 'cons' from reviews where the 'Recommend' column is negative.
#E1 = SQLAgent[Select cons from reviews where employees do not recommend the company]
Plan: Summarize the most frequent complaints from the extracted data.
#E2 = LLM[Summarize the common complaints from #E1]
```

Here is an example of it failing:
```
Question: Develop a profile of an employee likely to recommend the company based on various attributes.
#### Plan: Identify the attributes of employees who recommend the company.
1. **Step 1:** Extract data for employees who recommend the company, focusing on various attributes such as job title, rating, pros, cons, and other relevant columns.
   - **Tool:** SQLAgent
   - **Input:** Select job, rating, pros, cons, 'Career Opportunities', 'Compensation and Benefits', 'Senior Management', 'Work/Life Balance', 'Culture & Values', 'Diversity & Inclusion' from reviews where 'Recommend' is positive.
   - **Output Variable:** #E1

#E1 = SQLAgent[Select job, rating, pros, cons, 'Career Opportunities', 'Compensation and Benefits', 'Senior Management', 'Work/Life Balance', 'Culture & Values', 'Diversity & Inclusion' from reviews where 'Recommend' is positive]
```
[2024-05-20, 15:02:51] Sumba: using langchain and langgraph for this POC for now if it helps

[2024-05-20, 15:44:49] Shan: What advise are you guys giving budding data scientists who are just graduating. What should they be reading or starting with
[2024-05-20, 16:21:17] ~ Yash: Data science is science first, so understanding the basics of ML, how to experiment, evaluation protocol, and robustness assessment comes first. 

Then the other thing I recommend is try fast, fail fast. 

First question if ML is needed, then test for feasibility, then experiment at scale, then pilot, then prod.

Finally, understand that ML isn’t a golden bullet. Any practical implementation will need guardrails, fallbacks and needs a plan on incremental improvements and a roadmap.
[2024-05-20, 16:30:22] ~ Swapnil: cant summarise better. I just want to further add to it by saying that dont try to force fit ML where things can be solved with simple algos or rules.  There are many ways to solve a problem. start with problem and then think of solutions rather than starting with solutions and then trying to find problems for it.
[2024-05-20, 16:30:30] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: I second what Yash said above about the ML basics. Some things I'd say:
1. Learn SQL well. Work with relational DBs and at least one NoSQL database
2. Understand how real world systems get built - building a model or hitting LLM APIs are not the end-all. Speak to a few potential users and build your own app, it may give you insight
3. Build your own dataset and try to get it published / hosted somewhere. Find a problem space and understand the dataset needs, and try to build your dataset
4. Try and build one of the transformer models from scratch - NanoGPT by Karpathy is a good starting point which breaks things down well step by step.
5. Understand ML model metrics and evaluation and performance. Different ones for different situations
6. Think end-to-end, and understand/ask questions about how a product is shipped. Understand how deployment pipelines, infra, and other deployment considerations may affect your app and how you arrive at those things 
There's obviously a lot of other material out there. I hope this helps.
[2024-05-20, 16:34:26] ~ Anuj Mehta: Hey All, I have recently joined this group  and am amazed by quality of discussions here. I am looking for guidance in GenAI. In past 6 months I have developed co-pilot that internally uses RAG (for symantic search on docs), interaction with structured data (Natural Lang --> SQL) and interaction with API's (NLP --> Swagger API). I feel I have barely scratched the surface of GenAI and lack understanding of even basics of Neural Networks. To gain better understanding of this area should I take some Deep Learning courses or read books? Some guidance in this regard will be helpful.

[2024-05-20, 20:16:23] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Building deep nets using one of the pre-eminent frameworks - keras, tensorflow, pytorch - is a good start, if you already know some ML and can write simple models in frameworks such as sklearn. Lots of good material out there, and it depends on what you want to learn and your starting point. If you want to discuss you can message me.

[2024-05-21, 10:40:09] Mihir Kulkarni WadhwaniAI, Princeton: I think Altman tried to pull a fast one and got found out, and is scrambling now. The relevant details are that OpenAI reached out to recruit her, lied about doing so, created a demo that could be mistaken for her and had their CEO tweet “her” — this is damning. They took it down when her lawyers wrote to them, which to me is also an implicit if partial acknowledgment of the fact that they are in the wrong. 

The way they went about this is a pretty bad look, not to mention kind of stupid. ScarJo doesn’t take prisoners (ref. her Black Widow lawsuit with Disney) and the rip-off is blatant.

OpenAI’s responsible AI rhetoric is increasingly seeming hollow these days— whether you care about labour rights and IP or AGI stuff.
[2024-05-21, 10:43:35] Rajiv Poddar DevGPT: that motto has gotten valley to where is is right now. it's their edge. they're not gonna ditch it now.

[2024-05-21, 20:37:07] Jacob Singh: Am curious about tagging services in India.  I’m talking to a company who is spending quite a bit of money on tagging of voice samples and imagery from some kinda random services shops. Does anyone here have substantial budgets (>$10k/mo) going towards manual tagging of samples? Would like to learn more
[2024-05-21, 20:44:35] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: Can this not be automated with batch APIs of openai with gpt-4o or 4 Turbo model? 

Attach a voice file and ask it to tag it for tone, language, accent etc
[2024-05-21, 20:46:03] Jacob Singh: I’m guessing you will get a lot from that, yes… but perhaps there are other insights to be gleaned from human tagging?  I don’t know, that’s why I’m asking 🤷‍♂️
[2024-05-21, 20:47:52] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: Humans can make a lot of error or take a lot of time. I think the service shops must be charging more because of that. However, one does a first pass with AI and uses humans only for verification and adding missing data, it *might* cost lesser
[2024-05-21, 20:49:17] Nirant K: Humans are terrible data annotators. Inconsistent over time, need very specific instructions, lot of training for anything beyond images

[2024-05-21, 21:01:21] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: What everyone said.. have worked with data labelling teams both for image and text. It was only useful for cases where AI tools did poorly, for example phone conversations in local Indian languages. With the variety of accents, dialects and quality of audio present all ASR tools gave garbage results.
[2024-05-21, 21:06:03] Jacob Singh: THank you, that’s super helpful.  Do you have any sense of the prevailing rate for labeling services on a per sample basis?
[2024-05-21, 21:09:08] ~ Nishanth Chandrasekar: No idea, sorry. Just that like others have pointed out, you’ll have to do stuff like get multiple people to label the same piece of data to reduce errors, very often you’ll realise different labellers are labelling things differently in subtle ways, which means multiple restarts. So I’d double any estimate you have just to be safe.

[2024-05-21, 23:55:15] ~ Navdeesh Ahuja: About human labelling
1) Pick a startup/org where your major audience is. Example, dont give labeling work to philippines or any other country, if targeting India as a consumer. People going global may adopt labeling agencies in multi countries.
2) Ask specific question.
3) Make sure the labeling company has its own tech platform. They shouldnt be using excel.
4) Dont use excel/csv after poc is done. Integrate APIs
5) Only onboard agencies who do QC in house before giving labeling data back to you.
6) Good agencies should charge according to man hours / man minutes. Avg rate in India is $2/man-minute

Very fascinating thoughts. Shows that LLMs have a lot to improve.

 Explainability research like this is going to perhaps improve or provide better ways of building proper models

Great article.
[2024-05-22, 07:31:37] Shruthi Badri: Does anyone have experience running/self hosting small models (8/13B) with a massive amount of throughput? Like 1000 inferences a minute? Most of the api asservices rate limit at 1000/hr
[2024-05-22, 07:35:02] ~ Hadi Khan: I have used Mistral small. Mistral API have whopping rate limits - 2M/hr
[2024-05-22, 07:38:55] ~ Hadi Khan: my bad that's 2M tokens. API requests are 1000/minute

[2024-05-22, 08:13:56] Shan: Technologies end up finding their niche. Linux and Windows/Mac are coexisting happily. HTML/pdf also coexist happily. There will be cases where large models serve a purpose and there will be cases where open source ones will. Reality is seldom white and black, there tends to be tons of gray.
‎[2024-05-22, 08:17:20] Anubhav mishra Zupay: ‎image omitted
[2024-05-22, 08:25:01] Shan: Au contraire, phi, which is an open source model, will soon be shipping bundled with windows. Mac will follow soon. Which means perhaps a billion people will soon be using an open source model on their laptop daily. This isn’t far fetched IMO.  And just like there are still browser companies around which provide a better browser despite there being a browser shipped in-built with every OS, you can imagine third party model providers (including open source ones, just like Firefox browser to continue the previous analogy). 

In fact I’m more convinced of this than otherwise.

[2024-05-22, 15:35:18] ~ Akshay Taneja: And then vLLM workflow in runpod can be used to quickly create a serverless endpoint for it
[2024-05-22, 15:36:01] ~ Akshay Taneja: The best thing about runpod is ability to scale the workers to 0

[2024-05-22, 15:36:43] ~ Akshay Taneja: And unlike replicate which has long boot times, boot time is very quick in runpod. 2-3 seconds
[2024-05-22, 15:42:16] ~ Akshay Taneja: You can also explore other products like E2E cloud and Monster Api
[2024-05-22, 15:42:25] Anand S Gramener: @918929090206 -- the pricing page https://www.together.ai/pricing is clear. $0.20/MTok for an 8b model, fine-tuned or  otherwise.

From the Runpod serverless pricing https://www.runpod.io/serverless-gpu I gather that it's per second and based on GPU usage.

Together.ai seems a lot closer to what I had in mind -- thanks!
[2024-05-22, 15:42:26] ~ Akshay Taneja: They are nearly as good as together ai

[2024-05-22, 15:45:42] Anand S Gramener: Ah, I missed that part. You're right. Together.ai is one a per-hour basis as well for fine-tuned models. And I think we'd start and stop the servers as required.

Given that, I guess Runpod serverless is the more cost-effective one, since we're not paying for idle cost, nor managing that. Is that right?
[2024-05-22, 15:46:01] ~ Akshay Taneja: Yes, plus their vLLM endpoint

Cold start is the problem, and I can send a 10 token API call every hour to not let the instance die. I don't know how they are going to make money. It is not sustainable to run a model hot on GPU and then charge just based on Token. I can have 24H GPU access for $0.1

[2024-05-23, 07:29:25] Nirant K: Direct link in the spirit of being a good citizen. 

Mostly common advice of using synthetic queries e.g. RAGAS had this in Nov 2023, Portkey wrote about this too at the time if I remember correctly, but I might be wrong 

Vespa, Qdrant and Pinecone have recommended using hybrid search i.e. dense+sparse since 2022 or so at different points in time. 

Keyword filtering / full text search (BM25 Okapi?) is way more useful for retrieval and scaling than ranking in my limited experience though.

[2024-05-23, 07:43:44] Nirant K: As @917977314565 would tell, there's no such thing as BM25 - there's just so many flavours. 

Also, sparse vectors are the generalisation of BM25 - and better for RAG because of more Fine-tuning potential
[2024-05-23, 09:16:31] Paras Chopra Wingify: This is emergent no? By wmergent I meant the substrate on which such symbolic logic is run is nothing like a CPU
[2024-05-23, 09:32:55] Nirant K: I don't think compute and memory are as isolated as they are in present day designs. CPU and GPU design, including Von Neumann could be a local maxima anyway. Missile, satellite, GIS and several medical systems work around those for instance with interrupt driven OS.

[2024-05-23, 11:23:39] Dhruv Anand: I mean weaviate definitely has _a_ flavor of BM25 implemented since a long time. _Any_ BM25 is better than no BM25.

Having it available out-of-the-box is a big plus for non-IR people, compared to just allowing bringing arbitrary sparse vectors.
[2024-05-23, 11:26:29] Dhruv Anand: I guess the challenge is to get it to work for arbitrary layouts. Check the output that Azure Document Intelligence gives. It should be possible to run a function calling LLM on top of that output to get the image (placeholder), caption and detailed description in a structured format.
[2024-05-23, 12:51:35] Vamshi: Even if you decouple from machine architecture, there’s still the gap that compositionality doesn’t emerge with current models.

Symbolic systems have the lambda calculus which is decoupled from an actual machine architecture, but captures the essence of meta circularity and recursive decomposition.

Compositionality is often spoken about in the context of interpretability, but I think it’s more than that, perhaps … ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-23, 12:56:24] Vamshi: Just an opinion of course, in case it sounds presumptuous 😅

[2024-05-23, 13:28:00] Aaryaman Vir VC: Guys a question about determinism and non-determinism in LLM chip architectures:

As I understand it, deterministic SRAM-based systems can interpret a program and chart out all the steps that program will take to execute. It can then allocate resources to completing that program sequentially. 

In contrast, non deterministic processes that rely on parallelism assign computations to different resources and processes which don’t have guarantees on when they will terminate or where to retrieve information from. Consequently the overall program execution needs to lock certain memory resources and wait for the parallel processes to terminate before moving ahead. This results in slower speed of execution

is that broadly correct?

[2024-05-23, 13:48:27] Vamshi: Learning recursive state. 

Related to what @918660898149 was saying about adding an inductive bias - maybe via external memory.

There was also the result of practical limitations related to soft vs hard attention and arbitrary internal precision.

Emergence of anything is possible theoretically (hard attention being Turing complete), but will it be usable or tractable…

Usability makes the case for it being primarily about interpretability, but tractability makes a case for limits on such features to emerge even at the current model scale ?

It argues that Instructions < Expressions < Propagators. But even there, separating state and computation gets rid of all the synchronization issues.

[2024-05-23, 17:49:36] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: By JSON mode, you mean prompting it to produce a JSON? I can barely get this right for longer prompts. Short prompts with clear instructions work well. Longer prompts for GPT 4 almost always result in more conversational fluff instead of a pure JSON
[2024-05-23, 17:50:06] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: If there is a better way to do this so it generates JSONs that can be validated by a schema validator, I'd be happy to know.
[2024-05-23, 17:51:47] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: tSNE used to be super helpful when visualizing higher dimensional data but you'd get such varying results (by nature of the algorithm? or starting parameters?). In any case it worked great for a couple of use cases with sensor data.

[2024-05-23, 20:07:54] ~ Shubham: Hi everyone,

Question: I want to fine-tune to get a text-to-code model.
The model should take text that describes a flowchart e.g generate a flowchart to visualise the MLOps process and output the following:
{
  "nodes": [
    {"id": "1", "type": "input", "data": {"label": "Data Ingestion"}, "position": {"x": 250, "y": 5}},
    {"id": "2", "data": {"label": "Data Processing"}, "position": {"x": 250, "y": 100}},
    {"id": "3", "data": {"label": "Model Training"}, "position": {"x": 250, "y": 200}},
    {"id": "4", "data": {"label": "Model Evaluation"}, "position": {"x": 250, "y": 300}},
    {"id": "5", "data": {"label": "Model Deployment"}, "position": {"x": 250, "y": 400}},
    {"id": "6", "type": "output", "data": {"label": "Monitoring & Maintenance"}, "position": {"x": 250, "y": 500}}
  ],
  "edges": [
    {"id": "e1-2", "source": "1", "target": "2", "type": "smoothstep"},
    {"id": "e2-3", "source": "2", "target": "3", "type": "smoothstep"},
    {"id": "e3-4", "source": "3", "target": "4", "type": "smoothstep"},
    {"id": "e4-5", "source": "4", "target": "5", "type": "smoothstep"},
    {"id": "e5-6", "source": "5", "target": "6", "type": "smoothstep"}
  ]
}

This can then be visualised using https://reactflow.dev/.

Base LLM choice: I am considering using CodeGemma:2B for this. Why? Because it is code-specific, small and can be fine-tuned on a single A100 GPU 40GB. As claimed https://github.com/NVIDIA/GenerativeAIExamples/blob/main/models/Codegemma/lora.ipynb.

How should I go about creating a good dataset for this problem? How many samples would I need?
[2024-05-23, 20:16:06] Srimouli GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: How many samples would you need is an open ended question as there no one size fits all, but if you are finetuning the model as it's a smaller one try will may be start with  500-1000 examples and see the performance and then gradually increase the number of examples

But if you are ideally training the model from scratch as per chinchilla laws paper it is recommended that you  have roughly four to five times number of model params 

But as you are fine tuning ideally having about 10% of the model parameters can give you good results
[2024-05-23, 20:16:59] Srimouli GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: But this is again speculative and needs to be decided only after experimentation you may get better results even with fewer data tokens as well

For a simpler case like intent classification I tried using almost  0.5M tokens and the finetuning results were ok, but it wasn't great but when using the same dataset on a larger parameter model results were better. Here the challenge is how well you can prepare the quality data ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-05-24, 01:22:03] ~ Rohan: I am working on a project in which I am trying to detect fallacies used by political parties on various occasion like debate shows and rallies. I am very confused how to make llm to do so. I have a very clear descriptive explanation of each fallacy (in very very detail) but very few examples, as much of my knowledge RAG will not work here nor finetune as examples are very few. is there any way I can grant llm with knowledge of fallacy detection using finetuning or rag or any other pipeline.
[2024-05-24, 01:22:22] ~ Rohan: in case u don't know what is fallacy https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Qt4f7QrfRRc&list=PLo6awPrrk01TwOiPillMgqgxBmZoaGY1Y&index=2
[2024-05-24, 01:30:44] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Most of the LLMs know fallacies, it is a different question if they can identify one. It doesn't make sense to use RAG, just ask an LLM to identify a fallacy from a given list, if it exists.
[2024-05-24, 01:36:28] ~ Rohan: so they are pretrained but I want to improve their performance based upon the very descriptive explanation which I have?
[2024-05-24, 09:51:28] ~ Rohan: Any method 😢
[2024-05-24, 09:53:46] Srimouli GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: with the kind of dataset you are having as you described earlier In context learning is the best approach or may be you can work something out with COT, because training/finetuning an LLM without ample data wouldn’t lead to better results
[2024-05-24, 09:54:42] Shan: Broadly, what are the tools folks are using to manage training data at scale. How do you ensure data is high quality and is not degrading as you add more? Or at least, is not gibberish. Any pointers to tools or blog posts.
[2024-05-24, 09:54:52] ~ Hadi Khan: How few exactly?
[2024-05-24, 09:55:54] ~ Hadi Khan: Exactly my thought

[2024-05-24, 12:31:44] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: As I see all this I'm more and more confident that generative models need knowledge agents for multi modal information.

If Google had an image database of mushrooms that it could contextually access before generating a response, there's no way that this happens.

Which is the best open source text to video model right now?
[2024-05-24, 15:19:34] ~ Adhitya Swaminathan: The Open Source scene for video models is quite limited, mostly because training such models requires a huge amount of compute and this is not easily available OS.

Maybe check out Open-Sora, it was decent last I saw. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-24, 15:20:06] ~ Aryan Madhav Verma: Has anyone tried function calling with snowflake’s new arctic model? It natively doesn’t support it but I wonder what results people are getting with basic prompting for tool invocation?
[2024-05-24, 15:20:08] ~ Ramesh: Hi, Exploring Voice Based Shopping cart application with Indic language support. Exploring Azure SpeechtoText, Whisper and IndicConformer (AI4Bharat) for the same and planning to pass to GPT4o for converting it to JSON for populating Shopping Cart (based on predefined product list). The use case is to take lot of orders in B2B scenario and so want to try out streaming mode for cart to be populated progressively. Any pointers or reference implementation for this?
[2024-05-24, 15:46:40] ~ Nihal Kashinath: Is anyone aware of a tool that can take a "person" from www.thispersondoesnotexist.com and bring them to life?

[2024-05-24, 18:06:50] Purby GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: Haven’t used Martian LLM routers but have tried the LLM selector by llamaindex.. I wanted to define my own models and meta data.
[2024-05-24, 18:14:39] Lavish 2017: I have used Martian at 10K calls per day scale and also built a router myself between 4 models with a NN trained on eval sets and preferred models


if you don’t have very high scale where cost is becoming a problem, I won’t recommend using. predictability is much better. however do try for yourself as my experience is 4-5 months old
[2024-05-24, 18:16:49] Lavish 2017: only used for a few days. they started building custom router afterwards for companies. I got early access to generic router which didn’t work very well.

so you can ask them to build a custom router for you if cost is high as well or diy

1. Simple Speech to text, pass it to llm , get response , again text to speech.
2. ⁠Is there a way where I can directly stream audio response from the llm and use it in my app?
[2024-05-25, 08:47:56] ~ Palash: 1. Yes
2. Afaik would be possible with GPT 4o APIs when they are updated and not today
[2024-05-25, 08:49:14] ~ Nitin Kalra: https://tldv.io/

Something similar to this?
[2024-05-25, 08:51:05] ~ Soham: I don’t walk it to take notes actually. It should listen to the entire conversation and give inputs in the meeting (based on the subject of the meeting) when prompted
[2024-05-25, 08:53:06] Rajesh RS Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Interesting use case. Perhaps the approach (1) described above may work better if you want to infuse custom logic.

--
Context : 
I am building a lot code copilot (code generation, debugging, design to code, etc) features in my company using RAG. It is for developers bulding on our SaaS marketplace. 

How do I measure effectiveness of these features. Right now we use benchmark datasets ( pre-defined prompts, responses, etc) to measure. 

Any other ways folks are using here for success metrics of AI features?
[2024-05-25, 10:11:36] Nirant K: Simplest is time to what the feature is supposed to do e.g. if this is supposed to help folks ship faster, perhaps measure session duration and if that's decreasing. Or number of keystrokes if the intent is to reduce dev fatigue and so on.
[2024-05-25, 10:12:31] Neeraj Kumar: Thanks. Indeed goal is to improve developer productivity and time to build.
[2024-05-25, 10:18:19] Shan: Launch and get a 👍 👎 from users. That’s your first cut measure. Implicit measures are even better (does the user modify your output, accept it as is) etc. 

Over time the data set should be anonymised end to end user interactions
[2024-05-25, 10:19:06] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: Also implement feedback and maybe a regenerate button. Ask for feedback and/or also check how many times regenerate is being used.
[2024-05-25, 10:20:23] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: Chat interfaces work better for code generation, IMO. That way one gets to tweak the code. Chat session length is a good example to measure if the code generated is effective and useful

[2024-05-25, 10:25:48] ~ Sushant: Yes.
Significantly more reliable than normal on demand endpoints. 

502s drastically reduced when shifted to PTU.

But, metrics was.
It's 2-2.5x more perfomonant (depending upon the model) for 4x the price.

[2024-05-25, 11:07:25] ~ Prateek Sachan: hi, approximately we're seeing 700-800ms of E2E using deepgram/whisper + openai/llama-3 + deepgram/polly/11-labs. it does fluctuate a lot hence we’re in the process of putting up a benchmarking report having latency metrics by next week.
[2024-05-25, 11:08:37] ~ Prateek Sachan: hello, using VAD whenever we get a signal, we stop transmitting for a pre-defined period and if we get an interim transcript which usually takes 300-400ms with Deepgram and 400-600ms with whisper small.
We send a clear message to the telephony provider and we clear the buffered output queue.

[2024-05-25, 11:25:33] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: 800 ms, that’s not even openai call latency ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-25, 11:27:01] ~ Mayank: Can add that we are facing a similar approximate e2e latency using assembly ai + llama 3 + eleven labs
[2024-05-25, 11:30:46] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: First token LLM latency is 300ms minimum, with fastest being Groq.
[2024-05-25, 11:31:06] Nithin Vasishta IIT B MILA: Super interesting
[2024-05-25, 11:31:55] ~ Prateek Sachan: we use streaming. 1st connection takes time for all providers which we sort of pre-open and do the connections as part of warmup.

from then on - we only stream packets
[2024-05-25, 11:32:32] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: You still have to make LLM call once the entire text has been captured
[2024-05-25, 11:32:44] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: I get the streaming part
[2024-05-25, 11:33:50] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: So I’m assuming E2E will be calculated between end of the user speech and start of first tts token.
[2024-05-25, 11:36:22] ~ Prateek Sachan: not the entire text. so asr is also streaming..as and when we get the stream output data from asr we keep pushing it to LLM. we also make use of interim transcript and try to “predict” the asr output to improve the latency b/w asr <> llm
[2024-05-25, 11:44:01] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Pushing streaming asr to llm, I have found it like walking on the edge of the sword, as you can't place guardrails or do rag. However, 600-800ms latency is impressive. Will have to check Deepgram for latency.

Now we are working on fixing a lot of the latencies by bringing as many things as possible local and also some platform optimizations. We should have an experimental support by next week if anyone is interested.
[2024-05-25, 11:59:27] ~ Prateek Sachan: we do guardrails yes. what we do there is we calculate embedding and cosine similarity b/w output and the embeddings using fastembed(https://github.com/bolna-ai/bolna/blob/master/bolna/memory/cache/vector_cache.py#L6. h/t @917737887058) which helps us do that in < 100ms. for RAG, we are currently working on it. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-05-25, 16:15:49] ~ Pathik Ghugare: When do you guys draw line on deciding whether to use LLM in a specific or go with traditional approach while approaching a problem for first time?

Cuz I've seen two types people 
one who just immediately say that with prompting you can solve this so no need to put any extra efforts on training other models and writing heuristics or logics but depending upon the usecases, some of them later realised it's not worth it, mainly due to costing and latency and they end up pivoting to traditional approaches

Then there's also a class of people who first add efforts to start with traditional approaches and if they see it solves the problem then let's see how some LLM can solve this problem and later on evaluate which works best

So in general which approach is the best one? ‎<This message was edited>

The more you allow your LLM to access external information and base the response on that information, the more likely it will regurgitate answers based on false or troll information on the edge cases. To counter this, I feel there needs to be another layer between raw uncensored internet information used for RAG and the LLM. This layer verifies and validates the information for RAG usage. ‎<This message was edited>

[2024-05-26, 21:49:29] ~ Varun Jain: https://github.com/princeton-nlp/SWE-agent

This is what I'm referring to
[2024-05-26, 22:18:26] Harsh Gupta Felvin: I tried it, was super slow, very expensive and didn’t solve a relatively simple issue
[2024-05-26, 22:19:10] Harsh Gupta Felvin: Very expensive as in ate up $3 worth of GPT-4 tokens without doing anything good
[2024-05-26, 22:55:23] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Software agents are a big disappointment, and I don't think any new technique will make them any better besides the LLM itself getting better and lifting performance.
[2024-05-26, 22:56:44] ~ Varun Jain: Why do you think so? A lot of the coding that you do tends to be a loop of: prompt, llm outputs code, try code, check output, go back to llm. You would expect this should be possible to automate
[2024-05-26, 22:57:40] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: LLM needs to be really good at reasoning.
[2024-05-26, 22:57:46] ~ Varun Jain: Also, I've seen that sometimes GPT-4 works well and some other times Opus works well. Whereas individually sometimes they get stuck in a loop of the same suggestions. Agents could possibly use both if it detects it is stuck in a loop
[2024-05-26, 22:58:25] ~ Varun Jain: So yeah, theoretically, I feel that they could work well. But that's what I wanted to check - has someone had practical success with using them
[2024-05-26, 22:58:41] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: GPT5 can probably make it a little better. However, LLM still can't do any high-level coding.
[2024-05-26, 22:58:59] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: For any practical thing right now, none of the agents are good.
[2024-05-26, 22:59:52] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: Some form of context vectors that do well for specific task to make llm (the one that is trained on lot of coding examples) better can be one direction (without prompt engineering that is)?
[2024-05-26, 23:00:25] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: https://vgel.me/posts/representation-engineering/#So_what_exactly_is_a_control_vector?
[2024-05-26, 23:01:57] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: I checked this in searching and googling around - https://www.phronetic.ai/blogs/the-power-of-control-vectors-in-ai .. wonder if someone had some good success in exploratory reasoning of llms using this
[2024-05-26, 23:03:56] ~ Akshay Taneja: Yes we have used this for a personality chat product where user can talk to any fictional character which mimics it's personality, similar to character ai
[2024-05-26, 23:04:55] ~ Akshay Taneja: I don't think it can improve the reasoning of llms. But responses from different agents each with different skillsets can be combined to get an overall better quality reasoning
[2024-05-26, 23:05:14] ~ Akshay Taneja: Alone or via a single response from llm, it may not improve reasoning much
[2024-05-26, 23:05:38] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: yeah, this makes sense.
[2024-05-26, 23:06:37] ~ Pritish: Autonomous software agents - yes 
Software agents assisting humans - big success 
I have heard and even have first hand experience of coding a prototype of complete SaaS applications (frontend, backend) in around 4-5 hours even without any coding experience

[2024-05-26, 23:07:53] ~ Sharad Chitlangia: There is also a leaderboard for the benchmark used: https://www.swebench.com/
[2024-05-26, 23:08:23] ~ Varun Jain: which sort of 'software agents assisting humans' frameworks have you heard of in practical use (besides Devin)
[2024-05-26, 23:10:19] Saurav Akaike: byob.akaike.ai does this. You might want to check that out too.
[2024-05-26, 23:10:31] ~ Pritish: I would slightly disagree here
Copilot would be like LLM assisting a Google coder - which by the way is already automating 30-40% work - heard from multiple Google/AWS coders now 

Here I’m talking about code itself being written by AI. Humans are prompting logic and debugging
[2024-05-26, 23:12:22] ~ Shyam: https://arxiv.org/pdf/2308.08155

I think multi agent collaboration  and cooperation will result in better reasoning over time.

This talk by andrew Ng also shed some light in that direction : https://youtu.be/sal78ACtGTc?si=jaBtE5Q0jvXjGMzu
[2024-05-26, 23:17:51] Soham (Composio.dev): Our experience with SWE was really bad due to low accuracy, high cost & latency. 

We are internally building toolset for SWEish agents that can allow us to power them via any agentic frameworks like autogen, crewai. 

My hunch is you don't really need better model reasoning but just improving agentic collaboration pattern, along with design of tools should drastically improve them.
[2024-05-26, 23:19:16] ~ Sparsh Jain: I have built a rag service on my documents using langchain, faiss, with openai embeddings. 

However when I am doing the similarity search (retrieval), it is bringing the full document in results instead of a chunk of document. ( I have set the chunk size to be 1000, yet I am getting the full document )

Can anyone tell what might be the issue here ? ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-26, 23:21:50] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: This is very vague question. What are you using for RAG? your own code, langchain, llama index? What vdb are you using?

Once we cut away the hype, what we’re usually left with are plain engineering and machine learning problems."

[2024-05-27, 08:31:48] Srimouli GenerativeAI WhatsApp Group: Agreed tech is pretty much the same at the root level, In my opinion the hype is all about, and the scale at which the operations are being made in the LLMs and how its being branded
[2024-05-27, 09:07:34] Nirant K: Yeah, if you're as good as Vicky (author) across ML Training, Inference, dataset curation, engineering design patterns, evaluations, distributed systems you've no reason to worry about LLMs
[2024-05-27, 09:45:56] Shashwat TDC: If not scaling, then specialised dataset. 

"In Orca 2, we teach the model various reasoning techniques (step-by-step, recall then generate, recall-reason-generate, direct answer, etc.). More crucially, we aim to help the model learn to determine the most effective solution strategy for each task."
[2024-05-27, 09:57:47] ~ Varun Jain: Great read, thanks
[2024-05-27, 10:17:41] Shikhil Kumar Gupta: What do you mean by a specialised dataset?

Also, without improving the reasoning of the model, how we can incorporate various reasoning techniques. 

I believe model reasoning ability can be increased by more size.

[2024-05-28, 06:59:59] Nitesh Methani: One more question, I am not able to wrap my head around agentic workflow. Here is my understanding, can someone pls confirm?

Given a user prompt, LLM outputs either a text (which we can show directly to the user) or a API endpoint (which we somehow make a call to).

Questions:
1.How does LLM know the syntax of the API endpoint? Eg, how does it know whether to return "search(query)" vs "search_google(query)" vs "find(query)"?

2.The output of LLM is always a string so how exactly it gets converted to a function call?

3.The chat interface UI looks interesting as it determines whether to show an image, json, code, text, markdown, etc. I understand there might be some flag in the response but would like to extend it to for other types as well (eg, Polls). Any good quality open source implementation for this?
[2024-05-28, 07:07:31] Nirant K: The first 2 questions are answered in OpenAI Cookbook and docs both. Not to mention Langchain and others who've made videos on tool usage on YouTube as well.
[2024-05-28, 07:19:52] ~ SaiVignanM: Any one worked with paligemma vision transformer.

If so, How are the results?
[2024-05-28, 07:23:13] ~ Yash: When you say production grade open source, I’m confused. If it’s open source, won’t you have to put it into production and implement the system your self? Then production is what you define it to be. Eg. To save costs you might implement your prod system to be batch but you add human in the loop for RAI.

But then that isn’t production grade for a team requiring streaming output with high throughput and concurrency. The key phrase is You implementing it. 

Production grade, typically, for the good ones, are likely never open source. 

If you mean just the models you can use, there’s lot of open source options, but then you have to stitch it all together.

If you mean performant, then it depends on your task. What is your baseline, what is your target, and what are other considerations and affordances. Are you looking for  the embedding model? Or are you seeking a good vector database.

[2024-05-28, 08:06:26] Bharat Shetty GenAI WhatsApp Group: https://docs.confident-ai.com/docs/metrics-contextual-precision something like this or any other techniques ?
[2024-05-28, 08:22:46] Anand S Gramener: I was thinking of the opposite approach, i.e. use a model self-evaluation to check each time if it already knows the answer well, and then move over to RAG. E.g. asking the model to evaluate if it was correct - https://arxiv.org/abs/2207.05221

But evaluating context quality sounds like a good idea too. Thanks - I learnt about contextual precision metrics 🙂

It does an ok job. It makes segments exactly 30s even if the messaging required slightly more or less and doesn’t always pick segments which have a punch. Any suggestions on how can I can improve this solution?
[2024-05-28, 10:25:15] ~ Bharat Ramanathan: You should look at the topic-tiling algorithms. I think there is a BERT embedding version that splits transcripts into semantically similar chunks. You should be able to use newer embeddings to do this better. Then you can pass the segments to GPT to get it to pick/classify highlights. 

Here's a repo I used previously once to do the same for meetings

[2024-05-29, 10:12:41] Chirasmita Mallick: Has anyone worked in capturing video / audio files from zoom using zoom SDK and send it to a server. Are there any best practices that has worked on this use case.
[2024-05-29, 10:24:01] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: what's the usecase? is zoom mandatory in the picture or any other webrtc wrapper sdk would work?
[2024-05-29, 10:24:47] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: assuming this is not regular recording of the zoom call with audio and video streams? it's files being shared by zoom call participants?
[2024-05-29, 11:32:31] Chirasmita Mallick: It's mandatory to capture the actual zoom call recording, not the files shared to a server. This is for a authentication use case
[2024-05-29, 11:32:35] Chirasmita Mallick: So needs zoom SDK itself

[2024-05-29, 12:52:38] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: If you can compare the code generated by your tool and the code finally deployed by the developer, that will help measure efficiency of your tool
[2024-05-29, 13:45:00] ~ ~I: Hello 
I am trying build an application where you upload a pdf form, it extracts out all the fields in the form that needs to be filled
and finally the user can upload a file which will fill up the fields in the form automatically 

Has someone worked on this before or can share some insights on how to do this? 

Any resource/ideas are much appreciated. Open to DM to discuss in details.
[2024-05-29, 13:53:57] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: how about keeping flow like 1. User uploads a pdf 2. PDF is parsed and read 3. A form is shown to user & user inputs in fields 4. user saves form 5. downloads pdf. ?
[2024-05-29, 13:54:15] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: I see lot of potential to human error when uploading the 2nd file with fields.
[2024-05-29, 13:59:51] Shalabh Aspiro: Here's how I will approach it-
* Use langchain document loader to extract pdf content (and use unstructured-io to convert images (if any) in pdf into text)
* use a gpt function call to extract out the fields to be filled in the extracted pdf content in json format
* convert form field names into corresponding questions that you will ask from contents of file 2, to get the answers.
* use document loader again to extract content of second file
* use another function call to get answers to form field questions, from the content of second file

Probably there will be multiple possible answers for each form field. I will give that as multiple suggestions to pick from in the UI for the user (if that's possible). If that's not possible, disambiguating the right answer will highly depend on the expected content format of the second file...
[2024-05-29, 14:01:45] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: Not necessarily, 
Step 3a. Generate Excel form with necessary local validation 
Step 3b. User input in Excel form
Step 3c. User uploads filled Excel form
Step 3d. Sever side validation 
Step 3e. Accept or reject 
Step 3f. If accepted, give provision to generate doc/pdf/Excel and download 

This can be done very easily in Power automate in Power Platform
[2024-05-29, 14:06:26] ~ ~I: Thanks a lot!
1) How would you implement the 2nd point of extracting out the fields that needs to be filled?
2) How to automatically fill the answers in the pdf?
[2024-05-29, 14:09:18] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: If you want to use python, you can go for openpyxl
[2024-05-29, 14:10:35] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: Not to fill pdf, generate pdf from Form and data
[2024-05-29, 14:11:46] ~ ~I: Got it
but the major challenge lies for me in extracting out the fields to be filled 
How would you do that? Prompting (I suspect might not be very efficient) or there are some clever solutions?
[2024-05-29, 14:12:41] ~ ~I: i think this might not work as forms format is not constant so a validation cant be prepared
[2024-05-29, 14:12:54] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: I wouldn't ask users to upload 2nd file. 

I will parse the first file, create a web/Excel based form out of it and ask user to fill that form
[2024-05-29, 14:14:07] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: Now in first file, chances are some fields are already filled. I will show them as they are in the generated web/Excel based form and enable/disable editing it based on the original form in pdf
[2024-05-29, 14:15:47] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: It means some generic validations, not business rule validations
[2024-05-29, 14:17:54] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: Local Excel files are flexible, but O355 is not that much flexible
[2024-05-29, 14:20:12] Shalabh Aspiro: use something like this- extract form fields as arguments of the function call - https://gist.github.com/kylemcdonald/dbac21de2d7855633689f5526225154c
[2024-05-29, 14:20:35] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: Azure AI is great in PDF extraction
[2024-05-29, 14:21:09] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: Especially in pdf table extraction
[2024-05-29, 14:26:12] ~ ~I: no I agree to your point 
my last question was more on the lines of how to extract out the questions/fields
since the pdf format is not fixed
[2024-05-29, 14:31:57] ~ ~I: but the issue with this is i don't know the pdf format beforehand 
for example -
one form can be insurance claim form other can be a membership registration form 
vastly different fields in each form 
so the model needs to infer the fields on its own
[2024-05-29, 14:32:52] Shalabh Aspiro: For that you have to rely on the smartness of the models
[2024-05-29, 14:34:12] Shalabh Aspiro: Try and iterate with gpt4. I have had success extracting the same content from very different content formats (for a different usecase)
[2024-05-29, 14:34:55] ~ ~I: thanks for letting me know
[2024-05-29, 14:45:21] Pratiksha Dake Unacademy: gpt 4o is pretty good at extraction
[2024-05-29, 14:58:20] ~ Nitin Kalra: Hi

has anyone used open ai moderation API in production? 
https://platform.openai.com/docs/guides/moderation

The moderation endpoint is free to use for most developers. But they have not mentioned API rate limits of this API.
[2024-05-29, 15:04:36] G Kuppuram GenAI Demo Day: No confusion, extract form from pdf with Azure AI, based on extraction, generate form, get data in form, store data in MongoDB.

If you are going to use Microsoft Tech Stacks, it is just a 15 days to 1 month project. As I managed such projects, I am sharing the info.

If you use open source stacks, it may be difficult to move into production. You will have a big advantage with MS in moving into production
[2024-05-29, 15:04:46] Nirant K: A client uses this. The rate limits exist but are generous and you can email them to relax those as well.
[2024-05-29, 16:00:45] ~ Tarun🐍👨‍💻: Hi, 

Has anyone worked on Web Search Tool + LLM?

I am trying to extract the data from the returned links. But the results from the LLM is not very-much promising. Any better search extraction tool recommendations?

PS: Have tried Functional Calling + RAG and Agents execution, no luck. ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-29, 16:05:20] Nirant K: Try Exa.ai for web search. It's a search problem, not LLMs usually
[2024-05-29, 16:05:50] ~ Tarun🐍👨‍💻: Thanks for sharing, will look into it.
[2024-05-29, 16:08:45] Kiran Darisi AtomicWork: Tarun at Atomiwork we use https://tavily.com/ the output is good
[2024-05-29, 16:14:31] Nirant K: Yeah, Tavily is good too
[2024-05-29, 16:15:15] Anil Chandra Naidu Matcha: how does tavily or a web search api curate the results for a web search
[2024-05-29, 16:18:28] Nirant K: By the power of indexing, some use dense embedding - lot of them have prop data of click through ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-29, 16:20:14] ~ Priyankar Kumar: Is Tavily etc actually indexing content or are they a LLM wrapper atop say Bing API or Google
[2024-05-29, 16:23:21] Nirant K: All web search is a blend of query time and indexing. It's not one or the other, it's a bunch of things. For instance, some of them do query expansion behind the scenes which is fast, cheap and get economies of scale on that. 
[2024-05-29, 16:24:31] Nirant K: For instance, every time you Google/Bing/DDG about a celebrity scandal, the odds are they go and index Wiki "Edits" stream for that. Are they a wrapper over Wiki edits then?

[2024-05-29, 16:57:39] ~ Karthikeyan Vijayan: @19377081307 your thoughts on this?
[2024-05-29, 18:55:36] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: There are two mutually conflicting points, just like any other GenAI implementation:
(1) Current methods of information dissemination to the ground are already inadequate or non-existent, and we already have a significant crop loss or post-harvest wastage due to that. GenAI can solve it.
(2) Hallucination is a major problem, and we can solve it with strict RAG and guardrails. Use the full potential of LLMs for only query comprehension part, and use curated KB to generate answers. Our work in vertical LLMs is also directed towards reducing error in conjunction with KB.

With both, we are able to get 100% accuracy in our pilots.

Also, never forget that these folks writing opinion pieces have no experience on the ground, or implementing a system on large scale.
[2024-05-29, 19:08:56] ~ Amlan: Hi. Can someone please point me to any resources, blogs/articles/papers on RAG on PowerPoint files having in mind that these can have charts, graphs and images? Need for doing a POC.

[2024-05-29, 19:58:03] Dr. Pratik Desai KissanAI: Does anyone have Nvidia Nemo Guardrails in production? What is people’s choice of Guardrail library these days?

[2024-05-29, 20:12:39] ~ Ankur Khandelwal: Is it possible to highlight the PDF while using the Open AI assistant?

I want to chat with the PDF using the Open AI assistant, but I also want to highlight the PDF to show which section the data came from.

Or I need to store the pdf into vector database and then highlight it?
[2024-05-29, 20:25:40] ~ Amit Sharma: You'll need to use Adobe API (if there is one) to do anything with the pdf.
[2024-05-29, 20:32:23] jyotirmayjk Hackathon: Adobe has released QnA over PDF in their PDF suite as an extension,if it’s generally available that would be the best way to chat over PDF with your use case
[2024-05-29, 20:45:03] Dhruv Anand: It would depend on what frontend PDF viewer you are using, since OpenAI Assistants API is just your interface with the LLM.
PDF is a fairly open file format/standard, so you can use 3rd party libraries (don't need to be limited by what Adobe offers) to find text on a page (the bounding box). I believe pypdf has this functionality (will look for the link and add here) ‎<This message was edited>
[2024-05-29, 20:47:14] Dhruv Anand: this is what I was referring to:
> https://pymupdf.readthedocs.io/en/latest/page.html#Page.search_for
[2024-05-29, 20:55:45] ~ Ankur Khandelwal: yeah true. but open ai assistant does not give the source (only give pdf file name) - doesn’t give the page number or section reference from where this data come. 

Right now pretty open for the pdf library.
[2024-05-29, 20:57:13] Vetrivel PS: Try PyMuPDF if there any option to highlight content
[2024-05-29, 20:58:59] ~ Ankur Khandelwal: but how to know which section to highlight. Open ai assistant doesn’t give that.
[2024-05-29, 21:00:47] Vetrivel PS: Not sure but the idea is to find the bounding box coordinates and the page number so that the section can be highlighted
[2024-05-29, 21:01:11] ~ Siva: Just tried few...Response speed in Le chat is terribly fast
[2024-05-29, 21:02:00] Ravi Theja: interesting to note that they moved liscence to non-production liscence now - https://mistral.ai/news/mistral-ai-non-production-license-mnpl/

[2024-05-29, 21:20:42] Ankur Pandey: Hi folks

I'm interested to learn about AI agent space - business trends (startups / products being built), interesting usecases esp in non obvious verticals. Also things which are seeing early traction over valuation.

Do share your thoughts on the space, or good resources you have come across.

[2024-05-29, 22:45:06] Dhruv Anand: yeah that's the flexibility that you give up when you use a framework like the Assistants API. Unless they expose a new field for that, you're out of luck (apart from tacking on the phrase search part like I mentioned)

So the problem is that i have a chat history with a system prompt (not using langchain convhistory here), now that system prompt has has some metadata that i want to change with every message from user. Im currently solving this by giving the metadata as context with every user message to the llm but is there a better approach out there for this?
[2024-05-30, 06:31:41] Paras Chopra Wingify: Btw, has anyone been using meta ai?

[2024-05-30, 08:46:06] ~ Khauneesh: As others have pointed out its mostly a search problem than llm issue. We tried a few things which worked for us, the search engine we used was Bing(part of azure enterprise suite) .
1. The search results depend a lot on order of keywords u send to their API, for eg. “Mergers and Acquisitions Visa” and “Visa Mergers and Acquisitions” will retrieve very different results. Thus when sending your keywords to search API based on user query you will need to be mindful of that.
[2024-05-30, 08:53:21] ~ Khauneesh: 2. Once retrieved, directly sending results to your LLM as context in same order might not get best results as retrieval was not properly semantically mappped to original query. If time is not that big a factor you can  rerank the web retrieved snippets from individual links with your query and then final index will look very different from original one.
3. ⁠This should improve quality of QnA over web.
4. ⁠If there are sources other than web as well as part of retrieval they can also be included in the reranking step.

These are a few things which worked for us but still it is far from being 100% correct

Changing prompts would help. First assign scores to segment based on punch. Find flaws and add prompts for correction to the same. Then add up punch and other scores to select. 
This is just chain of reasoning method many use

[2024-05-31, 14:47:22] Prakash Sankar Harbor: ok so glean builds stuff for other people to build enterprise apps with right
[2024-05-31, 14:47:25] Prakash Sankar Harbor: what are the actual enterprise apps?
[2024-05-31, 14:47:45] Prakash Sankar Harbor: or is it something that is deployed for Q/A?
[2024-05-31, 14:48:07] Prakash Sankar Harbor: if so - how does it deal with data security?
[2024-05-31, 14:55:31] ~ Nithin: Glean has an enterprise search product with deep integrations with other enterprise platforms. They claim they will show employees only documents they have access to. That would mean (guess) they will read access data from drive, slack, others etc and use it to supplement the RAG.
[2024-05-31, 14:57:37] Shivendu Kumar: @917407651462 ^
[2024-05-31, 15:01:47] Vignesh Baskaran: I've seen @918763968157 discussing about Glean in the past. He might know more
[2024-05-31, 15:06:48] Prakash Sankar Harbor: right so do enterprises just not care about sending this data off-premise?
[2024-05-31, 15:08:10] Nirant K: Yes, and I'm sure Glean can offer an in-VPC service instead of on-prem.
[2024-05-31, 15:08:28] Prakash Sankar Harbor: so how do they do the onboarding?
[2024-05-31, 15:08:38] Prakash Sankar Harbor: the enterprise requests a GPU and then sits around until theyget it?
[2024-05-31, 15:08:49] Prakash Sankar Harbor: if it's a large model, say mixtral 8x7b, that's a 15K per month cost - how does Glean make money?

[2024-05-31, 15:09:42] Nirant K: I'm sure they don't use this model or something so larger for every query though

What do folks think ?

In the future, i wager, significant fraction of books and writing output in general, will be ai co-created, with ai:human ratio varying on a spectrum (high for tech & fact researchy topics, low for original prose & fiction)

[2024-05-31, 15:31:05] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: Also, if a significant chunk of content on the internet is ai-generated/(ai “curated” as the marketing term by perplexity), how does it impact traditional search engines (which some folks think is slowly dying already) ?
And traditional search ads, seo, monetization ?
[2024-05-31, 15:47:27] Shivendu Kumar: I've heard that OpenAI function calling adds extra latency. Is it true?

[2024-05-31, 16:35:40] Shan: I have a (perhaps unpopular) way of thinking about content. Basically in today’s day and age, content = $. Unless perplexity does some sort of monetisation it’s hard for this to succeed.
[2024-05-31, 16:35:56] ~ Shivam Malpani: I think the output is decent
[2024-05-31, 16:37:08] ashish Acgt01 Twitter: human generated content = $

[2024-05-31, 16:45:32] ~ Mayank: Hi folks,

[2024-05-31, 18:39:16] Prakash Sankar Harbor: 1. It's not as easy as you think. My anchor customer had to do work.
2. It's also a huge PITA --> how do you prevent a drop off in onboarding if you have this requirement? The turnaround time can be a week. ON top of that the customer now has to do boring work.

Not worth doing it locally
[2024-05-31, 20:29:54] ~ Nitin Kalra: Have you checked salad?

Civit.ai mentions them.. A lot of users generate images on civit on free tier..

And they use salad gpu cloud, which uses consumer grade gpu like nvidia rtx 3080 which has 8 gb gpu ram
[2024-05-31, 20:31:29] ~ Atishay: I understood it as 8GB “CPU” ram. 

At that point best to use runpod/ colab/ etc. Definitely not local.
[2024-05-31, 20:34:26] ~ Nitin Kalra: Don't know about training

But you can use ollama and vllm

I have tried both works.. But you can run only quantized models of llms like mistral 7b properly

[2024-05-31, 22:13:44] ~ Rishiraj Acharya: Have you tried using Indexify? They have extractors specifically for this use case.. It can successfully extract even complex tables with no defined boundaries which almost every other pdf parser fails. Check https://getindexify.ai

[2024-05-31, 23:33:06] Vishnu Ramesh - Subtl.ai: Do they host the LLM on the VPC too?
[2024-05-31, 23:43:56] ~ Tanmay Sachan: I'm unsure about the LLM suggestions they output.

We have an internal llm so its possible they just have some prompt APIs setup for custom models.

[2024-06-02, 02:49:19] Arghya Bhattacharya Enterpet, Equal: Hey everyone, any thoughts/resources on scaling live speec-to-text for thousands of concurrent users using transformers models that need about 5/8 gb vram? 

main concerns are around dynamic batching to increase utilisation
[2024-06-02, 11:28:37] ~ Shubham: Hi everyone,
I don't think I get the point of synthetic datasets. If synthetic data generated by LLMs is good enough to train/fine-tune an LLM, it should be good enough for the task at hand.
[2024-06-02, 11:29:48] ~ Shubham: If it's not, synthetic data won't be good either and fine-tuned model won't perform any better.
[2024-06-02, 11:30:29] ~ Pushkar Aggrawal: Triton works well
[2024-06-02, 11:35:38] ~ Pushkar Aggrawal: Using claude generated data to finetune a llama3 8b would be useful though right?
[2024-06-02, 11:36:55] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: https://arxiv.org/abs/2304.12244
[2024-06-02, 11:37:04] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Synthetic data is the secret to models.
[2024-06-02, 11:37:26] Sandeep Srinivasa RedCarpetup: Literally everyone I know uses evol-instruct today
[2024-06-02, 11:39:22] ~ Shubham: Yes, this is one use case I understand. If a better model generates data to train a smaller model, it makes sense.
[2024-06-02, 11:53:02] Nirant K: Yeah, I don't get the points of gym machines either. I mean, the point of machines is to reduce effort 😂
[2024-06-02, 11:54:45] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: It is reducing effort to deal with health issues down the road ? 😂
[2024-06-02, 11:55:15] Nirant K: That's the job of sports.
[2024-06-02, 11:55:32] Sthit Generative AI WhatsApp Group: Both.
[2024-06-02, 11:55:38] ~ Shubham: Yeah, if the max weight you put on a squat rack is 10 KG, when you can lift 80 KG, it won't improve your performance, would it?
[2024-06-02, 11:56:57] ~ Shubham: Man, it's a real question I have. I can do without clever comebacks.
[2024-06-02, 11:57:59] Nirant K: If the lift strength would transfer to squats (for everyone else: claim is large models don't need synthetic data for specific tasks) — yes, you're correct.

The challenge is we need and want task specific strengths — that's why we train for them. And synthetic data (much like gym machines) help us do that.
[2024-06-02, 11:58:40] Nirant K: Strengths/talents/competencies whatever is your chosen phrasing for this — they're usually task specific to models (and often humans too) and at best domain specific in other cases
[2024-06-02, 11:59:01] Nirant K: LLMs "generalize" quite well from one task to another, and this was the core insight from multi-task training era
[2024-06-02, 11:59:35] Nirant K: And that's why we train on multiple tasks — from QA to generate JSON, and LLMs fill in (some version of interpolation) the tasks in between. 
[2024-06-02, 12:00:26] Nirant K: Evol-Instruct is already mentioned here. So I'm building a bridge to this idea, instead of expanding on Evol-Instruct idea itself
[2024-06-02, 12:04:28] ~ Shubham: Thanks, Nirant. I think I get it now for specific tasks :)
More context: I wanted to fine-tune a model for creating Manim visualisations: https://docs.manim.community/en/stable/examples.html

My intuition after writing a lot of manim prompts is - the reason text to manim is difficult is because LLMs can't keep track of positions. E.g when you ask it "Draw 3 boxes and change the colour of the first box and write an equation over 2nd box" LLMs just lose it.

Someone suggested using Synthetic data. Here, I don't think LLMs can generate good data.
