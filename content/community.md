✅ - Please do these behaviours!

❌ - These may result in bans

👎 - we discourage these behaviours, but context matters

These guides are good rules of thumbs for behaviour, but admins reserve all rights to remove or ban members or conversations. 

## Content sharing

✅ Things that you find interesting, curious or noteworthy around AI research, philosophy, implementation and future. Also new tools or how you’re using them. 

✅ Give context when sharing if possible, or ask questions, especially if you are looking for a specific kind of help

❌ Self promotion of your products, your company or your events. Group should not be used as your marketing channel. 

👎 Sharing paid/paywalled content. You can describe if something is relevant to the discussion but sharing this content is discouraged

## General conversation

✅ Ask questions, especially follow ups if a conversation or topic intrigues you

✅ Share knowledge that you have with the community members, we can only grow the AI community in India if we help each other out

✅ Act in good faith and with integrity. When in doubt ask

✅ Disclose any conflicts of interests in a particular conversation

❌ Conversations about topics with proven harm technologies like deep fakes, surveillance, or discrimination promoting tech. 

❌ Harassment or abuse, targeted towards a group or an individual

👎 Off topic discussions. Avoid spamming others’ inboxes with messages irrelevant to the group. Take those discussions to DMs

👎 Sensationalism and exaggerations. 

👎 Don’t ask to just ask. Do some preliminary research beforehand.
