Like most of my essays, this essay is written for myself from few years ago.

Software Engineering, and it's cousins like Computer Science are unique. Unlike relatively mature domains of say, linear algebra - the field is still growing and not yet coherent. That makes it some what hard to study and _master_.

This also means we have a unique opportunity here. This makes it better to work in a field which is not yet c
