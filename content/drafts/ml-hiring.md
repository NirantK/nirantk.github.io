## Do
- Seniormost hire first: Start by hiring the senior most person you're going to hire. E.g. start by hiring the ML Lead (assuming you already have a CTO)
- Have a means to tell that your investment in data science is working out or not
- Closest to User first: Hire the person who will consume the data to build for the user first
- Sourcing: Begin sourcing early and over-emphasise two channels: Referrals and Portfolios
    - Typically, in India - expect:
        - ~2 months to close a full time role at early career (0-3 years) and 
        - ~3 months to close a mid career (3-7 years) and
        - 6+ months to close a senior hire
- If a developer has open source code contributions in the last 2-3 years, consider waving off the coding or algorithmic challenge to speed up the interview process
- Pay above market cash salaries
    - In 12-18 months from now, when your ML Engineer will have internalised all the requirements, company culture and built a bunch of important tooling - she would get an offer which is 2-3x of today. If you're already paying above market salaries, a 20-30% jump is quite often enough to retain many folks 
- Have 3 at least versions of your shipping timeline
- Do hire [full stack Data Science people/teams](https://nirantk.com/writing/building-a-data-science-team.html).  If you're hiring for early members for your team, this is practical necessity. An example of T shaped skills could look like

## Don't
- Rely on HR or your usual backend engineering hiring channels to work well for you, in general
- Don't hire the person who builds the means to move data (e.g. ML before data engineering) before hiring atleast 1-2 stakeholders in ML
    - Why? This is because it's cheaper (and often faster) to change ML modeling approach than to make changes in data engineering pipelines
- Don't start by hiring an intern to implement papers or take things to production before you've done them
- Don't expect data science to deliver or ship at the same "user value" pace as Product Engineering
    - Why? Data Science suffers from the twin problems of being new and experiment-driven
- Don't assume that you've so much data, and since all of it is queryable, it's all usable
- Hire ultra-specialists e.g. post-docs and PhDs too early, barring products which requires invention and not application
