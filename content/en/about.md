As a consultant and advisor:
- I specialize in working with Early stage founders, 0 to 1 stage of product development or later stage, adding a new feature to an existing product
- For non-coding founders, I act as a tour guide for advanced AI technologies - improving their understanding of potential applications and limitations alike

This includes things like **LLMs** and **Vector Databases**, which are amazing tools which unlock a lot of new, intelligent value but also have their own limits.

Trivia:
1. Dr. Andrew Ng recommends [Awesome NLP](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp), a repo I've maintained since 2018 at Stanford's Deep Learning course [CS 230](https://cs230.stanford.edu/section/1/).
2. My blog have been appreciated by Noble Laureate Dr. Paul Romer [on Twitter](https://twitter.com/paulmromer/status/985518009879089152)
3. I have written a [book](#book) on Natural Language Processing 

I am on a sabbatical. I enjoy my time playing board games, running India's largest GenerativeAI community. 
I am learning to be better at software library design ([agentai](https://github.com/NirantK/agentai)) and [writing](/writing). 

## Background

Machine Learning and AI Engineer with 7+ years of experience in chat bots, retrieval, ranking and language modeling. 

As a Machine Learning Engineer,
- I trained the first [Hindi LM](https://github.com/NirantK/hindi2vec)
- Deployed Sentence Transformers and Annoy (vector search library) for Semantic
- Managed a team of 3 engineers to build a support chatbot for a Nifty 100 company

As an AI Engineer,
- Have built and deployed Question Answering systems for 3+ years, including 2 projects with OpenAI LLMs e.g. text-davinci-003, GPT3.5 and GPT4
- Hallucination-free summarization and question answering systems


## Book

Book: [NLP in Python: Quickstart Guide](https://read.amazon.in/kp/embed?asin=B07L3PLQS1&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_MRBPRC9ZWRC8B4SKT74X)

Code: [Github](https://github.com/NirantK/nlp-python-deep-learning)

I wrote this book in 2018 to make Natural Language Programming more accessible for software engineers and programmers. This had a very design and code-first view of tools and their limitations. Today, most of it is outdated, I do not recommend buying it.
