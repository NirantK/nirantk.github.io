# About

Our community is a vibrant nexus connecting over 2,000 AI enthusiasts, predominantly in Bangalore and San Francisco. It's a congregation of high-impact professionals including CTOs, senior ML engineers, and open-source hackers from influential projects and startups like Guardrails, Ragas, Llama Index, Qdrant, FastEmbed, KissanAI, Sarvam, Portkey, and more.

Each month, our community engages over 200 active members. We discuss topics ranging from compute cost improvements via vLLM to latency and evaluations.

As a team, we have done monthly events since February, which include talks, demo days, hackathons, and a 24-hour hackathon. Our speakers have included industry luminaries like Amod Malviya (Flipkart/Udaan) and Prof. Pratyush (AI4Bharat/Sarvam), offering invaluable insights into the latest AI advancements.

Our community's impact is evident in the success stories it has nurtured. Ragas has evolved into a business and recently got into YCombinator. Previous speaker Ravi Theja found a significant roles at Llama Index, while collaborator Shivendu Kumar joined Qdrant. Notably, FastEmbed itself was born out of the community's articulated needs, exemplifying our commitment to fostering real-world AI solutions.

In essence, our community is not just a forum for discussion but a melting pot for AI Engineering innovation and collaboration. You can join us on WhatsApp [here](https://nas.io/the-generativeai-group).
