# Writing

Hello, I'm Nirant. I write about a mix of consulting, open source, personal work, and applying llms. 

I won't email you more than twice a month, not every post I write is worth sharing but I'll do my best to share the most interesting stuff including my own writing, thoughts, and experiences.
