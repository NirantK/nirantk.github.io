title: Fail Resume
---

A fail resume is, as its name suggests, a list of rejections and setbacks.

This concept originated in [academia](https://www.nytimes.com/2019/02/03/smarter-living/failure-resume.html), but can be applied to improve one’s career, resilience, and approach to challenges in any walk of life.

I’ve organized my setbacks by year (starting with 2016), and what constitutes a “failure” (or _fail_) here is based solely on my own judgement. 
It’s important to not only list the failures, but also learn from them, so I will add reflections to some of them (in progress). 

# 2021
- Never heard back from [Forethought.ai](https://forethought.ai/), [Coinbase](https://www.coinbase.com/). Had applied via the cold form on their websites.
- Rejected by [Flowrite](https://flowrite.com/) because they could not afford me
- Ghosted by [XFlowPay](https://xflowpay.com/) in mid-August
- Ghosted by Google Recruiter in July

# 2020
- Rejected by UMass, UW, CMU Language Technolog, UCB MIMS, and bunch of other Grad school programs because of a bad recco
  - Lesson Learnt: Never trust an American
- Sahil, the Product Manager and Verloop and Piyush, the CTO at Verloop quit -- atleast in part because I think I overwhelmed them
- Got cold-rejected by someone I thought it'd work out with romantically

# 2019
- Spent 6 weeks prototyping a solution at Verloop.io which doesn't break even on cost
  - Lesson Learnt: In Enterprise SaaS, never write any code before someone tells you what they are willing to pay for that
- Tried to get better at DevOps, but ultimately could not because of lack of discipline

# 2018
- Did not even get interview callbacks from my favourite NLP Company at the time: [Rasa](https://rasa.com/)
- Had to quit Soroco because of lack of opportunities to grow internally. Really loved the crew, which was smart but not agile or humble
- Did not even apply to GoJek, Linkedin and Swiggy's kickass Data Science teams
  - Lesson learnt: Be proactive. Take moonshots. Setting an upper-cap on your ambitions is kinda stupid

# 2017
- Samsung: Filed for two patents -- which despite being selected, eventually never materialised

# 2016
- Did not even clear Amazon's first programming round on campus
