title: PeakXV Summit Hackathon!
---

Last weekend, I was a [mentor](https://x.com/peakxvpartners/status/1879466118857035885) at the [PeakXV Summit Hackathon](https://summithack.peakxv.com/). This year's theme was Consumer AI. 

It was a fantastic hackathon with exceptional organization by the PeakXV team. The space which they selected and the overall timeline was quite good, the organization ranging from food to Internet and credits was quite neat and well done. 

It was safe to say that the 5-7 ideas that I interacted with ranged from the extremely mundane to boring [1]. The most interesting attempt was the game world generation from [Rajeev Singh Naruka](https://x.com/toughyear). I'm glad to hear that he did win the overall hackathon and as a long time friend I'm very very happy for him. 

The media winners were Sheetal Chauhan (Microsoft, Sarvam) and Vijit. 

The AI Journaling idea was quite interesting though that's closer to a prosumer idea from an indiehackers perspective than a consumer one. 

[1] Ideas: 3x AI Assistant for the CEO to book cab, order groceries using voice + computer use, AI Journaling, Superhuman for WhatsApp.
