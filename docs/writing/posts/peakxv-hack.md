title: Congratulations to Rajeev Singh Naruka for Winning PeakXV Summit Hackathon!
---

Last weekend, I was a [mentor](https://x.com/peakxvpartners/status/1879466118857035885) at the [PeakXV Summit Hackathon](https://summithack.peakxv.com/). This year's theme was Consumer AI. It was safe to say that the 5-7 ideas that I interacted with ranged from the extremely mundane to boring [1].

The most interesting attempt was the game world generation from Rajeev Singh Naruka. I'm glad to hear that he did win the overall hackathon and as a long time friend I'm very very happy for him. 

[1] Ideas: 3x AI Assistant for the CEO to book cab, order groceries using voice + computer use, AI Journaling, Superhuman for WhatsApp.
