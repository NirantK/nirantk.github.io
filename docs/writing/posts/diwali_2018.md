title: 'Diwali 2018: Annual Letter'
---

How are you?

I send these letters every year. This is a way for me to send thanks to all the mentors and friends who've been part of my journey so far. And I wanted to drop by and say 

## Happy Diwali :) 

**What is up with you? Is there something I can do for you?** 

For what is up with me? 
 
## Health & Wealth
### Health 
Since the beginning of this year, I have tried 'building better healthy habits'. Progress so far:

1. Have spent 5000+ minutes working out 
2. Improved my BMI from 32.4 to 30.1 (lost 7 kg)

I am  going to spend the next 12-24 months on health. Particularly learning to manage my allergy and asthmatic conditions better. This will be my top non-work priority. 

## Work
**A Year with [**Soroco**](http://www.soroco.com/)**
I completed a year with Soroco. I have a sense that my strengths are probably not in core AI/software. Yet to figure out where they are. **What do you think?** 
 
## Reading (Learning?)
Last year, I wrote how [When Breath Becomes Air](https://www.amazon.in/When-Breath-Becomes-Paul-Kalanithi/dp/1847923674) has been very influential to me. This year, I've been into online blogs such as:

- **Thinking Better:** Farnam Street ([mental models](https://fs.blog/general-thinking-tools/)), Morgan Housel ([Different Kinds of Smart](https://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/different-kinds-of-smart/)), Ribbon Farm ([Premium Mediocre](https://www.ribbonfarm.com/2017/08/17/the-premium-mediocre-life-of-maya-millennial/)), Derek Sivers ([Obvious to You, Amazing to Others](https://sivers.org/obvious)) - which resulted in me contributing to open source
- **Dreaming Better:** I binge-read through a few books by author's like Dushka Zapata, and Javed Akhtar. Reading Hindi, specially poetry - strung a new chord with me. It instantly brought black flashes of memory fro my early teens which I had all but forgotten. If you have any scifi recommendations - I'd love to read 1-2 this year. 

The other essay which I mentioned last year was [The Case Against Work Life Balance](http://shyamsankar.com/the-case-against-work-life-balance-owning-your-future)**.** The core idea? As long as you're fit, it's better to strive to improve work to the point where it fills your life with contentment. An year of experimentation later - I have a better handle of when this may or may not apply. It seems to be mostly true, except when it's not. 

## Outside Work
Owing to about 2% better mental discipline and focus, I had a *lot more* free cycles since March. This resulted in me spending less time with my phone (and laptop) but mostly thinking deeply and creating something: 

- Economics Nobel Laureate, Dr. Paul M Romer (2018) found my notes on programming tools helpful ([link to his Tweet](https://twitter.com/paulmromer/status/985518009879089152))
- **Writing a book on Natural Language Processing**, for software engineers - and comes out before Christmas on Amazon!
- Won an International Fellowship with [Fast AI](https://www.fast.ai/) for their advanced AI (deep learning) course

Few more small wins slightly more technical: 

- Won the first ever Natural Language Processing themed Kaggle Kernel award - that's about $500 in cash, $390 in software ([Twitter link](https://twitter.com/kaggle/status/1050844006794416129))
- State of the Art results on Language Modeling for Hindi: [Github Repo](http://github.com/NirantK/hindi2vec)
- Finished in Top 10 at the Global AI for Education Hackathon ([link](https://medium.com/opened-ai/global-hackweek-winners-2017-a9e5da513270))
- Lead Maintainer to the Github's Official Natural Language Processing Repo, featured in their ML Collection too ([NLP Repo link](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp/), [ML Collection link](https://github.com/collections/machine-learning))

## What's Next? 
I'm still working out the chinks, on the wetware that I am - and I'm eager to hear any feedback that you might've.

Cheers,
Nirant
