I wanted to drop by and wish you a very Happy Diwali!

This is an annual email that I write to say thanks to mentors, friends, allies - everyone who has chipped in sculpt a better me.
 
So that is what I'll begin with: Thanks a ton for being there for me!

Also, checkout the 2018 edition of the annual email in attachment if you're curious :) 

Moving onto the least comfortable piece, talking about myself:

## Health
This has been a year of regression. For instance: 

- My BMI has slipped from 30 to 33 (higher is worse), gained about 7 kgs
- Have worked out less than 2000 minutes (was 5000 minutes last year)
- Have made tremendous unmeasured progress in managing my long term asthma, now I can frequently run up 2 floors without noticing that I did

## Wealth

- I was trying to invest in things other than mutual funds. Well, I've lost 25% of whatever Iâ€™ve invested in stocks (via smallcase) since then
- I hired a financial advisor, which was a net loss making deal due to the fees, but helped me form better habits. Financial advisor in that sense are like gym trainers, more than the exercise - their main value addition is in *following up*
- Iâ€™ve reduced my Fixed Deposit and Recurring Deposit investments to 0% of my savings
- Iâ€™m diversifying my folio to a mix of index and bond funds now - this is still work in progress

## Learning and Reading
Last year, I wrote how I was trying to think and dream better. Well, that has been a bust. The intent was to form a mental model, a scaffold of habits and information on which I could add new information and refine the scaffold itself.

This has been slower than Iâ€™d have guessed.

Intentionally, I read less books this year. I did read a lot more modern essays (blogs?) ranging from Peter Drucker, Marc Andressen, Naval Ravikant, and surprisingly boring, a former Coal India Chairman. I also re-read a couple of books like [Courage to Be Disliked](https://www.amazon.in/dp/B074TWG8V7/) and [Effective Engineer](https://www.amazon.in/Effective-Engineer-Engineering-Disproportionate-Meaningful/dp/0996128107). 
 
I also spent an unhealthy time reading beginner content on seemingly irrelevant topics like Policy making and Human Capital. Here is my favourite cross-topic discovery so far: [Talent vs Luck: The role of randomness in success and failure.](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.07068.pdf) 

## Work
Since last Diwali, I quit Soroco and moved to Verloop.io - a really small, pre-Product Market Fit, loss-making business. I strongly considered a very enticing data science role at an investment bank. I finally leaned away from it, making a financially very expensive gut call.

The role here is challenging in two very important ways: 

- Autonomy: There is a much higher degree of autonomy on how I prioritize tasks and that has been scarier than Iâ€™d thought
- Leading: I also hired 3 Machine Learning engineers who now work with me

The thing that could unlock 10x value? Technical and Learning-to-Manage Mentorship: Something I could really use a lot of help on, is critically missing.

The other welcome change is in how anxious I am about *work:* I am not! 
I am almost always excited to go work.

## Work Adjacent

- Public Speaking: I was invited to speak at PyCon India 2019 - Indiaâ€™s top conference on the Python programming language
- Open Source: Iâ€™ve continued to maintain [Awesome-NLP](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp/) for years now. It now has over 9 thousand stars and 80+ contributors now. Itâ€™s officially recommended by [Stanford](https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/awesome-nlp-now-recommended-stanford-nirant-kasliwal/) to their Deep Learning students now. 


## What's Next?
1. Writing and Tact

I suspect more knowledge workers in 20s should invest in learning how to communicate via either public speaking or writing. My chosen medium will probably be writing. I intend to write about a select list of topics: technology and how it has shaped our choices.

Owing partly to how I grew up, my default communication style has been *confrontational.* I'll incorporate a lot more tact, grace and consideration in the years ahead. Be more [Kabira.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g26k6M8x1m8) 

2. Chase external validation

My professional and personal framework so far been focused internally. I did not value traditional credentials like degrees, grades, that exclusive college club and so on very highly. In hindsight, this was a bad career decision. 

External validation is what sets apart sustainable, long term careers from short one-trick wonders. This mindset shift will be hard. And will probably be a long 5-15 year journey, and Iâ€™ll keep you posted - unless you want me to stop. Just let me know ðŸ™‚ 
 
Till then, Happy Diwali and a Happy New Year!

Best,
Nirant
