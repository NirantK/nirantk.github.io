I am a Machine Learning/AI Engineer. I started [Scaled Focus](https://scaledfocus.com) to help companies evaluate, optimize and deploy agents. 

I have written a [book](#book) on Natural Language Processing for software engineers. 

I have also contributed to [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas), built [FastEmbed](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed) and maintained [Awesome NLP](https://github.com/keon/awesome-nlp).

## Book

Book: [NLP in Python: Quickstart Guide](https://read.amazon.in/kp/embed?asin=B07L3PLQS1&preview=newtab&linkCode=kpe&ref_=cm_sw_r_kb_dp_MRBPRC9ZWRC8B4SKT74X) has sold over 5000 copies.

I wrote this book in 2018 to make Natural Language Programming more accessible for software engineers and programmers. The accompanying code is available on [Github](https://github.com/NirantK/nlp-python-deep-learning).
## Papers and Open Source Contributions

1. [Ragas](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas) - We helped improve the most widely used Agent Metrics layer. My contributions are [here](https://github.com/explodinggradients/ragas/pulls?q=is%3Apr+author%3ANirantK+is%3Aclosed+).

2. [FastEmbed](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed) - I built the first version of FastEmbed, an embedding library built for speed using ONNX. It is used by Qdrant, [NVIDIA Nemo Guardrails](https://github.com/NVIDIA/nemo-guardrails) and [3000+ more respositories alone!](https://github.com/qdrant/fastembed/network/dependents).

3. OpenAI Cookbook: [Fine-tuned Retrieval Augmented Generation with Qdrant](https://github.com/openai/openai-cookbook/blob/main/examples/fine-tuned_qa/ft_retrieval_augmented_generation_qdrant.ipynb)

4. Hinglish: [github](https://github.com/NirantK/Hinglish), [paper](https://aclanthology.org/2020.semeval-1.119/) focussed on code-mixed languages was published in ACL 2019.
